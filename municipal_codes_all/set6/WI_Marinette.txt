1.0102 PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION
A. The following rules or meanings shall be applied in the construction and
interpretation of Ordinances unless such application would be clearly
inconsistent with the plain meaning or intent of the Ordinances:
1. Acts by Agents. When an ordinance requires an act be done by a
person which may be legally performed by an authorized agent of that
principal person, the requirement shall be construed to include all acts
performed by such agents.
2. Code and Code of Ordinances. The words "Codes," "Municipal
Code", and "Code of Ordinances" when used in any section of this
Code shall refer to this Code of General Ordinances of the City of
Marinette unless the context of the section clearly indicates otherwise.
3. Computation of Time. In computing any period of time prescribed or
allowed by these Ordinances, the day of the act or event from which
the period of time begins to run shall not be included, but the last day
of the period shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a
legal holiday. If the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than
seven (7) days, Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be
excluded in the computation. As used in this Section, "legal holiday"
means any statewide legal holiday specified by state law.
4. Fine. The term "fine" shall be the equivalent of the word "forfeiture",
and vice versa.
5. Gender. Every word in these Ordinances referring to the masculine
gender shall also be construed to apply to females, and vice versa.
6. General Rule. All words and phrases shall be construed according to
their plain meaning in common usage. However, words or phrases
with a technical or special meaning shall be understood and construed
according to that technical or special meaning if such is the intent of
the Ordinances.
7. Joint Authority. All words purporting to give a joint authority to three
(3) or more City officers or employees shall be construed as giving
such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons.
8. Person. The word "person" shall mean any of the following entities:
natural persons, corporations, partnerships, associations, bodies
politic, or any other entity of any kind which is capable of being sued.
9. Repeal. When any ordinance having the effect of repealing a prior
ordinance is itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to
revive the prior ordinance or any part thereof, unless expressly so
provided.
10. Singular and Plural. Every word in these Ordinances referring to the
singular number only shall also be construed to apply to several
City of Marinette 1-3 Code of Ordinances
persons or things, and every word in these Ordinances referred to a
plural number shall also be construed to apply to one (1) person or
thing.
11. Tense. The use of any verb in the present tense shall not preclude the
interpretation of the verb in the future tense where appropriate.
12. Wisconsin Statutes. The term "Wisconsin Statutes" and its
abbreviation as "Wis. Stats." shall mean, in these Ordinances, the
Wisconsin Statutes for the year 1981-82.

Code" and its abbreviation as "Wis. Adm. Code" shall mean the

provisions of each individual chapter shall control all issues arising out of
the events and persons intended to be governed by that chapter.

other, the provision which is more specific in its application to the events or
persons raising the conflict shall control over the more general provision.
1.0104 SEPARABILITY OF PROVISIONS
If any provision of this Municipal Code is for any reason held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by reason of any decision of any court of competent jurisdiction,

Organization (attached hereto as Exhibit “A” to this Employee Manual) shall be classified as
“benefits eligible” positions. Part-time positions listed in the attached Table of Organization
shall be entitled to pro-rated benefits as outlined below, with the following exceptions:
After 2011 Wisconsin Act 10/32, new hires who were not previously employed by the City
of Marinette (a WRS participating employer), are required to work at least 1,200 hours per
year (increased from the prior 600 hours per year) in order to be eligible for WRS benefits.
According to 2011 Wisconsin Act 10/32, current employees hired prior to 2011 Wisconsin
Act 10/32 are “grandfathered” as follows:
Employees of the City of Marinette who were hired prior to 2011 Wisconsin Act 10/32, and
who worked more than 600 hours per year prior to 2011 Wisconsin Act 10/32, remain
eligible for WRS benefits even if they worked less than 1,200 hours per year after 2011

hours at the time of employment or subsequently changed by formal action divided by
forty (40). Example: 30 hours per week divided by 40 = 75%
City of Marinette 3-17 Code of Ordinances
(2) Personal Leave. After completion of two (2) full years of continuous employment,
the employee shall earn paid personal leave equal to the percentage pro-ration
multiplied by the number of hours defined for a full-time employee. Example: 75% x 8
hours = 6 hours. Unused personal leave cannot be carried over to any following year.
Personal leave cannot be taken in less than one-hour increments. The employee must
provide forty-eight (48) hour advance notice to the employee’s supervisor of the

hours. Example 2: 75% x 800 accumulated hours = 600 accumulated hours.

employee earns pro-rated vacation. Earned vacation shall equal the percentage proration
multiplied by the number of hours defined for a full-time employee. Example:
75% x 40 hours for one-year employee = 30 hours. Pro-rated vacation hours may be
carried over in accordance with the Employee Manual. The maximum number of
vacation hours that can be carried over equals the percentage pro-ration multiplied by
the number of hours defined for a full-time employee. Upon termination of
employment, vacation shall be pro-rated for the last year of employment according to
the actual number of days worked.
(5) Holiday Pay. If, on the last regular workday before as well as the first regular

workdays, then the employee shall receive holiday pay. Holiday pay is defined as the

pay. Overtime shall be paid for any hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week.
(7) Medical and Dental Insurance. The employee who elects to participate in the City’s
insurance plan shall receive pro-rated medical and dental insurance. The employee’s
cost share for medical and dental insurance shall equal the monthly insurance cost less
the City share calculated for a full-time employee less the percentage pro-ration times
the City share. Example: $1,200 monthly insurance cost. $1,200 x 90% = $1,080 fulltime
City share. $1,080 x 75% = $810 part-time City share. $1,200 - $810 = $390
employee’s monthly share. (ordinance 2011-2218 adopted 12-6-2011).

premium. The coverage amount is equal to the employee’s annual salary. An employee
may purchase up to an additional three (3) units of life insurance and one (1) unit of
supplemental life insurance. The coverage amount for each additional unit is equal to
the employee’s annual salary. The employee may purchase life insurance on a spouse
and/or dependent at the employee’s expense.
(11) Funeral Leave. The employee may take pro-rated funeral leave equal to the
percentage pro-ration multiplied by the number of hours defined for a full-time
employee. Example: 75% x 24 funeral leave hours = 18 funeral leave hours.

purposes of calculating part-time employee benefits under this ordinance includes:
Medical and Dental Insurance. The City currently offers health, dental and vision
insurance for its full-time employees. Effective 01/01/18 through 12/31/18, the City will

3.0405 ACCESS PROCEDURES
A. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A
request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested
record or information requested. However, a request for a record without a
reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by
the record doesn’t constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made
orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the
request is commenced under Section 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided
below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is
unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request
may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment
of a fee is required under Section 3.0404(F)(6). A requester may be required
to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a
private residence or whenever security reasons or Federal law or regulations
so require.
B. Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable
and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the
authority's determination to deny the request, in whole or in part, and the
reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City
Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly
time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to
itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable
compliance.
C. A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 3.0406. If a
request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for
a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the
requester within five (5) business days of the oral denial. If a written request
is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement
of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request
shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in
writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ
of mandamus under Section 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the
Attorney General or a District Attorney.

with the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he
or she deter-mines that the harm to the public interest resulting from
disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the request
record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include,
but are not limited to, the following:
1. Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were
necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them.

that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the
information that may be made public and delete the information that may
not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall
confer with the City Attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall
follow the guidance of the City Attorney when separating out the exempt
material. If in the judgment of the custodian and the City Attorney there is

material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt
material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.

A. Owner's Responsibility
The owner, lessee, occupant, or person in charge of each and every building
or structure or unoccupied lot in the City of Marinette fronting or abutting
any street shall clean, or cause to be cleaned, the sidewalk in front of or
adjoining each such home, building, or unoccupied lot, as the case may be
of snow or ice to the width of such sidewalk within twenty-four (24) hours
of the cessation of such snowfall and shall cause the same to be kept clear
from ice and snow, provided that when the ice has formed on any sidewalk
so that it cannot be immediately removed, the persons herein referred to
shall keep the same sprinkled with salt, sawdust, or sand, and shall, as soon
thereafter as the weather shall permit, thoroughly clean such sidewalk.
B. City's Option to Clear Sidewalks
In the event of failure of the lessee, occupant, person having charge, or

(24) hour period, the Department of Public Works may remove the
snow and ice from sidewalks. (See MMC 9.1302 Schedule A for fees)
(Ordinance 2007-2085 adopted 3-6-07). This, however, does not remove the

removing snow and/or ice from the sidewalk and said person or entity shall
retain responsibility for any liability accruing because of failure to remove
snow and/or ice from the sidewalk and adjacent areas. The charges shall be
set forth in a statement to the City Clerk who, in turn, shall mail the same to
the owner, occupant, or person having charge of the subject premises. If

responsible for its handling at their own expense without depositing same in
the right-of-ways, ditches, public streets, or alleys.

the snow. For subsequent violations, the Department of Public Works may
remove the snow at the same cost multiplied by the number of times the
Department of Public Works shall have removed the snow. This, however,
does not remove the responsibility of the lessee, occupant, person having
charge or owner from removing said snow, and said persons or entities shall
retain responsibility for any liability accruing because of failure to remove
said snow. The charges shall be set forth in a statement onto the City Clerk
who, in turn, shall mail the same to the owner, occupant, or person in
charge of the subject premises. If said statement is not paid in thirty (30)
days thereafter, the statement shall be reported to the City Treasurer who

parcel of land, and the same shall be collected in all respects like other taxes
upon real estate, or as provided under Wisconsin Statutes Section

by
the Use of Best Management Practices.
The owner or operator of any activity, operation, or facility which
may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into
waters of the state or the MS4 through the use of structural and
non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property
or premise, that is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional
structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to waters of the state or the MS4. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid permit authorizing the discharge of
storm water associated with industrial activity or construction
activity, to the maximum extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section.
L. Notification of Spills
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in
illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the MS4,
or waters of the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release, so as
to minimize the impacts of the discharge.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services, and shall also notify the Public Works
Department. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said
person shall notify the Public Works Department in person or by phone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the Public Works Department within [3] business days of the
phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the
actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained
for at least [5] years.

violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, or
any order issued hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are
likely to recur, and that the person’s violation(s) has (have)
caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the
MS4 or waters of the state which reasonably appears to present
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare
of persons or to the environment, the Public Works Department
may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to
cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator
to:
(1) Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements;
and
(2) Take such appropriate preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge.
(3) Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it
under
44
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
this Subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate
its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure
to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the
Public Works Department may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of
the state, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment,
including immediate termination of a facility’s water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The Public
Works Department may allow the person to recommence its
discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Public Works Department that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated
against the discharger under this ordinance. A person that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Public
Works Department within [30] days of receipt of the prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the violator.

The Public Works Department may, without prior notice,
suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with
a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the Public Works
Department may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to
minimize danger to persons.
(c) Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge
(1) Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this
ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
Public Works
Department will notify a violator of the proposed termination of
its MS4 access.
(2) A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4
access to premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without
the prior approval of the Public Works Department.
5. Prosecution and Penalties
Any person violating any provision of this ordinance shall be
subject
to a forfeiture of not less than $25.00 nor more than $10,000.00 and

6.0603 Post-Construction Storm Water Management
A. Authority
1. This ordinance is adopted by the City Council under the authority
granted by s. 62.234, for cities, Wis. Stats. This ordinance
supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under s.
62.23, Wis. Stats., that relate to storm water management regulations.
Except as otherwise specified in s. 62.234, Wis. Stats., s. 62.23, Wis.
Stats., applies to this ordinance and to any amendments to this
ordinance.
2. The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other
lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body.
3. The City Council hereby designates the Public Works Department to
administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
4. The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt more stringent storm
water management requirements that may be imposed by any of the
following:
61
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
(a) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules,
permits or approvals including those authorized under ss. 281.16 and
283.33, Wis. Stats.
(b) Targeted performance standards promulgated in rules by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under s. NR 151.004, Wis.
Adm. Code.
B. Findings of Fact
The City Council finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a
significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general
welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of
natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff
can:
1. Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion,
increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge,
diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature.
2. Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic
life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant
loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals,
bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
3. Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by
increasing pollutant loads.
4. Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
5. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage
facilities.
6. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
increasing major flood peaks and volumes.
7. Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and
levels of flooding.
C. Purpose and Intent
1. Purpose. The general purpose of this ordinance is to establish longterm,
post-construction runoff management requirements that will
diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic
environment. Specific purposes are to:
(a)Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
(b)Prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water; prevent and
control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect
spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites,
placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and
scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
(c) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage
facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel
erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of
62
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream
property.
2. Intent. It is the intent of the City Council that this ordinance
regulates post-construction storm water discharges to waters of the
state. This ordinance may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The
City Council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of
achieving the storm water performance standards set forth in this
ordinance is through the preparation and implementation of
comprehensive, systems-level storm water management plans that cover
hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional
scale. Such plans may prescribe regional storm water devices,
practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from
more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where
such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed
under s. 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional storm water management
measures and have been approved by the City Council, it is the intent
of this ordinance that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction
management measures acceptable for the community.
D. Applicability and Jurisdiction.
1. Applicability.
(a) Where not otherwise limited by law, this ordinance applies to all
post-construction sites, unless the site is otherwise exempt under
D.1.(b).

a larger common plan of development or sale and that result in
less than 1 acre of disturbance.
(2) Non-point discharges from agricultural activity areas.
(3) Non-point discharges from silviculture activities.
(4) Mill and crush operations.
(c)Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in D.1.(a), this
ordinance applies to post-construction sites of any size that, in
the opinion of the Public Works Department, is likely to result in
runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage
facilities or receiving body of water, that causes undue channel
erosion, that increases water pollution by scouring or the
transportation of particulate matter or that endangers property or
public safety.

required to satisfy the performance standards within G.3.(a)(1)a.
and b.
(4) The amount of pollutant control previously required for the
site shall not be reduced as a result of the proposed development
or disturbance.
(5) When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from offsite
areas shall be taken into account in determining the treatment
efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the BMP efficiency
shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP
accordingly. The pollutant load reduction provided by the BMP
for an offsite area shall not be used to satisfy the required
onsite pollutant load reduction, unless otherwise approved by the
Public Works Department in accordance with G.5.
(6) If the design cannot meet the water quality performance
standards of G.3.(a)(1) through (5), the storm water management
plan shall include a written, site specific explanation of why
the water quality performance standard cannot be met and why the
pollutant load will be reduced only to the maximum extent
practicable. Except as provided in G.6., the Public Works
Department may not require any person to exceed the applicable
water quality performance standard to meet the requirements of
maximum extent practicable.
(b) Peak Discharge. BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained

for routine maintenance areas, unless runoff from the routine
maintenance area discharges into a proposed peak flow control
facility.
b. TR-55 methodology, Atlas 14 precipitation depths, and
the MSE4 distribution shall be used for peak discharge
calculations, unless the administering authority approves the
TP-40 precipitation depths and Type II distribution. The
meaning of “hydrologic soil group” and “runoff curve number”
are as determined in TR-55. Unless the site is currently

area shall not be used to satisfy the required onsite peak
discharge reduction, unless otherwise approved by the Public
Works Department in accordance with G.5.
(6)An adequate outfall shall be provided for each point of
concentrated discharge from the post-construction site. An
adequate outfall consists of non-erosive discharge velocities and
reasonable downstream conveyance.

infiltration volume shall be at least 75 percent of the pre-development
infiltration volume, based on an average annual
rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration
systems to meet this requirement, no more than 2 percent of the
post-construction site is required as an effective
infiltration area.
c. High imperviousness. For development with more than 80
percent connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip
malls, shopping centers, and commercial downtowns, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development
infiltration volume shall be at least 60 percent of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an average annual
rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration
systems to meet this requirement, no more than 2 percent of the
post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration
area.

Notwithstanding G.3.(c)(11), applicable requirements for
injection wells classified under ch. NR 815, Wis. Adm. Code,
shall be followed.
(12)Infiltration rate exemptions. Infiltration practices located in
the following areas may be credited toward meeting the requirement
under the following conditions, but the decision to infiltrate
under these conditions is optional:
a. Where the infiltration rate of the soil measured at the proposed
bottom of the infiltration system is less than 0.6 inches
per hour using a scientifically credible field test method.
b. Where the least permeable soil horizon to 5 feet below the
proposed bottom of the infiltration system using the U.S.
Department of Agriculture method of soils analysis is one of
the following: sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam,
sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.
(13)Alternate uses. Where alternate uses of runoff are employed,
such as for toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation or storage on
green roofs where an equivalent portion of the runoff is captured
permanently by rooftop vegetation, such alternate use shall be
given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by
G.3.(c).
(14)Groundwater standards.
a. Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this G.3.(c)
shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible,
minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater
and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit
at a point of standards application in accordance with ch. NR
140, Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site specific information
indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is
not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or
shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum
extent practicable.
b. Notwithstanding G.3.(c)(14)a., the discharge from BMPs shall
remain below the enforcement standard at the point of
standards application.
(15)Where the conditions of G.3.(c)(8) through (12) limit or

77
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
standard of G.3.(c) shall be met to the maximum extent
practicable.
(d) Protective Areas.
(1) “Protective area” means an area of land that commences at the
top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the
delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the
following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the
channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious
surface. However, in G.3.(d), “protective area” does not include
any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or
culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this
location. For post-construction sites with 1 acre or more of
land disturbance, the following is required:
a. For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource
waters, 75 feet.
b. For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a United
States geological survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or
a county soil survey map, whichever is more current, 50 feet.
c. For lakes, 50 feet.
d. For wetlands not subject to G.3.(d)(1)e. or f., 50 feet.
e. For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly susceptible
wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge
meadows, open and coniferous bogs, low prairies, coniferous
swamps, lowland hardwood swamps, and ephemeral ponds.
f. For less susceptible wetlands, 10 percent of the average
wetland width, but no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet.
Less susceptible wetlands include: degraded wetlands dominated
by invasive species such as reed canary grass; cultivated
hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or dredged material or fill
material disposal sites that take on the attributes of a
wetland.
g. In G.3.(d)(1)d. to f., determinations of the extent of the
protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the
basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the
wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in s. NR
103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
h. Wetlands shall be delineated. Wetland boundary delineations
shall be made in accordance with s. NR 103.08(1m), Wis. Adm.
Code. G.3.(d) does not apply to wetlands that have been
completely filled in compliance with all applicable state and
federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that
have been partially filled in compliance with all applicable
state and federal regulations shall be measured from the
wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed.
Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the
protective area standard need not be met in that location.
78
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
i. For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater
than 130 acres, 10 feet.
j. Notwithstanding G.3.(d)(1)a. to i., the greatest protective
area width shall apply where rivers, streams, lakes, and
wetlands are contiguous.
(2)G.3.(d) applies to all post-construction sites located within a
protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to
G.3.(d)(5).
(3) The following requirements shall be met:
a. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area
entirely or to the maximum extent practicable. If there is no
practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the
protective area, the storm water management plan shall contain
a written, site-specific explanation.
b. Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a
protective area, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative
cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and
maintained where no impervious surface is present. The
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be
sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish
habitat, and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland
flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative
materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as
necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where
high velocity flows occur.
c. Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or
wet detention ponds, that are designed to control pollutants
from non-point sources, may be located in the protective area.
(4) A protective area established or created after December 2, 2008
shall not be eliminated or reduced, except as allowed in
G.3.(d)(5)b., c., or d.
(5)Exemptions. The following areas are not required to meet the
protective area requirements of G.3.(d):
a. Redevelopment and routine maintenance areas provided the
minimum requirements within G.3.(d)(4) are satisfied.
b. Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat
landings, bridges and culverts.
c. Structures constructed in accordance with s. 59.692(1v), Wis.
Stats.
d. Areas of post-construction sites from which the
runoff does not enter the surface water, including wetlands,
without first being treated by a BMP to meet the requirements
of G.3.(a) and (b), except to the extent that vegetative
ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.
79
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
(e) Fueling and Vehicle Maintenance Areas. Fueling and vehicle
maintenance areas shall have BMPs designed, installed and maintained

maximum extent practicable.
(f) Swale Treatment for Transportation Facilities. This G.3.(f) is
not applicable to transportation facilities that are part of a
larger common plan of development or sale.
(1) Requirement. Except as provided in G.3.(f)(2), transportation
facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant
removal are exempt from the requirements of G.3.(a), (b), and
(c), if the swales are designed to do all of the following or to
the maximum extent practicable:
a. Swales shall be vegetated. However, where appropriate, nonvegetative
measures may be employed to prevent erosion or
provide for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap
stabilization or check dams.
b. Swales shall comply with the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources Technical Standard 1005, “Vegetated Infiltration
Swale”, except as otherwise authorized in writing by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
(2) Other Requirements. Notwithstanding G.3.(f)(1), the Public
Works Department may, consistent with water quality standards,
require that other requirements, in addition to swale treatment,
be met on a transportation facility with an average daily traffic
rate greater than 2,500 and where the initial surface water of
the state that the runoff directly enters is any of the
following:
a. An outstanding resource water.
b. An exceptional resource water.
c. Waters listed in section 303(d) of the federal clean water act
that are identified as impaired in whole or in part, due to
nonpoint source impacts.
d. Waters where targeted performance standards are developed
pursuant to s. NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
(g) Exemptions. The following areas are not required to meet the
performance standards within G.3.:
(1) Agricultural production areas with less than 100,000 square
feet of impervious surface disturbance.
(2) Underground utility construction such as water, sewer, gas,
electric, telephone, cable television, and fiber optic lines.

6.0604 Storm Water Utility
A. Establishment
The City of Marinette finds that the management of storm water
and other surface water discharge within and beyond the
Menominee River and Green Bay is a matter that affects the
health, safety and welfare of the City, its citizens and
businesses, and others in the surrounding area. Specific
requirements have been placed on the City through the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR)’s Regulation
216 requiring the City improve the quality of storm water
discharged to the waters of the State. The City shall be
permitted by the DNR and shall be required to remain in
compliance with their permit. This permit includes compliance
with the City’s Storm Water Management Plan. Failure to
effectively manage storm water affects the sanitary sewer
utility operations of the City by, among other things,
increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow in the
sanitary sewer. In addition, surface water runoff may create
erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences with
water damage, and create sedimentation and other environmental
damage in the Menominee River and Green Bay. Those elements of
the system that provide for the collection of and dispose of
storm water and regulation of groundwater are of benefit, and
provide services to all properties within the City of
Marinette, including property not presently served by the
storm elements of the system. The cost of operating and
maintaining the City storm water management system and
financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and
extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be
allocated in relationship to the benefits enjoyed and services
received therefrom.
There is hereby established a City of Marinette Storm Water
Utility. The operation of the Storm Water Utility shall be
under the supervision of the Board of Public Works. The
Director of Public Works/Engineer shall be in charge of the Storm
91
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
Water Utility.
B. Authority
The City, through the Storm Water Utility, may acquire,
construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand,
replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage and finance
such real estate and facilities as are deemed by the City to
be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of storm and
surface water management. These facilities may include,
without limitation by enumeration, surface and underground
drainage facilities, sewers, water courses, retaining walls
and ponds, detention basins, and such other facilities as will
support a storm water management system.

established pursuant to this Ordinance will be fair and reasonable in
accordance with the decision and judgment of the Board of Public Works.
The current rates will be on file with the City Clerk/Treasurer.
93
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
1. Rate charges shall be used to share the costs of the Storm Water
Utility. These rate charges may include:
(a) BASE CHARGE (BC). The Base Charge may be imposed on all
property in the City, EXCEPT UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY.
(Ordinance 2012-2221 adopted 4-4-2012). The Base Charge will be
designed to reflect the fact that all properties benefit
from the storm water management activities of the City and
that all property contribute in some way to the storm water
discharge that must be managed by the City. The BC will be
designed to collect the administrative costs of the storm
sewer utility and the portion of the capital costs not
covered by special assessment. The BC is equal to 0.7 ERU.
The BC may be based upon the size of a parcel of
property.(Ordinance 2012-2221 adopted 4-4-2012)
(b) EQUIVALENT RUNOFF UNIT CHARGE (ERU). This charge
shall be imposed on all property that has any developed
impervious area. The ERU will be designed on the basis of a
typical residential unit of property. Other units of
property will be charged multiples of the ERU, based upon
the impervious area contributing to surface water runoff.
(c) SPECIAL CHARGE (SC). This charge may be imposed on
property that is in an area specially benefited by a
particular storm water management facility. The SC will be
developed to reflect the benefits/services in a particular
area that may not be appropriate to spread to property
throughout the City. The SC will be calculated on an ERU
basis.
E. Collection Agency
The City of Marinette is hereby appointed as the collection
agency for the City Storm Water Utility. Bills shall be prepared
by the City or its agent and sent to the Owner of each premise
served. The City shall allocate the actual cost of billing and
collecting.
1. The bills for Storm Water Utility charges shall be mailed
to the Owner of the property.
2. Storm Water Utility charges shall not be payable in
installments. If Storm Water Utility charges remain unpaid
after a period of 20-days from the date of the utility
bill, such bill shall become delinquent.
3. Unpaid and/or delinquent charges shall be assessed the same
as the water utility bills.
F. Customer Classification
For purposes of imposing the storm water charges, all lots and
parcels within the City are classified into the following six (6)
customer classes:
1. Residential - Single-Family.
94
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
2. Residential - Duplex.
3. Residential - Multi-Family and Condominium.
4. Non-Residential
5. Undeveloped.
6. City Owned.
G. The Director of Public Works shall prepare a list of lots and
parcels within the City of Marinette, and assign a classification
of residential, nonresidential or undeveloped to each lot or
parcel.
1. The average square footage of impervious area of the ERU is
established to be equivalent to 3,105-square feet.
2. The charges imposed for single-family residential
properties shall be the rate for one ERU.
3. The charges imposed for duplex residential properties shall
be the rate for one ERU.
4. The charges imposed for multi-family and condominium
residential properties shall be the same as non-residential
properties (refer to Section 508).
H. No charges shall be imposed for City-owned property. No charges
shall be imposed for undeveloped property. (Ordinance 2012-2221
adopted 4-4-2012)
I. The charges imposed for non-residential properties, as defined
herein, shall be the rate for one (1) ERU, multiplied by the
numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area
of a non-residential property by the square footage of one (1)
ERU. The factor shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10th,
i.e.:
(ERU Rate) (Impervious Area in Square Feet)
3,105 square feet
e.g. 10,000 square feet = 3.2 ERU’s
3,105 square feet
J. Impervious Surface Determination
The Director of Public Works shall be responsible for determining
the impervious area, based upon the best available information,
including, but not limited to, data supplied by the Building
Inspector, aerial photography, the Property Owner, Tenant or
Developer. The Director of Public Works may require additional
information, as necessary, to make the determination. The billing
amount shall be updated by the Director of Public Works on any
additions to the impervious area. Upon Property Owner’s written
notification and request, the Director of Public Works shall
review impervious area for possible reductions.
K. The minimum charges for any developed parcel shall be equal to
95
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
the BC rate.
L. New Construction
The Owner shall also be liable for storm water charges under this
Ordinance for the improvement from the date of water meter
installation or upon review of the actual impervious area by
January 1st.
M. Method of Appeal
The Storm Water Utility charge may be appealed, as follows:
1. A written challenge to the storm water charge must be filed
with the Director of Public Works on behalf of the customer,
specifying all basis for the challenge and the amount of the
storm water charge the customer asserts is appropriate.
Failure to file a challenge within 30days of payment waives
all right to later challenge the charge.
2. A property owner not satisfied with the Director of Public
Works’ decision can appeal to the Board of Public Works for
their review and action.
3. Following review by the Director of Public Works, the Board of
Public Works will determine whether the storm water charge is
fair and reasonable, or whether a refund is due the customer.
The Board of Public Works may act with or without a hearing,
and will inform the customer in writing of its decision.
4. If the Board of Public Works determines that a refund is due
the customer, the refund will be applied as a credit on the
customer’s next storm water billing, if the refund will not
exceed the customer’s next storm water billing or will be
refunded at the discretion of the Board of Public Works
without interest.
N. Special Assessment Authority
In addition to any other method for collection of the charges
established pursuant to this Ordinance for storm water utility
costs, the Common Council finds that these charges may be levied
on property as a special charge pursuant to s. 66.0627, Wis.
Stats. The charges established hereunder reasonably reflect the
benefits conferred on property and may be assessed as special
charges. The billing for such charges to the owner will serve as
notice to the owner that failure to pay the charges when due may
result in them being charged pursuant to the authority of s.
66.0627, Wis. Stats. In addition, the City may provide notice
each October of any unpaid charges to the Storm Water Utility,
which charges, if not paid by November 15, may be placed on the
tax roll under s. 66.0627, Wis. Stats.
O. Budget Excess Revenues
The Storm Water Utility finances shall be accounted for in a
separate Storm Water Management Fund by the City. The Utility
96
City of Marinette Code of Ordinances
shall prepare an annual budget, which is to include all operation
and maintenance costs, administrative costs, depreciation costs,
debt service and other costs related to the operation of the
Storm Water utility. The budget is subject to approval by the
Board of Public Works. The costs shall be spread over the rate
classifications as determined by the Board of Public Works. Any
excess of revenues over expenditures in a year will be retained
by the Storm Water Management Fund for subsequent years’ needs.
P. Effective Date
This ordinance shall take effect January 1, 2010.

CHAPTER 7: PUBLIC UTILITIES
7.0100 WATER UTILITY
Article A Rules and Regulations
7.0101 COMPLIANCE WITH RULES
All persons now receiving a water supply from the Marinette Water Utility, or
who may request service in the future, shall be considered as having agreed to be
bound by the rules and regulations as filed with the Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin.
7.0102 ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE
A. Application for water service shall be made in writing on a form furnished
by the Water Utility. The application will contain the legal description of
the property to be served, name of the owner, the exact use to be made of
the service, and the size of the service lateral and meter desired. (Note
particularly any special refrigeration, fire protection, or water consuming
air-conditioning equipment)
B. Service will be furnished only if:
1. Premises have a frontage on a properly platted street or public strip in
which a cast iron or other long-life water main has been laid, or where
property owner has agreed to, and complied with, the provisions of
the Utility's filed main extension rule,
2. Property owner has installed or agrees to install a service lateral from
the curb line to the point of use, that is laid not less than six (6) feet
below the surface of an established or proposed grade, and according
to Utility's specification, and
3. Premises have adequate piping beyond metering point.
C. The owner of a multi-unit dwelling has the option of being served by
individual metered water service to each unit. The owner, by selecting this
option, is required to provide interior plumbing and meter settings to enable
individual metered service to each unit and individual disconnection
without affecting service to other units. Each meter and meter connection
will be a separate water utility account for the purpose of the filed rules and
regulations.
D. No division of the water service of any lot or parcel of land shall be made
for the extension and independent metering of the supply to an adjoining lot
or parcel of land. Except for duplexes, no division of a water supply service
lateral shall be made at the curb for separate supplies therefrom for two (2)
or more separate premises having frontage on any street or public service
strip whether owned by the same or different parties. Duplexes may be
City of Marinette 7-2 Code of Ordinances
served by one lateral, provided that: (1) individual metered service and
disconnection is provided, and (2) it is permitted by local ordinance.
E. No applicant property owner may connect a private watermain to a public
watermain without first submitting to the Water Utility a copy of the plans
and the Department of Safety and Professional Services approval for the
proposed project.
F. The Utility is hereby empowered to withhold approval of any application
wherein full information of the purpose of such supply is not clearly
indicated and set forth by the applicant property owner.
G. Buildings used in the same business, located on the same parcel, and served
by a single lateral may have the customer’s water supply piping installed to
a central point so that volume can be metered in one place.
7.0103 SERVICE CONTRACT
A. The minimum service contract period shall be one (1) year unless otherwise
specified by special contract or in the applicable rate schedule. Where a
customer, at his request, has been disconnected (meter removed) prior to
expiration of his minimum contract period and his account is not
delinquent, and where thereafter he requests the reconnection of service in
the same or other location, a reconnection charge payable in advance, shall
be collected. (See PSC Schedule R-1 for applicable rate.) The minimum
contract period is renewed with each reconnection.
B. A reconnection charge shall also be required from the customers whose
services are disconnected (shut off at curb stop) because of nonpayment of
bills when due, (not including disconnection for failure to comply with
deposit or guarantee rules). (See PSC Schedule R-1 for applicable rate.)
C. A customer shall be considered as the same customer provided the
reconnection is requested for the same location by any member of the same
family, or if a place of business, by any partner or employee of the same
business.
7.0104 TEMPORARY METERED SUPPLY; METER AND DEPOSITS
An applicant for temporary water supply on a metered basis shall make and
maintain a monetary deposit for each meter installed, as security for payment for
use of water and for such other charges which may arise from the use of the
supply. A charge shall be made for setting the valve and furnishing and setting the
meter. See PSC Schedule BW-1 for the applicable rate.
7.0105 WATER FOR CONSTRUCTION
A. When water is requested for construction purposes, or for filling tanks or
other such uses, an application shall be made to the Utility, in writing, upon
application provided for that purpose by the Utility, giving an estimate of
the amount of construction work to be done, or the size of the tank to be
filled, etc. Payment for the water for construction shall be made in advance
City of Marinette 7-3 Code of Ordinances
at the scheduled rates. The service pipe must be installed inside the building
from where the water must be drawn. No connection with the service pipe
at the curb shall be made without special permission from the Utility.
B. In no case will any employee of the Utility turn on water for construction
work unless the contractor first presents a permit. Upon completion of the
construction work, the contractor must return the original permit to the
Water Utility, together with a statement of the actual amount of
construction work performed/water used.
C. Customers shall not allow contractors, masons, or other persons to take
unmetered water from their premises without permission from the Utility.
Any consumer failing to comply with this provision will have water service
discontinued and will be responsible for the cost of the estimated volume of
water used.
7.0106 USE OF HYDRANTS
A. In cases where no other supply is available, permission may be granted by
the Utility to use a hydrant. No hydrant (public or private) shall be used for
other than fire-fighting purposes until the proper permit has been issued,
and the proper meter and valve are installed. In no case shall any valve be
installed or moved except by an employee of the Utility, or a Utilityapproved
party.
B. Before a valve is set, payment must be made for its setting and for the water
to be used at the scheduled rates. See PSC Schedule BW-1 for deposits and
charges. Upon completing the use of the hydrant, the customer must notify
the Water Utility to that effect.
7.0107 OPERATION OF VALVES AND HYDRANTS; UNAUTHORIZED USE OF
WATER
A. Any person who shall, without authority of the Utility, allow contractors,
masons, or other unauthorized persons to take unmetered water from their
premises, operate any valve connected with the street or supply mains, or
open any fire hydrant (public or private) connected with the distribution
system, except for the purpose of extinguishing fire (or reasonable firefighting
training exercises), or who shall wantonly damage or impair the
same shall be subject to a fine as provided by City Ordinance. Utility
permission for the use of hydrants apply only to such hydrants as are
designated for the specific use and only for the timeframe specified by the
Utility.
B. First Offense – Penalty. Any person who shall violate any provision of this
section shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit Three Hundred Dollars
($300.00) together with the costs of prosecution, and in default of payment
of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution, shall be imprisoned in the
County Jail until such forfeiture and costs are paid, but not exceeding ninety
(90) days.
City of Marinette 7-4 Code of Ordinances
C. Second and Subsequent Offense(s). Each violation shall constitute a
separate offense, and shall be dealt with according to the procedures set
forth in Section 1.0107, Code of Ordinances, City of Marinette, Wisconsin.
7.0108 REFUNDS OF MONETARY DEPOSITS
All monies deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the use of
temporary water supply on a metered basis, or for the return of a hydrant valve
and fixtures, if the water is used on an un-metered basis, will be refunded to the
depositor on the termination of the use of water, the payment of all charges levied
against the depositor, and the return of the Utility’s equipment.
7.0109 SERVICE CONNECTIONS (OR WATER LATERALS)
A. No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish,
rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to, or
disintegration of, the service pipe, unless adequate means of protection are
provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by the
Utility. Service pipes passing through curb or retaining walls shall be
adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing, not
less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space between
the service pipe and channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly
caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material, and made
impervious to moisture.
B. In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against
injury by carefully hand tamping clean granular backfill around the pipe.
There shall be at least six (6) inches of clean granular backfill free from
hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material over the pipe.
C. All water service laterals shall be of undiminished size from the street main
in to the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve the piping
shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an
equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number of
fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously.
7.0110 REPLACEMENT AND REPAIR OF SERVICE PIPE
A. The service pipe from the main to and through the curb stop will be
maintained and kept in repair and when worn out, replaced at the expense of
the Utility. The property owner shall maintain the service pipe from the
curb stop to the point of use.
B. If an owner fails to repair a leaking or broken service pipe from curb to
point of metering or use within such time as may appear reasonable to the
Utility after notification has been served on the owner by the Utility, the
water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs have
been completed.
C. If a property owner changes the use of a property currently receiving water
service such that water service will no longer be needed in the future, the
City of Marinette 7-5 Code of Ordinances
Water Utility may require the abandonment of the water service at the water
main. In such case the property owner may be responsible for all removal
and/or repair costs, including the water main and the Utility portion of the
water service lateral.
7.0111 CHARGES FOR WATER WASTED DUE TO LEAKS
See Wis. Adm. Code, Chapter PSC 185.35, which is hereby adopted by reference.
7.0112 THAWING FROZEN SERVICES
See Wis. Adm. Code, Chapter PSC 185.88, which is hereby adopted by reference.
7.0113 STOP BOXES
The curb stop box is the property of the Water Utility. The Utility is responsible
for its repair and maintenance. This includes maintaining, through adjustment, the
curb stop box at an appropriate grade level where no direct action by the property
owner or occupant has contributed to an elevation problem. The property owner is
responsible for protecting the curb stop box from situations that could obstruct
access to it or unduly expose it to harm. The Utility shall not be liable for failure
to locate the stop box and shut off the water in case of a leak on the consumer’s
premises.
7.0114 INSTALLATION OF METERS
A. Meters will be owned, furnished and/or installed by the Utility or a Utilityapproved
contractor and are not to be disconnected or tampered with by the
customer without prior written approval of the Utility.
B. All meters shall be so located that they shall be protected from obstructions
and permit ready access thereto for reading, inspection, and servicing; such
location to be designated or approved by the Administrator as provided in
Section 7.0116.
C. All piping within the building must be supplied by the consumer. Where
additional meters are desired by the consumer, he shall pay for all piping
and an additional amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance and
depreciation, but not less than twenty-five cents ($ 0.25) per month.
7.0115 REPAIRS TO METERS
A. Meters will be repaired by the Water Utility and the cost of such repairs
caused by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the Utility.
B. Repair of any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the
owner of the premises, his agent, or tenant, or from the negligence of any
one of them to properly secure and protect same, including any damage that
may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be injured
from the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by
the consumer or the owner of the premises.
City of Marinette 7-6 Code of Ordinances
7.0116 SERVICE PIPING FOR METER SETTINGS
A. In cases where a new customer whose service is to be metered installs the
original service piping or where an existing metered customer changes his
service piping for his own convenience, or where an existing flat rate
customer requests to be metered, the customer shall, at his expense, provide
a suitable location and the proper connections for the meter. The
Superintendent’s approval as to the type, size and location of meter setting
is required.
B. Where it is possible to set meters in an accessible basement (meeting OSHA
entry/egress requirements), or other suitable place within the building, the
installed service piping shall incorporate the proper meter spacer and
couplings (available at the Water Utility office). Valves shall be installed
within twelve inches before and after the meter. Piping shall be installed in
such a manner as to support the meter in a horizontal position, and be
flexible enough to allow easy removal of the spacer and insertion of the
meter.
C. Where the meter must be located in a space other than an accessible
basement (meeting OSHA entry/egress requirements) the meter spacer and
couplings (available at the Water Utility office) shall be installed within
twelve inches of an access door or panel with a minimum size of sixteen
inches high by twenty-four inches wide. Valves shall be installed within
twelve inches before and after the meter. Piping shall be installed in such a
manner as to support the meter in a horizontal position, and be flexible
enough to allow easy removal of the spacer, and insertion of the meter. The
access door or panel must be readily accessible and easily opened or
removed. If in an unheated space, water lines are to be heat traced and
meters are to be insulated with a pre-cast polystyrene jacket (no fiberglass
insulation is permitted on the meter). If a meter jacket is not provided by the
homeowner at the time of meter installation the water utility will provide
one and bill the homeowner for the cost. (An illustrative drawing for the
above is available from the Water Utility office.)
D. No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service.
7.0117 TURNING ON WATER
The water may only be turned on for a customer by a duly authorized employee or
representative of the Utility. Plumbers may turn the water on to test their work,
but upon completion must leave the water turned off.
7.0118 FAILURE TO READ METERS
A. Where the Utility is unable to read a meter, the fact will be plainly indicated
on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or the minimum
charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again
read, that is, the bill for the succeeding billing period will be computed with
the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and
City of Marinette 7-7 Code of Ordinances
credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the bill paid the preceding
period. Only in unusual cases, shall more than three (3) consecutive
estimated or minimum bills be rendered.
B. If the meter is damaged (see Surreptitious Use of Water) or fails to operate,
the bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless there is
some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be
properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method.
See Wis. Admin. Code Chapter PSC 185.33.
7.0119 COMPLAINT METER TESTS
See Wis. Adm. Code PSC Sections 185.77 which is hereby adopted by reference.
7.0120 INSPECTION OF PREMISES
During reasonable hours any officer or authorized employee of the Utility shall
have the right of access to the premises supplied with service, for the purpose of
inspection or for the enforcement of the Utility's rules and regulations. Whenever
appropriate the Utility will make a systematic inspection of all un-metered water
taps for the purpose of checking waste and unnecessary use of water.

7.0129 ANNEXATION REQUIRED PRIOR TO NEW WATER CONNECTION
No property outside of the corporate boundaries of the city may be connected as a
new Marinette Municipal Water System customer unless that property has been
annexed into the City of Marinette prior to the connection. In the event of
inadvertent or mistaken connection of such a property without its annexation,
upon the discovery of this fact, the Utility shall provide notice to the property
owner that the owner has ninety (90) days within which to annex. If annexation
does not occur within ninety (90) days of the notice, the service shall be
immediately disconnected.

7.0151 PURITY OF SUPPLY NOT TO BE IMPAIRED BY CROSS
CONNECTIONS
(1) Definitions:
Backflow — The undesirable flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, solids
gases or other substances under positive or reduced pressure into the Marinette Water
Utility (hereinafter “Utility”) potable supply of water from any source.
Backflow Preventer — A device or means designed to prevent backflow caused by
backpressure or backsiphonage; most commonly categorized as air gap, reduced pressure
principle backflow assembly, double check valve assembly, pressure vacuum breaker
assembly, backsiphonage backflow vacuum breaker (spill resistant pressure vacuum
breaker) assembly, pipe applied atmospheric vacuum breaker, flush tank ballcock,
City of Marinette 7-11 Code of Ordinances
laboratory faucet backflow preventer, backflow preventer for carbonated beverage
machine, vacuum breaker wall hydrants, chemical dispensing machine, hose connection
vacuum breaker, hose connection backflow preventer, backflow preventer with
intermediate atmospheric vent and barometric loop.
Backpressure — An elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system (pump
elevation of piping, or steam and/or air pressure) above the utility supply pressure, which
would cause or tend a reversal of the normal direction of flow.
Back-Siphonage — The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the
distribution pipes of the Utility’s potable water supply system from any source caused by
the sudden reduction of pressure in the Utility’s potable water supply system.
Cross Connection — Any physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise
separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the Utility, and the other
containing water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or
steam, gases, or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other,
the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.
(2) Purity of supply not to be impaired by cross connections
(a) No person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be established or maintain
or permit to be maintained any cross connection. No interconnection shall be established
whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply, other than
the regular public water supply provided by the Utility, may enter the supply or
distribution system of the Utility, unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water
supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by
the Utility and the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
(b) Inspections — It shall be the duty of the Utility to cause inspection to be made of all
properties serviced by the Utility where cross connection with the public water system is
deemed possible.
Residential properties serviced by the Utility shall be inspected on a twenty-year interval.
All non-residential properties serviced by the Utility shall be inspected on a two-year, six
year, ten year and twenty year intervals based on hazard level. The Utility may, but is not
required to, perform the cross connection inspection of the owner’s property. If, in the
opinion of the Utility, the Utility is not able to perform the inspection, the property owner
must, at their own expense, have the plumbing inspected for cross connections by a State
of Wisconsin Certified Cross Connection Inspector or by a State of Wisconsin licensed
plumber. The frequency of required inspections and re-inspections, based on potential
health hazards involved, may be shortened by the Utility. The Utility may charge fees as
approved by the State of Wisconsin Public Service Commission for on-premises followup
visits by Utility personnel for re-inspection due to customer non-compliance and for
after hours inspections or re-inspections.
City of Marinette 7-12 Code of Ordinances
(c) Right of Entry — Upon presentation of credentials, representatives of the Utility shall
have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any property served by a
connection to the public water system of the Utility for cross connection. If entry is
refused, such representatives shall obtain a special inspection warrant under Chapter
66.0119, of the Wis. Stats. Upon request, the owner, lesser, or occupant of any property
so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the
piping system or systems on such property.
(d) Authority to Discontinue Service — The Utility is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this
article exists and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to
eliminate any damage of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be
discontinued if the means of backflow prevention required by the Utility is not installed,
tested, maintained, and repaired in compliance with this article and Wisconsin
Administrative Code NR 811, or if it is found that the means of backflow prevention
required by this article has been removed or bypassed. Water service shall be
discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68,
Wisconsin Statutes, except as provided in §7-1-51(2)(f) below.
(e) Reconnection of Service — Water service to any property discontinued under the
provisions of this article shall not be restored until the cross connection has been
eliminated or a backflow prevention device approved by the Utility has been installed in
compliance with the provisions of this article. The Utility shall charge fees as approved
by the State of Wisconsin Public Service Commission for the reconnection of the water
service.
(f) Emergency Discontinuance of Service — If it is determined by the Utility that a cross
connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires
immediate action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the Clerk of the City of
Marinette and delivered to the customer’s premises, service may be immediately
discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68,
Wisconsin Statutes, within ten days of such emergency discontinuance.
(g) Owner Responsibility — The property owner shall be responsible for the elimination
of, or protection from all cross connections on their premises. The property owner shall,
at his or her expense, have installed, maintained, and tested any and all backflow
preventers on his or her premises in compliance with Wisconsin Administrative Code NR
811 and Department of Safety and Professional Services Chapter 82. The property owner
shall have corrected any malfunction, revealed by periodic testing, of any backflow
preventer on their premises. The property owner shall inform the Utility of any proposed
or modified cross connections and also any existing cross connection that are not
protected by an approved backflow prevention device. The property owner shall not
install a by-pass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of
the same type on the by-pass. Property owners who cannot shut down operation for
testing of the backflow prevention device must supply additional devices necessary to
City of Marinette 7-13 Code of Ordinances
allow testing to take place. In the event the property owner installs plumbing upstream of
the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer. The
property owner is required to follow the protection practices described in the American
Water Works Association publication AWWA M14 titled “Recommended Practice for
Backflow Prevention and Cross Connection Control”, unless the Utility requires or
authorizes other means of protecting the public water system. These requirements or
authorizations will be at the discretion of the Utility.
(h) Additional Protection — In the case of premises having (a) internal cross connections
that can not be permanently corrected or controlled, or (b) intricate plumbing and piping
arrangements where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for
inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not
dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against
backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service
line. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is
handled in such a manner that, in the opinion of the Utility, could create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by
an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
preventer. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage
treatment plants, hospitals, plating plants, and car wash establishments. In the case of any
premises where, in the opinion of the Utility, an undue health threat is posed because of
the presence of toxic substances, the Utility may require an approved air gap at the
service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the
discretion of the Utility.
(3) Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 811 is hereby adopted by reference. This section does
not supersede the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Administrative Code NR
811, but is supplementary to it.
(4) The Wisconsin Uniform Plumbing Code Safety and Professional Services Chapters 382-384
of the Wisconsin Administrative Code is hereby adopted by reference. This section does not
supersede the Wisconsin Uniform Plumbing Code or the City of Marinette Plumbing Code, but

A. Where the cost of the extension is to be collected through assessment
against the abutting property, the procedure set forth under Section 66.0703
of the Wisconsin Statutes will apply, and no additional customer
contributions to the Water Utility will be required.
B. Where the City is unwilling or unable to make a special assessment, the
extension will be made on a customer-financed basis as follows:
1. The applicant(s) will advance as a contribution in aid of construction
the total amount equivalent to that which would have been assessed
for all property under (a).
2. Part of the contribution required in Subsection (1) will be refundable.
When additional customers are connected to the extended main within
ten (10) years of the date of completion, contributions in aid of
construction will be collected equal to the amount which would have
been assessed under (a) for the abutting property being served. This
amount will be refunded to the original contributor(s). In no case will
the contributions received from additional customers exceed the
proportionate amount which would have been required under (a), nor
will it exceed the total assessable cost of the original extension.
C. When a customer connects to a transmission main or connecting loop
installed at utility expense within 10 years of the date of completion, there
will be a contribution required of an amount equivalent to that which would
have been assessed under A (Ordinance 2011-2181 adopted 1-4-11).

resources, which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence
of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
B. Bypass Not Violating Applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements.
An industrial User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standard or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
City of Marinette 7-40 Code of Ordinances
C. Notice.
1. If an Industrial User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it

ten days before the date of the bypass.
2. An Industrial User shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass
that exceed applicable Pretreatment Standards to the Control
Authority within 24 hours from the time the Industrial User becomes
aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided
within 5 days of the time the Industrial User becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated
time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Control
Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D. Prohibition of Bypass
1. Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take enforcement
action against an Industrial User for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods or equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment
should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtimes or preventative
maintenance; and
(c) The Industrial User submitted notices as required under
paragraph (C) of this section.
2. The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effect, if the Control Authority determines that
it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)(1) of this
section.

deadlines will comply with CFR 403.6(b).
E. Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR). The BMR is a report submitted by
industrial users, where NCPS are applicable, to the Control Authority. The
contents of the BMR (detailed in Section 7.02144(F)) sets up the basis or a
"baseline" from which the Control Authority determines industrial
compliance with an NCPS. The information is also used to calculate
pollutant loadings and may provide the basis for limitations in a wastewater
discharge permit. All Baseline Monitoring Reports shall be filed with the
Control Authority as follows:
1. Dischargers who were required under law to file a BMR with
agencies of the Federal or State government, shall, within thirty days
following the effective date of this Ordinance, file a BMR with the
Control Authority.
2. Dischargers who were required under law to file a BMR within 180
days after the effective date of a newly enacted NCPS or within 180
days after the final administrative decision made upon a category
determination submittal under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), shall file a BMR
with the Control Authority. When the 180 days has elapsed without a
BMR submittal to the Control Authority, the Control Authority will
start enforcement procedures. For newly-enacted NCPSs, a BMR
shall be submitted to the Control Authority within 180 days of the
effect date of the new NCPS or final administrative decision.
F. Content of BMR. A BMR shall be on a form provided by the Control
Authority and shall contain the following information:
1. Identifying Information. The name and address of the discharger from
which there will be a discharge of wastewater into the wastewater
collection facilities, the names of the persons who own and operate
the discharger's premises, and the name and phone number of the

shall be representative of daily operations. Sampling and analysis
shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(b)(5).
6. Certification. A statement, reviewed and signed by an authorized
representative of the discharger and certified to by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards and
requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment
is required for the discharger to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements.
G. Compliance Date Report. A final compliance report shall be submitted to
the Control Authority within ninety days following the final compliance
date as established by a Wastewater Discharge Permit or an NCPS. The
report shall indicate the constituents and characteristics of all regulated
waste streams covered by the Wastewater Discharge Permit or an applicable
NCPS, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons of its
wastewater discharged to the wastewater collection facilities. The report
shall also state whether the applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements have been and are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
what additional operation and/or maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. This statement shall be signed by

9.0229 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT FOR RECIPIENTS OF INTITIAL
ISSUANCE OF RESERVE “CLASS B” INTOXICATING LIQUOR
LICENSES
A. Findings and Purpose
The Common Council finds that businesses such as restaurants, hotels and
taverns make important contributions to the City’s economy. These
establishments serve important public purposes including increasing the
City’s property tax base, providing employment and promoting tourism.
Excessive license fees deter new businesses and are contrary to these
public purposes. 1997 Wisconsin Act 27 requires municipalities to
establish a minimum fee of $10,000.00 for each initial reserve “Class B”
liquor license issued. Since the new fee far exceeds the actual cost of
licensing the activity, additional revenue will be available to the City. It is
the purpose of this ordinance to utilize revenue generated by Wisconsin
Act 27 to assist new reserve “Class B” licensees achieve the important
public purposes identified.
B. Economic Grant
Following the initial issuance of a reserve “Class B” liquor license and
upon application by the licensee, the Common Council may provide a
grant to the licensee in an amount not to exceed $9,550.00. Prior to
awarding any grant, the Common Council shall make such findings and
establish such conditions to ensure that any funds awarded further the
important public purposes identified above.
Article C Penalties
9.0230 PENALTIES
A. Forfeitures for violations of Sections 125.07(1)-(5) and 125.09(2) of the
Wisconsin Statutes, adopted by reference in Section 9.0201 of the Code of
Ordinances of the City of Marinette, Wisconsin, shall conform to the
forfeiture penalty permitted to be imposed for violations of the comparable

for which a license is required without such license, shall be subject to a

City of Marinette 13 Code of Ordinances
Article D Alcoholic Beverages in Adult Establishments
WHEREAS, based on evidence concerning the secondary effects of adult establishments on the
community in reports made available to the City of Marinette, and on the holdings and findings
in cases such as City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925 (1986);
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111 S.Ct. 2456 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M.,
529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000); Ben’s Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702 (7th
Cir. 2003) as well as studies and summaries of studies conducted in other cities, including, but
not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona, Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles,
California; Whittier, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Ellicottville,
New York; New York City, New York; Times Square, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Cleburne, Texas, Dallas,
Texas, Houston, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Newport News, Virginia; St. Croix County,
Wisconsin; and the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the Regulation of
Sexually Oriented Businesses (Minnesota, June 6, 1989), the Common Council of the City of
Marinette finds that adult establishments may and do generate secondary effects, which the
Common Council believes are detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
These secondary effects, include, but are not limited to:
1. Greater frequency, as shown by crime statistics, of all types of crimes, especially
prostitution, other sex-related crimes and controlled substance crimes in neighborhoods
where adult establishments are located, particularly when located in proximity to each
other, as well as to businesses serving alcohol, which thus requires increased supervision
from public safety agencies of local governments;
2. Increased urban blight and decay as other business and residents move out of the vicinity
as they perceive adult establishments as an indication that the area is deteriorating;
3. Decreased property values on both residential and commercial properties, which harm the
economic welfare of communities and negatively affect the overall quality of life;
4. Increased public health risks through the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; and
5. Increased potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct;
WHEREAS, the Common Council finds, based on these studies and judicial decisions such
as Ben’s Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702 (7th Cir. 2003), that the consumption of
alcoholic beverages on the premises of an adult establishment exacerbates the deleterious
secondary effects of such businesses on the community;
WHEREAS, the Common Council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary
effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizenry, preserve the
quality of life, protect citizens from increased crime, preserve the property values and character
of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight;
WHEREAS, the Common Council finds that some of the activities described herein are
protected as expression under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, recognizes
that such rights are among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act
consistently with full protection of those rights;
City of Marinette 14 Code of Ordinances
WHEREAS, it is not the purpose of this ordinance or the Common Council to suppress any
speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but instead to enact a content-neutral
ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult establishments;
WHEREAS, the Common Council recognizes that it lacks authority to regulate obscenity
pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 66.0107(3) and does not intend by adopting this ordinance to regulate
obscenity, but instead only intends and declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the
secondary effects of adult establishments;
WHEREAS, it is also not the intent of the Common Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material since the Common Council recognizes that state and federal law
prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement
officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in the City of
Marinette;
WHEREAS, the Common Council has authority under its general police powers as provided
under Wis. Stat. § 62.11(5) to act for the good order of the City and for the health, safety and
general welfare of the public and may carry out its powers by regulation and suppression;
WHEREAS, the Common Council has the authority to prescribe additional regulations for
the sale of alcohol beverages under Wis. Stat. § 125.10(1) that are not in conflict with Chapter
125 of the Wisconsin Statutes;
WHEREAS, the Common Council finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the City;
NOW, THEREFORE, the Common Council of the City of Marinette, do ordain as follows:
Section 1. Marinette Municipal Code Section 9-2-35 is created as follows:
(a) PURPOSE. It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City of Marinette, preserve the quality of life and
neighborhood characteristics, prevent adverse and deleterious effects that contribute to
blight and downgrading of neighborhoods, prevent criminal activity and disruption of the
public peace and maintain property values. It is not the purpose or intent of this
ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to materials protected by the First
Amendment, nor to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment
to their intended market. It is neither the purpose nor intent to impose limitations or
restrictions on the content of any communicative materials or messages. By enactment of
this ordinance, the Common Council does not intend to give any explicit, implicit or tacit
approval or condone any activity relating to adult establishments. Further, it is not the
intent of this ordinance to permit any use or act, which is otherwise prohibited or made
punishable by law.
City of Marinette 15 Code of Ordinances

§ 1 PURPOSE:
This Chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children
in Marinette from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to

threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much
more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual
assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity
and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a need to protect
children at schools and day care centers.

The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote the health, safety, morals, prosperity,
aesthetics, and general welfare of the City of Marinette.
13.0103 Intent
It is the general intent of this Ordinance to regulate and restrict the use of all
structures, lands, and waters; regulate and restrict lot coverage, population
distribution, and density; and regulate and restrict size and location of all
structures so as to: lessen congestion in and promote the safety and efficiency of

avoid undue concentration of population; facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements;
provide adequate light and air, including access to sunlight for solar collectors,
and wind for wind energy systems; encourage the protection of ground water,
stabilize and protect property values; further the appropriate use of land and
conservation of natural resources; preserve and promote the beauty of the
community; and implement the community's comprehensive plan or plan
components. To this end, it is further intended to provide for the administration
and enforcement of this Ordinance and to provide penalties for its violation.
13.0200 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
It is not intended by these zoning regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or
interfere with any existing easements, covenants or agreements between parties or
with any rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to
laws; provided, however, that where these zoning regulations impose a greater
restriction upon the use of buildings or premises, or upon the height of a building
or require larger open spaces than are required by other rules, regulations or
permits or by easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of these zoning
regulations shall govern.
13.0300 INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be
held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the

13.1900 RC - RESIDENTIAL CLUSTER DISTRICT
Also known as a “conservation subdivision” the RC – Residential Cluster District
is designed as a mapped district to be applied to parcels of ten (10) acres or larger.
The ordinance requires clustering of residential development within the district in
order to preserve a minimum of 60 percent of the site as common open space.
13.01901 Purpose
The purpose of the RC – Residential Cluster District is to preserve and protect
valuable, non-renewable and diminishing natural resources by clustering
City of Marinette 35 Code of Ordinances
residential dwellings at greater densities than are allowed in typical residential
districts.
13.01902 Intent
The purpose of the RC - Residential Cluster District is to preserve open space,
rural landscape character, natural resource areas, and to lessen the impact of
development on existing natural resources such as wetlands, while permitting
residential development at higher densities, in an open space setting, located and
designed to reduce the perceived intensity of development and provide privacy for
dwellings. Specific objectives are as follows:
A. To maintain and protect valuable natural resources by preserving important landscape
elements, including those areas containing unique and environmentally sensitive natural
features such as woodlands, hedgerows, stream corridors, wetlands, floodplains, shorelands,
prairies, ridge tops, steep slopes, critical species habitat, and natural areas by setting them aside
from development. Such areas contained in primary environmental corridors, as identified by
the Bay-Lake Regional Planning Commission, are of particular significance for conservation.
B. To preserve scenic views and to minimize views of new development from existing
streets.
C. To provide for the unified and planned development of parcels ten (10) acres or larger
in size for clustered, single-family, higher density residential uses, incorporating large areas of
permanently protected common open space.
D. To provide for greater design flexibility in the siting of dwellings and other
development features than would be permitted by the application of standard district regulations
in order to minimize the disturbance of rural landscape elements, scenic quality, and overall
aesthetic value of the landscape.
E. To increase flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure, by
reducing street length, utility requirements, drainage requirements, and the amount of paving
required for residential development, where possible.
F. To create groups of dwellings with direct visual and physical access to common open
space.
G. To permit active and passive recreational use of common open space by residents of a
cluster development or by the public.
H. To reduce erosion and sedimentation by retaining existing vegetation and minimizing
development on steep slopes.
I. To allow for the continuation of agricultural uses in those areas best suited for such
activities and when such activities are compatible with adjoining residential uses.
J. To permit various means for owning common open space and for protecting it from
development in perpetuity.
K. To create an attitude of stewardship, or caring, for the land within common open space
by requiring a land management, or stewardship, plan for the common open space.
L. To implement the objectives of the adopted City Comprehensive Plan, or elements
thereof.
City of Marinette 36 Code of Ordinances
13.01903 Site Plan Required

13.1912 Calculation of Site Capacity
For cluster development, the calculation of site capacity, or the number of
dwelling units permitted on a site, shall be based on net buildable acreage. The
applicant shall determine the net buildable acreage (NBA) using the following
method, substantiated by sufficient plans and data to verify the calculations:
Gross Acreage of Site:__________ acres
From the gross acreage of the site, subtract the following:
All lands located within existing street rights-of-way:__________ acres
All lands located within existing utility and railway rights-of-way:_________
acres
All lands located within a floodplain:_________ acres
All lands located within a wetland:__________ acres
All of the area located within a pond or lake:__________ acres
City of Marinette 39 Code of Ordinances
Fifty percent of lands having a slope between 12 and 20 percent:__________
acres
All of the land area having a slope of 20 percent or greater:__________ acres
Twenty-five percent of the area located within a woodland:__________ acres
The result is the net buildable acreage (NBA):__________ acres
A. In the calculation in the Section above, the following shall apply:
1. The elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval floodplain determined
through floodplain studies shall be used where available. Where such flood
stage data are not available, the regulatory flood elevation shall be
determined by a registered professional engineer and the sealed report of the
engineer setting forth the regulatory flood stage and the method of its
determination shall be approved by the City Engineer/Public Works
Director.
2. Where two or more categories overlap, the overlapping acreage shall be
counted only once, using the most restrictive classification.
B. To determine the number of units permitted on a given site, the net buildable acreage
shall be multiplied by 5, rounding to the nearest whole number.
__________ acres NBA ¸ 5 = _____________dwelling units permitted.
13.1913 Design Standards for Cluster Groups
The following standards shall apply to all cluster groups:
A. All dwelling units shall be grouped into cluster groups, each of which shall be
surrounded by common open space.
B. The maximum number of lots in a cluster group may be increased, and cluster groups
may be assembled into larger groupings, with the approval of the City Council and provided
that the applicant can demonstrate that such an alternative plan is more appropriate for the
development parcel and will meet both the general intent and design standards of this
Ordinance.
C. A plat may contain one or more cluster groups.
D. Cluster groups shall be defined by the outer perimeter of contiguous lotted areas or
abutting streets, and may contain lots, streets, and cluster group open space. When the
development does not include individual lots, as in a condominium, the outer perimeter shall be
defined as an area encompassed by a line drawn around the units, no point of which is less than
100 feet from any unit.
E. The outer boundaries of each cluster group shall meet the separation distance
requirements specified in this Section.
F. Cluster groups shall be defined and separated by common open space in order to
provide direct access to common open space and privacy to individual lot or yard areas. Cluster
groups may be separated by streets if the street right-of-way is designed as a boulevard.
G. No cluster group shall contain more than 15 dwelling units.
City of Marinette 40 Code of Ordinances
H. Cluster groups containing 11 or more dwelling units must provide internal open space
at a minimum rate of 2,000 square feet per dwelling unit, and shall meet the following
standards:
1. Common open space located within cluster groups shall be counted toward
meeting the overall 60 percent open space requirement.
2. The open space shall be configured as a cul-de-sac island, an island within a
larger loop or an “eyebrow” (a semi-circular loop), an island in a boulevard
street, or a common green area. Common green areas surrounded by lots on
up to three sides shall be designed as a space for common use by all
residents within the cluster group.
3. The open space shall have a minimum street frontage of 125 feet.
4. Internal open space may contain parking areas, but parking areas shall not be
included in the required 2,000 square feet of internal open space per
dwelling unit.
5. All lots in a cluster group shall take access from interior streets.
6. All lots in a cluster group shall abut common open space to the front or rear.
Common open space across a street shall qualify for this requirement.
7. In locating cluster groups, disturbance to woodlands, hedgerows, and
individual mature trees shall be minimized. However, when the objective is
to preserve prime farmland soils and large areas of contiguous land suitable
for agricultural use, dwellings may be located within woodlands, provided
that no more than 20 percent of a single wooded lot is cleared for the
construction of a dwelling, driveway, garage, storage building, well, and
private onsite waste treatment system.
13.1914 Design Standards for Common Open Space

ridge tops or hill tops.
9. A minimum of 80 percent of the area of existing woodlands shall be
contained within common open space. Up to 20 percent of the area of
existing woodlands may be located within lots or used for residential
development. This limitation may be exceeded under the following
conditions:
(a) The site is primarily wooded and development at the permitted
density would not be possible without encroaching further into the
woodlands.
(b) Any encroachment on woodlands beyond 20 percent shall be the
minimum needed to achieve the maximum permitted density, as
determined by the City Council.
10. No area of common open space shall be less than 30 feet in its smallest
dimension or less than 10,000 square feet in area, with the exception of
landscape islands as described in this Section. Open space not meeting this
standard shall not be counted toward the total required 60 percent common
open space.
City of Marinette 42 Code of Ordinances
11. The boundaries of common open space shall be marked by natural features
wherever possible, such as hedgerows, edges of woodlands, streams, or
individual large trees. Where no such natural demarcations exist, additional
plantings, fences, or other landscape features should be added to enable
residents or the public, if applicable, to distinguish where common open
space ends and private lot areas begin. Where structural demarcations, such
as fences, are used, they shall be the minimum needed to accomplish this
objective.
12. Trails in common open space that are located within 50 feet of homes in
cluster groups shall be identified by plantings, fences, or other landscape
features.
13. Under no circumstances shall all common open space be isolated in one area
of the development. Common open space shall be distributed appropriately
throughout the development to properly serve and enhance all dwelling
units, cluster groups, and other common facilities.
14. Common open space shall include lands located along existing public streets
in order to preserve existing rural landscape character as seen from these
streets, and shall, in no case, contain less than the required buffer, setback
area, or separation distance.
C. Safe and convenient pedestrian access and access for maintenance purposes shall be
provided to common open space areas that are not used for agricultural purposes, in accordance
with the following:
1. At least one access point per cluster group shall be provided, having a width
equal to or greater than the minimum width of a lot within the cluster group.
This width may be reduced to no less than 50 feet if the applicant can
demonstrate that, due to natural site constraints, meeting the lot width
requirement would run counter to the objectives of this Section.
2. Access to common open space used for agriculture may be restricted for
public safety and to prevent interference with agricultural operations.
D. The following areas shall not be included in the calculation of common open space
areas:
1. Private lot areas.

transferred between properties within the RC District. Density may be increased on
the receiving parcel, while density is decreased on the sending parcel, in order to
achieve the above-stated objectives. The following requirements shall be met:
1. The density exchange option shall be utilized only with residential cluster
development. Residential development on the receiving parcels must be
clustered, as well as any remaining dwellings on the sending parcel.
2. Density exchanges may be used in combination with lot averaging.
Negotiations for density exchanges shall take place strictly between property
owners and developers and shall not involve the City, other than for the
approval of the number of units transferred, the resulting densities, and normal
City of Marinette 48 Code of Ordinances
plat approval for both the sending and receiving parcels.
3. The applicant shall provide documentation at the time of submittal of the
preliminary plat indicating that he or she is the owner of the sending parcel
or has the authority under the terms of a written contract to make
commitments on the sending parcel. Similar documentation must be
submitted by the owner of the receiving parcel indicating agreement that the
density on such parcel may be increased by the stated number of dwelling
units.
B. Sending and receiving parcels must meet the following requirements:
1. Sending Parcels
(a) The minimum area shall consist of 35 contiguous acres. For the
purposes of this Subsection, parcels separated by a utility right-ofway
shall be considered contiguous.
(b) Sending parcels may consist of one or more contiguous, smaller
parcels that together form at least 35 acres; however, all parcels
must be consolidated into one at the time that the final plat and
easement agreement for the sending parcel are recorded.
(c) The sending parcel shall not be subject to any existing recorded
easement or other agreement which restricts its subdivision or
development.
(d) Sending parcels designated for agricultural use must be consistent
with practical requirements for an agricultural activity and be of
value for farm use, as determined by the City Council based on
information submitted by the applicant. If this requirement cannot
be met, the parcel must contribute to the objective of conserving
significant environmental areas and rural landscape character
beyond that which could be preserved by cluster development.
(e) The sending parcel shall be restricted from development through a
conservation easement held by the City. Such easement shall be
recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds. The
conservation easement shall specify the degree of restriction by the
number of dwelling units that have been transferred from the site.
(f) Density may be transferred from a sending parcel at a maximum
rate of one dwelling unit per 5 net acres as calculated in accordance
with this Section. All or some of the number of units permitted on
the sending parcel may be transferred.
(g) When the density exchange option is used, at least 50 percent of the
permitted units on a sending parcel must be transferred.

provided that each additional unit above base density is acquired from a
sending parcel.
5. The landscaping regulations of this Section of the Ordinance shall apply to
all residential development on receiving parcels.

The exchange of density within the RC Rural Cluster District shall take place as a
private exchange between property owners, subject to approval by the City Council
in accordance with the procedures set forth below.
1. An application for use of the density exchange option on a receiving parcel
shall be made to the City Council and shall include the following:

the sending parcel and the resulting net density on the receiving
parcel.
2. The City Council shall tentatively approve the use of the density exchange
option on the receiving parcel and allow the applicant to proceed with the
subdivision process if:
(a) The receiving parcel meets the criteria of this Section; and
(b) The sketch plan for the receiving parcel represents a subdivision
which can be accommodated on the property, while protecting at
least 45 percent of the gross site area in common open space, and

the proposed cluster subdivision. The subdivision shall meet all of
the requirements for cluster development specified in this
Ordinance.
4. Subdivisions on a receiving parcel may be recorded in phases. A final
subdivision plat shall not be approved for the receiving parcel until the final
subdivision plat for one or more sending parcels are approved, which
provide the necessary number of additional dwelling units for the lots shown
on the final subdivision plat. If one sending parcel provides the additional
dwelling units for more than one receiving parcel, the final subdivision plats
for all of the receiving parcels must be approved at one time.
5. Following approval of the final subdivision plat(s) for the receiving
parcel(s,) the following documents shall be recorded at the same time in the

recorded as unbuildable until further subdivision occurs. Final plats
for cluster subdivisions on the holding lots shall follow all the
requirements of this Section.
6. Plats on sending and receiving parcels shall follow all the requirements of
the City Land Division Control Ordinance.
7. Lot Averaging

the area by which it is reduced is added to another lot, and further
provided that, in all cases, proper water supply and sewerage
facilities shall be provided.
(b) Lot areas, widths, and setbacks shall not be reduced below the

building, improvement, or structure located thereon, or any area of particular
historic, architectural, archeological, or cultural significance to the city, such as
historic structures, sites, or districts which:
A. Exemplify or reflect the broad cultural, political, economic, or social history of the
nature, state, or community;
B. Are identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state, or
local history;

inherently valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction, or of indigenous
materials or craftsmanship;
D. Are representative of the notable work of a master builder, designer, or architect who
influenced his age; or
E. Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history.
13.03105 Powers and Duties of Commission
The commission may adopt specific operating guidelines for historic structure,
historic site, and historic district designation providing such are in conformance
with the provisions of this chapter.
City of Marinette 99 Code of Ordinances
A. Designation
Upon request of the property owner, the commission shall have the power, subject
to this Ordinance, to designate historic structures and historic sites. The
commission shall have the power to recommend designation of historic districts
within the city limits. Such designations shall be made based on this Ordinance.
Historic districts shall be approved by the common council. Once designated, such
historic structures, sites, and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this
chapter.
B. Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration, and demolition
No owner or person in charge of an historic structure, historic site, or structure
within an historic district shall reconstruct, alter, or demolish all or any part of the
exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated
property or properties, or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon
such property, or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has
been granted by the historic preservation commission. Unless such certificate has
been granted by the commission, the building inspector shall not issue a permit for
any such work.
C. Certificate of Appropriateness Approval
Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness with the
commission, the commission shall approve the application unless:
1. In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed
work would detrimentally change, destroy, or adversely affect any exterior
architectural feature of the improvement or site upon which said work is to
be done;
2. In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon an historic site or
within an historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely
affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring
improvements on such site or within the district;
3. In the case of any property located in an historic district, the proposed
construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or demolition does not
conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives and
design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said district;
4. The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance
that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to
the general welfare of the people of the city and state;
5. The building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design,
texture, and/or material that it could not be reproduced without great
difficulty and/or expense;
6. Except as provided herein, in the case of a request for the demolition of a
deteriorated building or structure, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the
owner is self-created or is the result of any failure to maintain the property in
good repair. Upon the request for a demolition permit for a structure
determined to be unfit for human habitation, occupancy, or use by any
authorized public official or agency, the commission may defer the granting
of approval for a period of up to six months from the time of such
application, during which time the commission and the property owner shall
City of Marinette 100 Code of Ordinances
undertake serious and continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a
method to save such property. During such period, the property owner and
the commission shall cooperate in attempting to avoid demolition of the
property. At the end of this six-month period, if no mutually agreeable
method of saving
the subject property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual success is
under way, or if no formal application for funds from any governmental unit
or nonprofit organization to preserve the subject property is pending, the
building inspector may issue the permit to demolish the subject property
without the approval of the commission. If such mutually agreeable method
for saving the subject property is not successful or no such funds to preserve
the subject property have been obtained and available for disbursement
within a period of two months following the end of such six-month period,
the building inspector may issue the permit to demolish the subject property
without the approval of the commission.
D. Additional Standards
In addition, in determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the
commission shall consider and may give decisive weight to any or all of the
following standards:
1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use
that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building
and its site and environment.
2. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
3. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and
use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as
adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings,
shall not be undertaken.
4. Most properties change over time. Those changes that have acquired historic
significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
5. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of
craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where
the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the
new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to
historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if
appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
8. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected
and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures
shall be undertaken.
City of Marinette 101 Code of Ordinances
9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall
be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size,
scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment.
10. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken
in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
E. Issuance of Certificate of Appropriateness
If the commission determines that the application for a certificate of
appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with the character and features
of the property or district and with the above guidelines, it shall issue the certificate of
appropriateness. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the building permit shall then be
issued by the building inspector. The commission shall make this decision within 45 days
of the filing of the application. Failure of the commission to act upon a request for a
certificate of appropriateness within 45 days shall result in the issuance of such
certificate.
F. Agencies of the city and all public utility and transportation companies undertaking
projects affecting historic structures, historic sites, or historic districts shall be required to obtain
a certificate of appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street paving,
sidewalks, utility installations, lighting, walls, fences, structures, and buildings on property,
easements, or streets owned or franchised by the city.
G. The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from
obtaining other permits and approvals required by the city. A building permit or other municipal
permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the certificate of
appropriateness required for the proposed work. Insofar as they are applicable to an historic
structure, historic site, or improvement in an historic district designated under this section, any
provision of the plumbing code, electrical code, or building or housing of the city shall apply
unless waived by the appropriate state or city officials. The commission may support or oppose
such waivers before the appropriate state or city appeals body.
H. Compliance with certificates of appropriateness shall be started within 12 months after
the issuance of the certificate, and the work shall conform to the provisions of the certificate.
The city may inspect the work during and after construction in order to assure compliance.
Failure to comply with a certificate of appropriateness or failure to obtain a certificate of
appropriateness shall be a violation of this section. In addition to other penalties and remedies,
the city shall issue a stop work order, and all work shall cease on the designated property. No
additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect.
I. Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of
appropriateness provided the work involves repairs to existing features of an historic structure or
site, or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance, and
provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does
not require the issuance of a building permit.
13.03106 Appeals
Should the commission deny a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the
proposal to conform to the guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the
common council within 30 days. In addition, if the commission denies a certificate of
appropriateness, the commission shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work with
City of Marinette 102 Code of Ordinances
the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness within the guidelines
of this chapter.
13.03107 Recognition of Historic Structures, Sites, and Districts
At such time as an historic structure, site, or district has been properly designated, the
commission may cause to be prepared and erected on such property, at city expense, a
suitable plaque declaring that such property is an historic structure, site, or district. Such
plaque shall be so placed as to be easily visible to passing pedestrians. The plaque shall
state the accepted name of the historic property, the date of its construction, and other
information deemed proper by the commission.
13.03108 Other Duties
In addition to those duties already specified in this section, the commission shall:
A. Work for the continuing education of the citizens about the historical heritage of the
city and the historic properties designated under the provisions of this chapter.
B. Cooperate with the state historic preservation officer and the state historic preservation
review board in attempting to include such properties hereunder designated as landmarks or
landmark sites, or historic districts in the National Register of Historic Places and the State
Register of Historic Places.
C. As it deems advisable, receive and solicit funds for the purpose of historic preservation
in the city. Such funds shall be placed in a special city account for such purpose.
13.03109 Designation of historic structures and historic sites
A. The commission may, after notice and public hearing, designate historic structures and
historic sites or rescind such designation or recommendation after application of the criteria
listed above. At least ten days prior to such hearing, the commission shall notify the owners of
record, as listed in the office of the city assessor, who are owners of property in whole or in part
situated within 100 feet of the boundaries of the property affected. These owners shall have the
right to confer with the commission prior to final action by the commission on the designation.
Notice of such hearing shall also be published as a Class 1 Notice under theWisconsin Statutes.
The commission shall also notify the following: department of public works, redevelopment
authority, parks department, fire and police departments, health department, building inspection
department, and plan commission. Each such department may respond to the commission with
its comments on the proposed designation or rescission.
B. The commission shall then conduct such public hearing and, in addition to the notified
persons, may hear expert witnesses and shall have the power to subpoena such witnesses and
records as it deems necessary. The commission may conduct an independent investigation into
the proposed designation or rescission.Within ten days after the close of the public hearing, the
commission may designate the property as either an historic structure or historic site, or rescind
the designation. After the designation or rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to
the property owner or owners. Notification shall also be given to the city clerk, building
inspection department, plan commission, and the city assessor. The commission shall cause the
designation or rescission to be recorded, at city expense, in the county register of deeds office.
C. Before the City designates a historic landmark or establishes a historic district, the City
shall hold a public hearing. If the City proposes to designate a place, structure, or object as a
historic landmark or establish a historic district that includes a place, structure, or object, the
City shall, by first class mail, notify the owner of the place, structure or object of the
City of Marinette 103 Code of Ordinances
determination and of the time and place of the public hearing on the determination. An owner
of property that is affected by a decision of the City of Marinette Historic Preservation
Commission may appeal the decision to the Common Council. The Common Council may
overturn the decision of the Historic Preservation Commission.
State Law Reference: 2015 Wisconsin Act 176; Wis. Stats. Sec. 62.23(7)(em)2 and 3.
13.3110 Designation of Historic Districts

geographically defined areas within the city to be designated as historic districts and shall, with
the assistance of the city planning department, prepare an historic preservation plan in ordinance

13.3200 WATERFRONT OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
Traditional water dependent uses such as cargo handling, commercial marinas,
boatyards, and fishing docks are of vital importance for maintaining the economic
viability and maritime heritage of the City of Marinette’s waterfront. However,
maritime centers have experienced varying degrees of economic decline in recent
years; some water dependent uses are potentially subject to displacement by
nonwater dependent uses, and a number of sites suitable for water dependent use
are now vacant or underutilized.
An important goal of the Marinette Comprehensive Plan and the City of Marinette
Waterfront Plan is to enhance the existing natural amenities and resources, and
maintain and enhance the social, economic and environmental benefits associated
with the waterfront area where feasible for the enjoyment by residents and
visitors, and future generations through the application of appropriate techniques
(including zoning and other land use laws and regulations) to support traditional
water dependent uses.
13.03201 Intent of Waterfront Overlay Zones
The intents of the waterfront overlay zoning districts are to:
A. Protect industrial (water dependent) uses from encroachment from incompatible uses;
B. Allow existing water dependent industrial and commercial uses to operate more
successfully through, for example, permitting appropriate outside storage facilities; and
C. Allow expansion of existing water dependent facilities where feasible.
13.03202 Site Plan Review Required
Plan Commission review of site plans for all new or expanding development in
the waterfront overlay zones is required. The level of detail required in the site
plan review process is determined on a case by case basis. Upon the request of the
applicant, a preliminary conference involving the applicant, Plan Commission,
and a representative of the Public Works/Building Department may be held to
enable review of the basic site design concept prior to preparation and submission
of the formal site plan. The Site Plan Review required by this Ordinance (Section
13.100) specifies the application requirements, including the information to be
provided. A number of the specific items of information to be provided are
applicable to the review of waterfront development proposals. For example, the
submitted site plan must show:
A. Location of proposed land and water uses and the proposed use, dimensions, height,
and
B. Architectural features of all structures;
C. Location of outdoor storage (boat storage, for example) and description of material to
be stored;

and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land, are mutually
compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses which,
because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as
unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of these uses upon neighboring land or
public facilities, and of the public need for the particular use at a particular
location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a
particular district provided that due consideration is given to location,
development and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as Conditional
Uses.

Commission may require such other information as may be necessary to
determine and provide for an enforcement of this Chapter, including a plan
showing contours, soil types, high water mark, ground water conditions, bedrock,
vegetative cover and specifications for areas of proposed filling, grading, and
lagooning.
The City shall grant a conditional use permit if an applicant meets, or agrees to
meet, all of the requirements and conditions specified in this ordinance or
imposed by the Plan Commission. Any such conditions must be related to the
purpose of the ordinance and based on substantial evidence. In addition, those
requirements and conditions must be reasonable and, to the extent practicable,
measurable.

conditions upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the
subject Conditional Use. In the event that no reasonable modification of such
Conditional Use can be made in order to assure that the standards in this
Ordinance will be met, the Marinette Plan Commission may revoke the subject
conditional approval and direct the Building Inspector and the City Attorney to
seek elimination of the subject use. Following any such hearing, the decision of
the Marinette Plan Commission shall be furnished the current owner of the

13.3912 Telecommunication Facilities and Antennas
A. Purpose. The purpose and intent of this ordinance is to strike a balance between the
federal interest concerning the construction, modification and siting of
telecommunication towers and antennas for use in providing personal wireless
services, and the interest of the City of Marinette (hereinafter the "City") in
regulating local zoning. The regulations contained herein are designed to protect and
promote the public health, safety and welfare of the community and the aesthetic
quality of the City. The goals of this ordinance are to protect residential areas and
land uses from the potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; minimize the
total number of towers throughout the community; encourage the joint use of new
and existing tower sites as a primary siting option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers; minimize the visual impact of towers and antennas; and
avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering
and careful siting of tower structures. It is also the intent of this section to provide a
public forum to insure a balance between public concerns and private interests in
establishing commercial telecommunication and related facilities. This section is
intended to regulate mobile service facilities to the full extent allowed by Wis. Stat.
§66.0404 and other applicable laws. Nothing herein is intended to regulate or to
authorize the regulation of mobile services facilities in a manner that is preempted or
prohibited by Wis. Stat. §66.0404 or other applicable laws.

be a conditional use, subject to the ordinary conditional use regulations and
procedures of this chapter. In addition, the following requirements must be
met:
1. Before a new tower site is requested, all the existing tower facilities shall
be considered and evaluated. If an existing facility cannot be used, a
justification report, citing the reasons it cannot be used must be provided
City of Marinette 177 Code of Ordinances
with the application as described in subsection (c)1 above.
2. All new antenna support structures shall be mono-poles; which are
defined as a smooth tapered pole, without stepped sections or guy wires.
3. All new antenna support structures shall be constructed to a standard that
permits the collocation of a minimum of three telecommunication
company facilities on a single tower.
4. All antennas and/or towers and other communications equipment shall be
removed from the site within 60 days of use termination by the
telecommunications company.

City of Marinette 178 Code of Ordinances
application if it is found not to be complete, and such notice shall
specify in detail the required information that was incomplete.
Applicants are allowed to resubmit their applications as often as
necessary until it is complete.
6. Inventory and Tracking System. The Building Inspector/Zoning
Administrator shall compile a list of existing telecommunications facilities
within the City's jurisdiction based upon information provided by personal
wireless services providers and telecommunications tower owners. The
Building Inspector/Zoning Administrator shall maintain and update said list
on a regular basis. The list shall also include the location of public facilities
that may be available for co-location.
D. Abandonment. If a telecommunication facility shall cease to be used for a period
exceeding one year and a day, the owner or operator of said facility, above ground
and below ground to a depth of 4’ shall remove the facility upon the written request
of the Building Inspector/Zoning Administrator at no cost to the City within 90 days
of said request.
E. Structural Requirements. Every telecommunication facility shall be designed and
constructed so as to comply with the requirements of Secs. COMM 62.35 to 62.41,
Wisconsin Administrative Code, amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
Building Inspector/Zoning Administrator concludes that a tower fails to comply with
such codes, in effect at the time of construction, and constitutes a danger to persons
or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner
shall have 30 days or such time as determined by the Building Inspector/Zoning
Administrator to bring such tower into compliance with said codes. Failure to bring
such tower into compliance within said 30 days or such time as determined by the

nonflammable material, unless specifically permitted by the City to be
otherwise.
2. Telecommunication support facilities (i.e., equipment rooms, utilities, and
equipment enclosures) shall be constructed out of nonreflective materials
(visible exterior surfaces only) to all extent possible and, where possible,
shall be sited below the ridge line or designed to minimize their impact.
City of Marinette 179 Code of Ordinances
3. Telecommunication equipment buildings, shelters and cabinets shall be
treated to look like a building or facility typically found in the area.
4. The City shall have the authority to require reasonable special design
(materials, architectural features and color) of the telecommunication
facilities where findings of particular sensitivity are made (e.g. proximity
to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views and/or community
features).
5. Telecommunication facilities shall insure that sufficient anti-climbing
measures have been incorporated into the facility, as needed, to reduce
potential for trespass and injury.
6. Equipment buildings shall be located, designed and screened to reduce
visual impacts to the extent feasible considering the technological
requirements of the proposed personal wireless services and the need to be
compatible with neighboring residences and the character of the
community.
7. Antennas shall be designed to blend with its supporting structure. The
color selected shall be one that in the opinion of the Plan Commission will
minimize the visibility of the antennas to the greatest extent feasible.
G. Site restrictions.
Site restrictions are as follows:
a. The exterior of all buildings shall be architecturally compatible and consistent
with surrounding building and structures and constructed in accordance with the
plan approved appropriately and shall be neatly maintained at all times.
b. The telecommunications facilities may not include offices, vehicle storage, or
outdoor storage or broadcast studios; except for emergency purposes or other
uses that are not needed to send or receive transmission as determined by the
City.
c. There shall be adequate space on site to accommodate maintenance vehicles.
d. A site grading and storm water drainage plan shall be reviewed and approved by
the Building Inspector/Zoning Administrator.
e. Areas not used for parking or drives shall be landscaped according to the plan
approved.
f. Parking lot and security lighting is to be installed and maintained in a manner
that will avoid glare or excessive illumination spilling over on adjoining
properties.
H. Location. All new telecommunication facilities shall be located so as to minimize
City of Marinette 180 Code of Ordinances
their visibility and the number of tower sites. To this end, a good faith effort in
achieving co-location shall be required of the requestor and host entity, subject to
existing co-location contracts; and all of the following measures shall be
implemented for telecommunication facilities in addition to meeting the conditional
use standards in MMC 13.3906 of these ordinances:
1. No telecommunications tower shall be installed closer than one-quarter mile from
another telecommunications tower, measured from the base of the
telecommunications tower to the base of the proposed tower, unless it is a tower
situated on a multi-tower zoning lot, or credible evidence to a reasonable degree
of certainty acceptable to the Plan Commission is submitted showing a clear need
for said new tower and the infeasibleness of co-locating it on an existing site. For
the purposes of this requirement, exempt telecommunications facilities
unavailable for co- location shall not be included in the one-quarter mile
computation;
2. No telecommunications tower shall be installed on a zoning lot that is not already
developed with a telecommunications tower unless the applicant demonstrates
that no tower in the area that the applicants equipment must be located is of
sufficient height to meet applicant's requirements and the deficiency in height
cannot be remedied at a reasonable cost; or the existing tower is not of sufficient
strength to support applicant's equipment and the deficiency in structural strength
cannot be remedied at a reasonable cost; or the applicant's equipment would cause
electromagnetic interference with equipment on the existing telecommunications
tower(s) within the area in which the applicant's equipment must be located, or the
equipment on the existing telecommunications tower(s) would cause interference
with the applicant's equipment and the interference, from whatever source, cannot
be eliminated at a reasonable cost; or the fees, costs or contractual provisions
required by the owner in order to co-locate on an existing communication tower
are unreasonable relative to industry norms; or the applicant demonstrates that
there are other factors that render existing communication towers unsuitable or
unavailable and establishes that the public interest is best served by the placement
or construction of a new telecommunications tower.
3. No telecommunication tower shall be located on a lot in a residence district, unless
said lot is greater than two (2) acres in area and the principal use is other than
residential.
4. Telecommunications towers, guy-wires, appurtenant equipment and buildings
shall comply with the yard and set back requirements of the zoning district in
which they are located.
I. Co-located and Multiple-User Facilities.
1. Unless applicant is submitting an application to locate or co-locate upon an
existing tower or structure, an analysis shall be prepared by or on behalf of the
applicant; subject to the approval of the Plan Commission, which identifies all
reasonable, technically feasible alternative locations and/or facilities which
would be useable for the proposed personal wireless services. The intention of
the alternatives analysis is to present alternative strategies which would minimize
City of Marinette 181 Code of Ordinances
the number, size and adverse environmental impacts, including aesthetics, of
facilities necessary to provide the needed services to the City and surrounding
rural and urban areas. The analysis shall address the potential for co-location at
an existing or a new site and the potential to locate facilities as close as possible
to the intended service area. It shall also explain the rationale for selection of the
proposed site in view of the relative merits of any of the feasible alternatives.
Approval of the project is subject to the Plan Commission making a finding that
the proposed site results in fewer or less severe environmental impacts, including
aesthetics, than any feasible alternative site. The City may require independent
verification by a qualified engineer of this analysis at the applicant's expense.
Facilities which are not proposed to be co-located with another
telecommunication facility shall provide a written explanation why the subject
facility is not a candidate for co-location.
2. 2. All new telecommunications towers shall be structurally and electrically
designed to accommodate at least three (3) separate antenna arrays, unless
credible evidence is presented that said construction is economically and
technologically unfeasible or the Plan Commission determines that for reasons of
aesthetics or to comply with the standards of MMC 13.3906, a
telecommunications tower of such height to accommodate three antenna arrays is
unwarranted. Multi-user telecommunications towers shall be designed to allow
for future rearrangement of antennas and to accept antennas mounted at varying
heights. Parking areas, access roads, and utility easements shall be shared by site
users, at fair market rates as determined by customary industry standards, when
in the determination of the Plan Commission this will minimize overall visual
impact to the community.
J. Exempt Facilities.
1. Amateur radio towers installed, erected, maintained and/or operated in any
residential zoning district, by a federally-licensed amateur radio operator,
complying with the provisions contained in these ordinances, so long as all the
following conditions are met:
a. The antenna use involved is accessory to the primary use of the property
which is not a telecommunication facility;
b. In a residential zone, no more than one support structure for licensed amateur
radio operator is allowed on the parcel;
c. Sufficient anti-climbing measures have been incorporated into the facility, as
needed, to reduce potential for trespass and injury.
2. Publicly owned and operated telecommunications facilities required in the public
interest to provide for and maintain a radio frequency telecommunication system,
including digital, analog, wireless or electromagnetic waves, for police, fire and
other municipal services.

rather than describe the new structure or facility.
(b) Non-substantial modifications.
1. Application information. The applicant shall submit a written application that
describes the applicant’s basis for concluding that the modification is not
substantial, and all of the following information:
(a) The name and business address of, and the contact individual for, the
applicant.
(b) The location of the affected support structure.
(c) The location of the proposed facility.
2. Fee. Any petition shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount established
below. Costs incurred by the city in obtaining legal, planning, engineering
and other technical and professional advice in connection with the review of
the application and preparation of the conditions to be imposed shall be

exceed the limits established by Wis. Stat. §66.0404(4).
3. Completeness determination within five days. The Building
Inspector/Zoning Administrator will determine whether the application is
complete. If the application includes all of the foregoing information, the
application shall be found to be complete. The Building Inspector/Zoning
Administrator must notify the applicant in writing within five days of
receiving the application if it is found not to be complete, specifying in
detail the required information that was incomplete. The applicant may
resubmit as often as necessary until it is complete.

decision on the application within 45 days of receipt of a complete
application, unless the time is extended by the petitioner. The decision shall
City of Marinette 183 Code of Ordinances
be stated in writing. If approval is not granted, the reasons therefore will be
included in such record.
5. Limitations upon authority. The city review and action in the matter shall
be subject to the limitations imposed by Wis. Stat. §66.0404(4), and such
other laws as may apply which may include 47 USCA § 1455. In the
event the applicant believes the city has exceeded its authority in this
regard, the applicant shall notify the city in writing and the city reserves
the right to reconsider the matter, to ensure that applicable laws are
followed.
L. Hold Harmless. Telecommunications companies that are parties to conditional use
permits shall warrant the safety of the technology of the facilities and hold the City,
its officers, and employees harmless for any claims or losses to the city or its
residents; including reasonable attorney fees arising from, or related to, the use of the
facilities.
M. Bond. The telecommunications company shall provide a bond, naming the city as
beneficiary, in the penal amount of $20,000.00 sufficient to assure removal of the
antenna, antenna support structures, facility buildings, fences and driveways, and
restoration of the site, as near as practicable, to its current condition.
N. Binding effect. Telecommunications companies shall be bound by any other
condition recommended by the Plan commission and/or approved by the Common
Council.
O. Penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this ordinance or fails to comply
with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof forfeit not less than ten
dollars ($10.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each violation, and
in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

13.04001 Statement of Purpose
Zoning regulations are generally prospective, that is, they apply to uses of land proposed
to be established after the regulations go into effect. This Ordinance provides rules for a
variety of situations in which uses were established, lots were created, buildings were
constructed, etc. prior to the enactment of zoning. After the enactment, questions arise as
to continuance, change in use, expansion, etc. Within the Zoning Districts established by
this ordinance, there may exist uses, buildings, structures, and lots that do not conform to
the provisions of this ordinance. The purpose of this Section is to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which these nonconforming uses, buildings,
structures and lots shall be permitted to continue.
13.04002 Buildings under Construction
Buildings or structures on which construction was started or for which a
construction contract was entered into before the effective date of this Ordinance

ordinances in effect on the date the construction project commenced.
13.04003 Nonconforming Buildings, Structures Uses and Lots
A. Statement of Purpose
The Zoning Ordinance establishes separate and distinct zoning districts, each of
which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that
district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those districts that
those nonconforming buildings, structures, uses and lots which affect the orderly
development and taxable value of other property in the district not be permitted to
continue without restrictions.
The purpose of this Section is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming
buildings, structures, uses and lots, and to specify those circumstances and
conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures, uses and lots
shall be permitted to continue.
B. Definitions
1. ”Nonconforming use” means a use of land, a dwelling, or a building that
existed lawfully before the current zoning ordinance was enacted or
amended, but that does not conform with one or more of the development

date of this ordinance may be continued although it does not conform to the provisions of this
ordinance, provided that: (a) Structural repairs or structural alterations to the building or
structure shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total assessed value of the building or
structure, unless the owner is granted permission to exceed (50%) of the total assessed value of
the building or structure by applying for, and being granted, a Conditional Use Permit by the
City of Marinette Plan Commission. (b) The nonconforming use shall not be extended or
expanded, unless the owner is granted permission to extend or expand their nonconforming use
by applying for, and being granted, a Conditional Use Permit by the City of Marinette Plan
Commission (c) The building or structure does not become and remain vacant for a continuous
period of twelve (12) months. (d) The nonconforming use of the land does not cease for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months.

(12) months, any future use of the structure, land, or water shall conform to the
provisions of this Chapter.
City of Marinette 185 Code of Ordinances
C. Nonconforming Uses Shall Be Permitted To Continue Subject To The Following:
1. Change of Non-conforming Use.
A non-conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming use only as
a conditional use. A non-conforming use which is changed to a conforming use
shall not revert back to non-conforming use. (Ordinance 2011-2207 adopted 11-1-
11).
13.4005 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES
A lawful nonconforming building or structure existing on the effective date of this
ordinance may be continued although it does not conform to the provisions of this
ordinance with respect to bulk characteristics including, but not limited to, setback, open
space, floor area ratio, height, density, parking facilities, amount of parking, and style.
13.4006 NONCONFORMING LOTS
A. A lawful nonconforming lot existing on the effective date of this ordinance may be
continued although it does not conform to the provision of this ordinance, provided
that the size and shape of the lot shall not be changed in any way to increase the
nonconformity.
Lots of Record. A nonconforming lot may be used for any use permitted within the
zoning district in which the lot is located but shall not be a building site, unless a variance
is granted as provided in mmc. 13.4100, and required setbacks and yards shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals, subject to the
following regulations:

City of Marinette 189 Code of Ordinances
J. Findings
When special conditions unique to a property will not allow the property owner to
meet the dimensional standards of a zoning ordinance, the Board may grant a
dimensional variance upon the finding of the following three standards by clear,
satisfactory and convincing evidence:
1. Unnecessary Hardship
What constitutes unnecessary hardship is a matter to be determined from
the facts and circumstances of each individual case. The Board must abide by
the following Court established principles:
(a) Unnecessary hardship is a situation where, in the absence of a
variance, an owner can make no feasible use of a property, or strict
conformity is unnecessarily burdensome.
(b) The hardship or difficulty must be peculiar to the zoning parcel in
question and different from that of other parcels, not one which
effects all parcels similarly.
(c) Loss of profit or financial hardship is not in and of itself grounds
for a variance.
(d) Self-imposed hardship is not grounds for a variance.
(e) The hardship cannot be one that would have existed in the absence
of the zoning ordinance.
2. Unique Property Limitation
Unique physical characteristics of the property, not the desires of or the property
conditions personal to the applicant, must prevent the applicant from developing
in compliance with the zoning ordinance. (Examples: Wetland designations,
soil type, parcel shape, or steep slope that limits the reasonable use of the
property.)
3. Protection of the Public Interest
Granting a variance must neither harm the public interest nor undermine the
purposes of the ordinance. The Boards’ actions should be consistent with the
objectives stated in the Marinette Zoning Code. The public interest includes the
interests of the public at large, not just that of nearby property owners. In
granting a variance, the Board may impose special conditions to ensure that the
public welfare will not be damaged. The conditions must relate reasonably to
the purpose and intent established by the zoning ordinance.
K. Decision
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide all appeals and applications within
thirty (30) days after the public hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the
Board's decision to the appellant or applicant, Building Inspector, and Marinette
Plan Commission.
L. Conditions may be placed upon any building permit ordered or authorized by this
Board.
M. Variances, Substitutions, or Use Permits granted by the Board shall expire within six
City of Marinette 190 Code of Ordinances
(6) months unless substantial work has commenced pursuant to such grant.
N. Review by a Court Of Record
Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals
may present to the court of record a petition duly verified setting forth that such
decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall
be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office
of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
O. Fee
Any person filing an application with the Board of Appeals for a variance or
interpretation from and of the zoning regulations of the City of Marinette shall pay
an application fee as established from time to time by the Common Council.

historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided.

significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. Distinctive features,
finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a
property shall be preserved.

materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.

TITLE
This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of
Marinette, Wisconsin.
-4
14.0500
GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or
base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps
approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on
the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional
Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one
map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-
30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any
change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of
the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of
Map Change process (see s. 14.700 Amendments) before it is effective. No
changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the
DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the City Engineer,
City of Marinette. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
(a) OFFICIAL MAPS : Based on the FIS:
1. Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 550261 0001 B, dated
March 15, 1978; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) dated June 15, 1977 550261V000;
2. Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM), panel number 5502610001, dated
March 15, 1978.
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA
(b) OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on other studies. Any maps referenced in this
Section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those
based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development.
1. 100-Year Dam Failure Floodplain Map, dated (fill in map date), prepared
by (fill in contractor.) Approved by; The DNR (none exist at the time of
adoption of this Ordinance in the City of Marinette).
2. Letter of Map Revision (Case Number 96-05-2676A dated 12/10/96).
3. Flood Storage Map, Panel number (fill in panel number here), dated (fill in
map date here), approved by: The DNR (none exist at the time of
adoption of this Ordinance in the City of Marinette).
-5
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN ZONING DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(a) The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those
portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional
floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits
and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by
floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway
boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM.
(4) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and
actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subd (a) or (b) below.
If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to s.
14.7000 Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived
from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map
amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for
documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which
the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments
required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an
applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to 14.6300(3)
and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on
established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map
amendment or revision pursuant to s. 14.7000 Amendments.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine
the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if
there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary
shall be determined by the map scale.
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the
regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the
floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to s. 14.7000 Amendments.
(6) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in
compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state,
and federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
-6
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are
required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when
s. 30.2022, Stats., applies.
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under ss. 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; s. 62.23
for cities; s. 61.35 for villages; or s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains.
A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the
extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed
restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the
minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and
are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in
effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the
most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering
experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or
guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from
flooding and flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part
of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(11) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected.
(12) ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES
The Marinette County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all
annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which
meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72,
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described
on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are
on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of
annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

14.1000
GENERAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS
The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed
building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a
flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed
and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials;
be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical
equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision
proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation
and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this
ordinance and all other requirements in s. 14.6100(2). Adequate drainage shall be
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such
as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damages.
14.1100
HYDRAULIC AND HYDROLOGIC ANALYSES
(1) No floodplain development shall:
(a) Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of
floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the
regional flood height; or
(b) Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area
lost.
(2) The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed
development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height,
based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of
s. 14.7000 Amendments are met.
14.1200
WATERCOURSE ALTERATIONS
No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be
issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the
Department and FEMA regional offices, and required the applicant to secure all
necessary state and federal permits. The standards of s. 14.1100 must be met and the
flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse
alteration or relocation and pursuant to s. 14.7000 Amendments, the community shall
apply for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be
reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR through the LOMC process.

construction plans and survey notes.
vi. Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for
which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and
downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations and topwidths
computed by the revised models matching those in the effective models
upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The
Effective Model shall not be truncated.

does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for
a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.
73. STRUCTURE – Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or
temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed,

improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If
the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either
any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or
safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.
77. UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP – Where special conditions affecting a particular property,
which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas,
setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of
the purposes of the ordinance.

the applicant; the capitalization of the applicant; the scope of the proposed
project; the cost of rectifying the possible environmental hazards that could be
created; the effect of the proposed operation on the surrounding
neighborhood; the cost of remediation of the City of Marinette should the City of
Marinette have to address any matter due to the unwillingness or inability of the
Permit Holder to fulfill its obligations. The Issuing Body may annually, upon
documented request of the Permit Holder, review the pertinent facts and decide
to reduce the amount of the required Letter of Credit in accordance with work
completed or threats mitigated. In the extraordinary circumstance that the Issuing
Body determines that the requirements to obtain an Irrevocable Standby Letter of
Credit is unreasonable, the Issuing Body may, in the exercise of its discretion,
authorize one or more alternate forms of security in lieu of an Irrevocable
Standby Letter of Credit.
Language can be inserted or administrative guidance put in place that sets forth
standard amounts for Irrevocable Standby Letters of Credit based on size of
project/materials to be removed/possibility of damage, with language allowing

the Building Inspector or the City Engineer shall be authorized to let
demolition contracts.

CHAPTER 19: SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING ORDINANCE
19.0100 INTRODUCTION
19.0101 Statutory Authorization
This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Sections. 61.35 and 62.23, 62.231, 87.30
and 144.26 of the Wisconsin Statutes.
19.0102 Finding of Fact and Purpose
Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the
municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare
and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all
municipalities to:
A. Promote the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare;
B. Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
C. Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store
sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into
navigable waters;
D. Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving
wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
E. Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
F. Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland
cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling, and other earth moving
activities.
19.0200 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Compliance
The use of wetlands, and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the
municipality shall be in full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other
applicable Local, State, or Federal regulations. (However, see 19.0400 of this
ordinance, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted
development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly
excluded by a provision of this ordinance.
B. Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are
required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of state highways and bridges by
the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Section 30.12(4)(a),
Wis. Stats., applies.
3
C. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted
under Section 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains and shorelandwetlands,
except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than
this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
D. Repeal and Abrogation
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing deed
restrictions, covenants, or easements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
E. Interpretation
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to
be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality
and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the
Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this ordinance is required by a standard in
Chapter NR117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the ordinance provision is unclear, the
provision shall be interpreted in light of the Chapter NR117 standards in effect on the
date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
F. Severability
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.
G. Annexed Areas
The Marinette County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation
remain in effect administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the
municipality after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are described on the
municipality's official zoning map. The Marinette County shoreland zoning provisions
are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on
file in the office of the municipal Zoning Administrator.
19.0300 SHORELAND/WETLAND ZONING DISTRICT
A. Shoreland/Wetland Zoning Maps
The following maps are hereby adopted and made part of this ordinance and are
on file in the office of the municipal Clerk:
1. Wisconsin Wetland Inventory maps stamped "FINAL" on July 22, 1987, which
shall control in case of discrepancies with the Official map, Marinette, Wisconsin.
2. Floodplain zoning maps titled, "U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map for the City of Marinette, WI", and dated
March 15, 1978.
3. United States Geological Survey maps dated 1963.
4
4. Official map, Marinette, Wisconsin, delineating Shoreland-Wetland and
Wetland Districts, and Amended Wetlands to be Removed, as found in Tube File
29 of the Marinette City Engineer's office, dated May, 1988.
B. District Boundaries
The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the municipality which
are five (5) acres or more, and are shown on the Official Map, Marinette, Wisconsin
that has been adopted and made a part of this ordinance (which map is intended to
accurately delineate at a larger scale wetlands of five (5) acres and larger shown on the
final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map) and which are:
1. Within one thousand (1,000) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of
navigable lakes, ponds, or flowages. Lakes, ponds, or flowages in the
municipality shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the
United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps
which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this ordinance.
2. Within three hundred (300) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable
rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance
is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are
designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States
Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have
been incorporated by reference and made a part of this ordinance. Floodplain
zoning maps adopted in Section 19.0300(2) above shall be used to determine
the extent of floodplain areas.
C. Navigability
Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be
made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator
shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination
of navigability or ordinary high-water mark.
D. Discrepancies
If any discrepancy is identified between the shoreland-wetland boundaries shown on
the Official Map, Marinette, Wisconsin, and the wetland boundaries shown on the
final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map, other than in the areas delineated Amended
Wetlands to be Removed, the wetland boundaries shown on the final Wisconsin
Wetland Inventory Map shall control. When an apparent discrepancy exists between
the wetland boundary shown on the final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory maps and
actual field conditions at the time the map was adopted, the Zoning Administrator
shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the
wetland boundary as mapped is in error. If Department staff concur with the Zoning
Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning
Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in
accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to
correct wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in
5
Sections 19.0300 (E) and (F), the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for
initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period.
E. Filled Wetlands
Wetlands which are filled prior to July 22, 1987, the date on which the municipality
received final wetland inventory maps, in a manner which affects their wetland
characteristics to the extent that the area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not
subject to this ordinance.
F. Wetlands Landward of a Bulkhead Line
Wetlands located between the original ordinary high-water mark and a bulkhead line
established prior to May 7, 1982, under Sec. 30.11, Wis. Stats., are not subject to this
ordinance.

The shoreland-wetland provisions of this ordinance authorized by Sec. 62.231, Wis.
Stats., shall not limit the repair, reconstruction, renovation, remodeling, or expansion of a
nonconforming structure in existence on the effective date of the shoreland-wetland

conform with the provisions of this ordinance. However, such nonconforming use may not
be extended.
