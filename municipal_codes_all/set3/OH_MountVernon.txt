   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL

DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, Council has had the matter of codification and general revision of
the ordinances before it for some time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, are before
the Council,
   BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Mount Vernon, Ohio:
   SECTION 1.  That the ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon,
Ohio, 1989.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City.
   SECTION 2.  That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided by
law.  All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior to which
are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby
repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment
shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act
committed in violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.

be viewed at any other location designated by Council.  The Solicitor shall
review the summary prior to forwarding it to the Clerk for publication to
ensure that the summary is legally accurate and sufficient.
   SECTION 4.  That each section of the Codified Ordinances without an
ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section
contains new material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance.
   SECTION 5.  That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance, the
Mayor and Clerk of Council shall certify that the permanent and general
ordinances of the Municipality as codified therein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of Mount Vernon, Ohio, 1989.
   SECTION 6.  That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency
measure necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, welfare and
safety for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the
earliest publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is

reference.

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

         (d)    An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under
this division does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's
obligation to file any return as required under this section.  Once the
threshold for remitting payment electronically for federal purposes has been
met, any accrued municipal income tax withheld from employee qualifying wages
earned within the Municipality shall be remitted to the Municipality at the
same time that the federal tax withholding payment is due.

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the

corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
183.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
183.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.  (Ord. 2015-31.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.

remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator

withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent of the tax

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid

Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that

income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
183.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one

purpose of making the computations required in Section 183.062 of this Chapter,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal

the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit
or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
183.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

an affiliated group.

as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

            (Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-12-18.)
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator.  When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid

installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an

with the return in accordance with section
183.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
 183.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

183.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
183.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)    (1)     Every individual taxpayer who resides in this municipality
who received net profits, salaries, wages, commissions, or other personal
service compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of
this municipality, if it be made to appear that he has paid a municipal income
tax on the same income taxable under this chapter to another municipality,
shall be allowed a credit of up to one percent (1%) against the tax imposed by
this chapter on the amount so paid by him or in his/her
behalf to such other municipality.  The credit shall not exceed one percent
(1%) of the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned in such other
municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
183.081 of this Chapter.

183.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
183.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
183.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.

signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
 183.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall

as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian

support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

183.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing

the provisions of its municipal income tax.  (Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax

income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
183.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

183.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section 183.096 of this Chapter. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, the request shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state
income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  (Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
               (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
183.10 of this Chapter.

   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement.  (Ord. 2015-31. 
Passed 11-23-15.)
183.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
183.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
 183.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
183.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
183.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
183.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
183.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality.   
   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. 2015-31.  Passed 11-23-15.)
183.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
183.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
183.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
183.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

183.20  ADOPTION OF RULES .

public or any other entity or agency.
   (G)   Any person who fails to file the required initial report or occupancy
change form for each rental unit violates this section and shall be subject to

183.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income

unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other

legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.

collected shall be stated and charged separately from the rent and shown
separately on any record thereof.  The tax shall be paid by the occupant to the

   (b)   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or

      (Ord. 2005-22.  Passed 10-24-05.)
187.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month, make a
return to the Auditor, on forms provided by the Auditor, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies
during the preceding calendar month.  All claims for exemption from the tax
filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed
with the report.  At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the Auditor.  The Auditor may require further
information in the return if such information is pertinent to the collection of
the tax.  Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason.  All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter

thirty- day period shall be added for each successive thirty-day period that
the account remains delinquent.
   (c)   Fraud.  If the Auditor determines that the nonpayment of any

five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)   Interest.  In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the

187.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF AUDITOR.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Auditor shall proceed in such
manner as s/he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base
his/her estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Auditor procures such facts
and information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make a report and remittance, s/he shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter.  In case such determination is made, the Auditor shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally, or by depositing it
in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
his/her last known place of address.  The operator may within ten days after
the serving or mailing of the notice make application in writing to the Auditor
for a hearing on the amount assessed.  If an application by the operator for a
hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and
penalties, if any, determined by the Auditor, shall become final and
conclusive, and immediately due and payable.  If an application is made, the
Auditor shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in
the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax,
interest and penalties.  At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. 
After the hearing, the Auditor shall determine the proper tax to be remitted,
and shall give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days, unless an appeal is
taken as provided in Section
187.09.
(Ord. 2005-22.  Passed 10-24-05.)

Board of Tax Review (as defined in Section
187.14 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Mount Vernon, Ohio) by filing
a notice of appeal with the Auditor within fifteen days of the serving or
mailing of the determination of the tax due.  The Board shall fix a time and
place for hearing the appeal and shall give notice in writing to the operator
at his last known place of address.  The findings of the Board shall be served
upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of a notice of
hearing.  Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon
the service of notice.

the Auditor shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing therefore, stating,
under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Auditor within three years of the date of payment.  The claim
shall be on forms furnished by the Auditor.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Auditor that the person from whom the tax has been collected
was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable
by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more
than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Auditor, or when the
transient guest, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Auditor that the transient guest has been unable to obtain
a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless

direct responsibility for administration of a tax levied by a municipal
corporation on transients.
   (b)   Not later than one hundred eighty days after the effective date of

of any municipal corporation that does not impose a tax on transient on the
effective date of this section but that imposes such a tax after that date
shall establish such a board by ordinance not later than one hundred eighty

the Board that hears appeals from the city income tax division.
   (c)   Whenever the Auditor issues a decision regarding a municipal excise
tax obligation that is subject to appeal as provided in this section or in an
ordinance or regulation of the municipal corporation, the Auditor shall notify
the taxpayer at the same time of the taxpayer’s right to appeal the decision
and of the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the decision.
   (d)   Any person who is aggrieved by a decision by the Auditor and who has
filed with the municipal corporation the required returns or other documents
pertaining to the excise tax obligation at issue in the decision may appeal the
decision to the Board created pursuant to this section by filing a request with
the Board.  The request shall be in writing, shall state why the decision
should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within thirty days
after the Auditor issues the decision complained of.
   (e)   The Board shall schedule a hearing within forty-five days after

does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the Board and may be
represented by an Attorney at Law, Certified Public Accountant, or other
representative.
   (f)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Auditor’s decision or any
part of that decision.  The Board shall issue a decision on the appeal within
ninety days after the Board’s final hearing on the appeal, and send notice of
its decision by ordinary mail to the petitioner within fifteen days after
issuing the decision.  (Ord. 2005-22.  Passed 10-24-05.)
   (g)   Each Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its
transactions.  Such records are not public records available for inspection
under Ohio R.C. 149.43.  Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board
of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public
body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22.
   (h)   The Local Board of Tax Review is hereby created, which shall consist
of three members. The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be
domiciled in the Municipality. 
      (1)   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment.  One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality.  This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years.  There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority.  The board member appointed by the
top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion
of the administrative official.
      (3)   Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in Section 718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (4)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created. 
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term.  No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (7)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (i)   The Local Board of Tax Review may adopt rules and regulations
governing the conduct of its affairs that are consistent with Chapter
187 .

or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim is punishable as aforesaid
in subsection (a) hereof.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

303.991 of the Traffic Code. 
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
313.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.99)
313.05  SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
 
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
 
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.

misdemeanor.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.

endorsement of a driver's or commercial driver's license, unless and until he
surrenders to the Registrar all valid licenses issued to him by another
jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio.  No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster

at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject

(ORC 2901.11)
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony

   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."

the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which

purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the

officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit

501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
 
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
 
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of                          Maximum
Misdemeanor                      Fine
First degree                         $ 5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically    2000.00
      classified

      specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

511.01  PURPOSE.
   Although an alarm system is important as a deterrent to unlawful entry,
continued malfunctioning or employee error compromise the effectiveness of the
system.  Frequent response by the Police and Fire Departments to these false
alarms is not only expensive, but it creates a risk of injury to the responding
officer and others and a risk of damage to property.  Based upon these
considerations, the purpose of this chapter is to regulate alarm supplies,
subscribers, and users.
(Ord. 1987-04.  Passed 6-15-87.)

activated to summon the Police or the Fire Department in nonemergency
situations.  False alarms shall not include signals willfully activated by

   The complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended.  The Board may also

staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. 
Such investigations shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint.  The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Fair Housing Board.  If the Secretary
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occured, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial
conference and the persuasion with all interested parties and such
representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.  Conciliation
conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such initial
conferences shall be made public by any member of the Board or its staff unless
the parties agree thereto and in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated.  Consent agreements
shall be signed on behalf of the Fair Housing Board by its Chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)   If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the

further investigation as may be necessary.  The Board shall not dismiss such
complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to appear before
the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible to conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed.
   The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written statement of charges and
a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and
place of the hearing.  The respondent or his authorized counsel may file and
amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing date as it deems
necessary in support of its position.  The hearing shall be opened to the
public and shall be heard not less than fifteen calendar days nor more than
thirty calendar days after service of the statement of charges and summons. 
The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the
issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the
production of relevant documents and records.  The failure to comply with a
summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in
person or by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an
attorney.  The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to
cross examine witnesses shall be preserved.  All testimony and evidence shall
be given under oath or by affirmation.  The Secretary shall keep full record of
the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person,
and upon request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall
furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board
deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines that the
person complained against has violated this chapter, the Board shall, after
consultation with the Law Director in executive session, state its findings to
and cause the Law Director to prepare and issue an order under Board directive
requiring the person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful
conduct and to take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of
this chapter, with notice that if the Board, upon investigation by the
Secretary, determines that the person complained against has not, after fifteen
calendar days following service of the Board's order, complied with the order,
the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for enforcement.  The
Law Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the
name of the Fair Housing Board of the City of Mount Vernon before a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (h)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines that the
person complained against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so
state and publish its findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

533.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)
545.03  PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

   (a)   Purpose and Policy.  The Sanitary Sewer System of the City consists of
trunk, interceptors, and collection sewers laid in streets, alleys, right of
way, and easements, and a wastewater treatment plant, the locations of which
are shown upon plans and drawings filed in the Office of the City Engineer, and
all other appurtenances which are used in whole or in part in connection with
the collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater and industrial wastes;
and all other extensions, additions and improvements which may be made to such
system. Its purpose is to provide for the collection and treatment of domestic
wastewater and such industrial wastes  as are permitted by this chapter, in
order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of
the City in conformity with all applicable State and Federal laws relating
thereto, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code [U.S.C.] section
1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (Title 40 of the Code of
Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 403). The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the collection
system or Publicly Owned Treatment Works that will interfere with operation of
the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works that will pass through the Publicly Owned Treatment Works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with
the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
      (3)   To protect both Publicly Owned Treatment Works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
and 
      (6)   To enable the City to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other Federal or State laws to which the Publicly Owned Treatment Works is
subject.
   This chapter shall apply to all Users of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works.
The ordinance authorizes the issuance of individual wastewater discharge
permits or general permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and
enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires
User reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
   (b)   Administration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Director of

roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized
water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically
authorized by the Director. 
         S.   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes.
         T.   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Director
in an individual wastewater discharge permit.
         U.     Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant's effluent to fail toxicity test.
         V.     Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which
that might  cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
         W.     Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause Interference
with the POTW.
         X.   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this Section
shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged
to the POTW.
     (f)       Limitations on Wastewater Strength.
      (1)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with
the  categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Parts 405-471.
         A.    Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Director may imposeequivalent concentration or mass limits.
         B.    When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as
mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users.
         C.    When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard
is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the Director shall
impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
         D.   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
Pretreatment    Standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this
Section. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.15]
            1.   Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect
the presence of pollutants in the Industrial User's intake water in accordance
with this Section. Any Industrial User wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the  City. Upon request of the Industrial
User, the applicable calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect
credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of subsection
(f)(1)D. 2. hereof are met.
                     2.    Criteria.
               a.   Either the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards
contained in 40CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied
on a net basis; or the Industrial User demonstrates that the control system it
proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
               b.   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be
granted unless the Industrial  User demonstrates that the constituents of the
generic measure in the User's effluent are substantially similar to the
constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate
additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall
or elsewhere.
               c.    Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to
meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to a maximum value
equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to
determine eligibility for credits and compliance with Standard(s) adjusted
under this Section.
               d.   Credit shall be granted only if the User demonstrates that
the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the
POTW discharges. The City may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
         E.   When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in
terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the City
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the    
Director. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial
User meets all the conditions set forth in subsections (f)(1)E.1.a. through e.
below.
            1.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User
must:
               a.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water
   conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use
during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
               b.    Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate
to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard,
and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
               c.    Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based    on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
               d.    Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the Discharge; and
               e.    Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standards during the period  prior to the Industrial User's
request for equivalent mass limits.
            2.    An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must:
               a.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
               b.    Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the
use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
               c.    Continue to record the facility's production rates and
notify the Director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than
20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph (f)
(1)E.1.c. of this Section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the
Director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as
necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
               d.    Continue to employ the same or comparable water
   conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to
paragraphs (f)(1) E.1.a. of this Section so long as it discharges under an
equivalent mass limit.
                       3.    When developing equivalent mass limits, the
Director
               a.    Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying
the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the
Industrial User by the concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average
Standard for the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the
appropriate unit conversion factor;
               b.    Upon notification of a revised production rate, will
reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
               c.    May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the Industrial User's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual  average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation  of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment.. The Industrial
User must also be in compliance with the prohibition of bypass.
         F.    The Director may convert the mass limits of the categorical
Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
Industrial Users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Director.
         G.    Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this Section in lieu of the
   promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived.
         H.    Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average, limitations.  Where such
Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum  equivalent limitation. [Note:
See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8)]
         I.    Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
Standard shall notify the Director within two (2) business days after the User
has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly
change within the next calendar month. Any User  not notifying the Director of
such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration
limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term
average production rate. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9)]
      (2)       State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW
shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in any instance
in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or
those in this or any other applicable ordinance.
      (3)       City's Right of Revision:  The City reserves the right to
establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more
stringent Standards or Requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with
the purpose of this ordinance.
      (4)     Dilution: No User shall ever increase the use of process water,
or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on Users who are using
dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
      (5)   The Director is authorized to establish Local Limits pursuant to 40
CFR 403.5(c). 
      (6)   No user shall discharge wastewater containing concentrations of the
following enumerated materials, exceeding the following values:
 
MATERIAL            CONCENTRATION (mg/l)
Nickel              0.5
Phenols             None
Lead                0.3
Mercury             0.001
Silver              0.2
Arsenic             0.23
Barium              None
Total Phosphorus    None
Selenium            0.18
Molybdenum          0.20
Free Cyanide (CN)   0.5
Hexavalent Chromium None
Total Chromium      0.2
Copper              0.5
Zinc                1.0
Cadmium             0.1
 
The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the
POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless
indicated otherwise. The Director may impose mass limitations in addition to
the concentration-based limitations above.
      (7)   The Director may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), by
ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement Local
Limits and the requirements of Section
911.04. 
   (g)       Grease and Oil Traps and Interceptors.  For grease, oil, and
inorganic material such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors or traps shall be
provided at the User's expense when, in the opinion of the Director, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease
in excessive amounts, as specified in subsection (e)(3)M. and (e)(3)N. hereof,
or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for single-family residences, duplexes, or
other multi-unit residences unless the Utilities Commission determines there
are discharges that may create problems in the sanitary sewer.  All Users shall
also be subject to permit per Section
911.06.
      (1)   All interceptors and traps shall be of a type and capacity approved
by the Utilities Commission, and shall be located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection.  All interceptors or traps found not to
be in compliance with these guidelines shall be modified or replaced.  In the
maintaining of these interceptors the owner shall be responsible for the proper
removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal which are subject to
review by the Director.  Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by the owner's personnel must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms.
      (2)       The introduction of additives containing surfactants and/or
enzymes into the trap, interceptor, or sanitary sewer is prohibited.  Food
services wishing to use aqueous suspensions of grease-consuming bacteria for
grease control shall submit a written request to the Director and must receive
written approval prior to their use.
      (3)    Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
 
   (h)       Pretreatment Facilities. Industrial Users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve
limitations as specified by this chapter and the Federal Pretreatment
Regulations within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the
City, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated and maintained at the User's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the City for review, and shall be acceptable to the City before
constructing the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the
provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
City prior to the User's initiation of the changes. 
   (i)   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Director may require Users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the User's compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
      (2)   The Director may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.  (Ord.
2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16; Ord. 2019-38.  Passed 12-23-19.)
911.05  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES AND SPILLS.
   (a)   Accidental Discharges.  Each User shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances
established by this chapter. If required by the Director, the User shall
prepare, submit and maintain a Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure
Plan. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the User's cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Director and City Engineer for review, and
shall be approved by the Utilities Commission before construction of the
facility. Each existing user shall complete its plan and submit same to the 
Director within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this chapter. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the User
from responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet requirements of
this chapter. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of any accidental
or Slug Discharge, as required by this chapter; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug
Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
         A.     In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause
potential problems for the City Of Mount Vernon POTW and the receiving water,
the User shall immediately telephone and notify the City Of Mount Vernon POTW
of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective action. A
written notification containing the same information shall follow within three
working days. This notification shall be followed, within fifteen days of the
date of    occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the causes of
the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future 
occurrence. Such notification will not relieve users of liability for any 
fines provided for in Section
911.09, or for any expense, loss or damage to the sewage works, or treatment
process, or for any fines imposed on the City on account thereof.
           B.     In order that employees of Users are informed of these
requirements, Users shall make available to their employees copies of this
chapter together with such other wastewater information and notices which may
be furnished by the Utilities Commission or Director from time to time directed
toward more effective water pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and
permanently posted on the User's bulletin board advising employees whom to call
in case of an accidental discharge in violation of this chapter.
         C.   Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for persistent
or    deleterious wastes to the User's plumbing or drainage system shall be
eliminated. Where such action is impractical or unreasonable the User shall
appropriately label such entry points to warn against discharge of such wastes
in violation of the chapter.
            (Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16; Ord. 2019-38.  Passed 12-23-19.)
911.06  INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (a)   The Director.  May require any Users to obtain individual wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
   (b)   Wastewater Analysis.  When requested by the Director, a User must
submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within
60 days of the request. The  Director is authorized to prepare a form for this
purpose and may periodically require Users to update this information.
   (c)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit and Pretreatment.  No User
shall discharge industrial wastewater or other incompatible wastes, either
directly or indirectly, into the POTW without first obtaining approval and/or a
written permit from the Utilities Commission, after the Utilities Commission
has ascertained that the discharge of waste in the particular instance is not
in violation of this chapter and the discharge shall receive satisfactory
pretreatment as may be required by this chapter. Industries classified as
Significant Industrial Users and others as deemed necessary by the Utilities
Commission shall obtain the written permit. Obtaining an approval and/or a
discharge permit does not relieve the User from its obligation to obtain other
permits required by federal, state or local law. Upon due notification and for
just cause, the Utilities Commission has the right to revoke or suspend any
permit issued in accordance with this chapter.  Reissuance of a discharge
permit shall be at the discretion of the Utilities Commission, and may be
subject to such conditions as deemed appropriate.
   (d)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Disclosure.  All  Users proposing to
connect to or to discharge sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes to the
sewage works shall complete and file with the Utilities Commission, a permit
application in the form prescribed by the Utilities Commission. Existing Users
shall file the necessary forms within thirty (30) days after receiving an
official request by the Director to do so, and proposed new users shall file
its forms at least ninety (90) days prior to connecting to the sewage works. No
discharge permit shall be issued unless and until the User has submitted the
following required information:

average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported.
         D.   The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall
be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in Section
911.07(h). Where the Standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution
prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as required by the
Director or the applicable Standards to determine compliance with the Standard.
         E.     Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in
911.07(i).
        (6)   Disclosure of the nature and concentration of any pollutants or
materials     prohibited by this chapter in the discharge, together with a
statement regarding whether or not compliance is being achieved with this
chapter on a consistent basis and if not, whether additional operation and

persons with notice of final permit decisions. Upon notice by the Utilities
Commission, any person, including the User, may petition to appeal the terms of
the Permit within thirty days (30) of the notice. All such appeals are subject
to the following conditions:
      (1)   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to
be a waiver of the appeal.
      (2)   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the Permit
provisions objected to, the reason for this objection, and the alternative
condition, if any, it seeks to be placed in the Permit.
      (3)   The Permit shall be in effect and shall not be stayed pending
reconsideration by the Utilities Commission. If, after considering the
petition, the Utilities Commission determines that reconsideration is proper,
the Utilities Commission shall remand the Permit for reissuance. Those Permit
provisions being reconsidered shall be stayed pending reissuance.
      (4)   If the Utilities Commission fails to act within thirty (30) days, a
request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. The Utilities
Commission's decision not to reconsider a final Permit shall be considered
final administrative action for purposes of judicial review.
      (5)   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final Individual
Wastewater Discharge Permit conditions must do so by filing an appeal with the
court of competent jurisdiction.
   (j)   Permit Transfer.  Wastewater Discharge Permits are issued to a
specific User for a specific operation and are not assignable to another User
or transferable to any other location, without the prior written approval of
the Utilities Commission. Individual wastewater discharge permits may be
transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least
sixty (60) days advance notice to the Director and the Director approves the
individual wastewater discharge permit. The notice to the Director must include
a written certification by the new owner or operator which:
      (1)   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent
to change the facility's operations and processes;
      (2)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
      (3)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
individual wastewater discharge permit.
   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the individual
wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
   (k)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation or Suspension.  The
Utilities Commission may revoke or suspend an individual wastewater discharge
permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
      (1)   Failure to notify the Director of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
      (2)   Failure to provide prior notification to the Director of changed
conditions pursuant to this chapter;
      (3)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application;
      (4)   Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements;
      (5)   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
      (6)   Refusing to allow the Director timely access to the facility
premises and records;
      (7)   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
      (8)   Failure to pay fines;
      (9)   Failure to pay sewer charges; access to the facility premises and
records;
      (10)   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
      (11)   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application;
      (12)   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility; or
      (13)   Violation of any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter. Individual wastewater
discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of
business ownership. All individual wastewater discharge permits issued to a
User are void upon the issuance of a new individual wastewater discharge permit
to that User.
   (l)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance.  A User with an
expiring individual wastewater discharge permit shall apply for individual
wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit
application, a minimum of ninety (90) days, but not more than one hundred
twenty (120) days, prior to the expiration of the User's existing individual
wastewater discharge permit.
   (m)   Regulation of Waste Received from Other Jurisdictions.  If another
municipality, jurisdiction, or User located outside the City contributes
wastewater to the POTW, the City shall enter into an inter- jurisdiction
agreement with the contributing User or jurisdiction.  Prior to entering into
an agreement, the Utilities Commission shall request the following information
from the contributing municipality, jurisdiction, or User:
      (1)   An inventory of all Users located within the contributing
municipality or     jurisdiction that are discharging to the POTW; and
      (2)   A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged to
the POTW by the contributing municipality;
      (3)   Such other information as the Director may deem necessary.
   (n)   An Inter-municipal or Inter-jurisdictional Agreement Shall Contain the
Following Conditions.
      (1)   A requirement for the contributing municipality or jurisdiction to
adopt a sewer    use ordinance which is at least as stringent as this chapter
and Local Limits, including required Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMRs) which
are at least as stringent as those set out in this chapter. The requirement
shall specify that such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to
reflect changes made to the City's ordinance or Local Limits;
      (2)   A requirement for the contributing municipality or jurisdiction to
submit a revised User inventory on at least an annual basis;
      (3)   A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation
activities, including individual wastewater discharge permit issuance,
inspection and sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing
municipality; which of these activities will be conducted by the Director; and
which of these activities will be conducted jointly by the contributing
municipality or jurisdiction and the Director;
      (4)   A requirement for the contributing municipality, jurisdiction or
User to provide the Director with access to all information that the
contributing municipality or jurisdiction obtains as part of its pretreatment
activities;
      (5)   Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing
municipality's, jurisdiction's, or User's wastewater at the point where it
discharges to the POTW;
      (6)   Requirements for monitoring the contributing discharge;
      (7)   A provision ensuring the Director access to the facilities of Users
located within the contributing municipality's jurisdictional boundaries for
the  purpose of inspection, sampling, and any other duties deemed necessary by
the Director; and
      (8)    A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms
of the inter-municipal, inter-jurisdictional, or User agreement.
   (o)   Best Management Practices.
      (1)   BMP Permits may be issued to groups of low flow dischargers that
have similar process and discharge similar types of wastewater.
      (2)   BMP Permits may contain terms, conditions, effluent limits, 
pretreatment standards and other requirements as deemed necessary to meet the
objectives of Chapter
911.
      (3)   Any violations of the BMP Permit terms, conditions, effluent
limits, pretreatment standards and requirements shall be deemed a violation of
Chapter
911.

911.07  REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a
categorical Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
Categorical Industrial Users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the Director a report which contains the
information listed in paragraph B, below. At least ninety (90) days prior to
commencement of their discharge, New Sources, and sources that become
Categorical Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of inapplicable
categorical Standard, shall submit to [the Superintendent] a report which
contains the information listed in paragraph (1.), below. A New Source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical Standards. A New Source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
      (1)   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
All    information required in
911.06(d)(1) through 
911.06(d)(4).

      (1)   The User shall provide the information required in
911.06 (b) through (e).
      (2)   The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
      (3)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no  pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40
CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted
to the Control Authority;
      (4)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
911.07(h) and (i).
      (5)   The Director may allow the submission of a baseline report which
utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
      (6)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is  representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
Discharges to the POTW.
   (b)   Compliance Certification.  A statement, reviewed by the User's
Authorized Representative as defined in
911.02(5) and certified by a qualified professional,  indicating whether
Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (c)   Compliance Schedule.  If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule by which the
User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this Section must meet the requirements set out in
911.07(e).
   (d)   Signature and Report Certification.  All baseline monitoring reports
must be certified in accordance with
911.07(o) and signed.
   (e)   Compliance Schedule Progress Reports.  The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by
911.07(1):
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to meet the
applicable Pretreatment Standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      (3)   The User shall submit a progress report to the Director no later
than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date
of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the User to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Administrator Director.
   (f)   Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline.  Within ninety  (90) days following the date for final compliance
with applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case of a New
Source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any User subject to such Pretreatment    Standards and Requirements shall
submit to the Director a report containing the information described in
911.06(d) and
 911.07(1)(a). For Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in
911.04(f) [40 CFR 403.6(c)], this report shall contain a reasonable measure of
the User's  long-term production rate. For all other Users subject to
categorical Pretreatment  Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in  accordance with
911.07(o). All sampling will be done in conformance with
911.07(i).
   (g)   Periodic Monitoring Compliance Reports.  Any User subject to a
Pretreatment Standard set forth in this chapter shall submit to the Director
within ninety (90) days following the final compliance date of such
Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a New User, within ninety (90) days
after commencement of the discharge to the City's  sewage works, and thereafter
during the months of June and December, unless required  more frequently by the
Director, a report indicating the nature and concentration, of prohibited or
regulated substances in its discharge which are limited by the Pretreatment
Standards hereof. In addition, this report shall include a record of all
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting
period. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided
however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Director may
accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques.
The Director, for good cause shown considering such factors as local high or
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may
authorize the submission of months other than those specified above. In cases
where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit
documentation required by the Director or the Pretreatment Standard necessary
to determine the compliance status of the User.
      (1)   Reports of Users shall contain all results of sampling and analysis
of the    discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where required by the Director. The frequency of monitoring
by the User shall be as prescribed in the applicable Pretreatment  Standard of
this chapter or the Individual Discharge Permit.  All pollutant analysis,
including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR,
Part 136 and amendments hereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical Pretreatment Standard.  Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a
sampling and analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis
Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April
1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical
procedures approved by the Director of the USEPA. Determination of the
character and concentration of the industrial wastes shall be made by the user
responsible for the discharge, or his qualified agent as approved by the
Utilities Commission. The results of the analysis shall be reported to the
Director on a periodic basis on forms provided by the Director.  The City makes
its own analysis on the wastes and these determinations shall be binding as a
basis for charges, except as follows;
         A.   In case the analyses performed by the User and the City result in
   substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the User to
collect samples at the same time the City collects its own samples. The results
of the analyses on the samples collected by the City and the User shall be
compared using the same testing procedures and the differences negotiated.
      (2)   Reports shall state whether the applicable Pretreatment Standards
or Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional facilities and/or pretreatment is necessary to gain compliance with
applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements.
      (3)   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting.  If a User's
sampling data indicates a violation, the User shall notify the Director within
twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violations as per 40 CFR 403.12(g)
(2) and amendments thereto. The User shall resample and submit to the Director
the results of the resampling within thirty (30) days of  becoming aware of the
initial violation. Any violation of this chapter revealed by the Industrial
User's sampling shall be considered to continue until subsequent sampling shows
the results to be in compliance.
      (4)   Reports required shall be based on data outlined during the period
covered by the report and on an amount of sampling appropriate for that User as
per 40 CFR 403.12(g)(3) and amendments thereto.
      (5)   Results of additional monitoring at Director designated monitoring
sites beyond the minimum required shall be included in the reports required
during the same period as per 40 CFR(g)(5) and amendments thereto.
      (6)   Wastewater Volume Determinations. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial waste charges shall be the metered water consumption of
the person as shown in the records of water meter readings maintained by the
City, except as herein provided in this section.
         A.   If the User discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the City water
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer, the User
shall install and maintain at the User's expense water meters of a type
approved by the Director for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from those other sources.
         B.     The User discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
may install and maintain at the User's expense metering devices for determining
the volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial waste charges would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a
type acceptable to the Director.
         C.     The Director may require the installation of devices for
measuring the volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records.
         D.     Any metering device for determining the volume of waste
discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the
User. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed
without the consent of the Director.
   (h)   Analytical Requirements.  All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
   (i)   Sample Collection.
      (1)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based
on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
         A.   Except as indicated in subsection (i)(1)B. and C. below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period maybe composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be  authorized by
the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with Instantaneous Limits.
         B.     Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
         C.     For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-
day compliance reports required in
911.07(1) and (f) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling
data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, The Utilities Commission may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by paragraphs
911.07(g) [(40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the User is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
         D.     All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with
911.07(o).
         E.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times.    The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
         F.     If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Director, using the procedures prescribed in
911.07(i), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (j)   Date of Receipt of Reports.  Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (k)   Reports of Changed Conditions.  Each User must notify the Director of
any significant changes to the User's operations or system which might alter
the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days
before the change.
      (1)   The Director may require the User to submit such information as    
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
911.06.
      (2)   The Director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit
under
911.06(l) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
911.06(h) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
   (l)   Reports of Potential Problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and
notify the Director of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the User.
      (2)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall,
unless waived by the Director, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (l)(1) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Director
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug
Discharge.
   (m)   Reports from Unpermitted Users.  All Users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Director as the Director may require.

      (3)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
User at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the User.
      (4)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the User's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (s)   Recordkeeping.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained  pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this chapter, any additional records of    information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management  Practices.  Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of
the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the

has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director.
   (t)   Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance.  The Director shall
   publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public    notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list
of the Users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in
Significant Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements. The term Significant Noncompliance shall be applicable to all
Significant Industrial Users (or any other Industrial User that violates
subsections (t)(3), (4), or (5) hereof and shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six- (6-) month period exceed
(by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits.
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for each pollutant parameter during a six- (6-) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including

911.08  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notification of Violation; Administrative Adjustment.
        (1)   Whenever the Director finds that any user has violated, or 
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or  Requirement, or is engaged in conduct which justifies termination of a 
wastewater treatment service, pursuant to Section
911.08(c), the Utilities Commission may serve or cause to be served upon such
User,  a  written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation.
      (2)   Within ten (10) days of the date of receipt of the notice, the User
shall respond in writing to the Utilities Commission, advising of its position
with respect to the allegations. This response shall include an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof
and include specific required actions.  Submission of such a plan in no way
relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the
authority of the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or
any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
Thereafter the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations
and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (b)   Orders.  The Utilities Commission may issue Orders to any User as
deemed necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. No
User shall violate any Order issued to that User. Orders shall be served upon
the affected user directly or by certified mail. Any User issued an Order by
the Utilities Commission may appeal that Order according to Section
911.08(d). The Utilities Commission may issue, but is not limited to the
following type of Orders.
      (1)   Consent orders. The Utilities Commission may enter into Consent
Orders establishing an agreement with any User responsible for non-compliance.
Such orders shall include specific action to be taken by the User to correct
the non-compliance within a specified time period.
      (2)   Compliance orders. When the Director finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate this any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard of Requirement, the Utilities Commission may issue an
Order to that User, directing that the User come into compliance within a
specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices 
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User.
      (3)   Cease and desist orders. When the Director finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an individual
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur, the
Utilities Commission may issue an Order to cease and desist all such violations
and direct those Users in non-compliance to;
         A.   Immediately comply with all the requirements; and
         B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
 
         (c)   Show Cause Hearing.  The Utilities Commission may order a User
which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Commission and show
cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be
served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User.  A show
cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the User.
   The Commission Chairman shall conduct the hearing and take evidence. At the
hearing, all testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded. The transcript
shall be made available to the public or any party to the hearing upon full
payment of the costs of the transcript. Within ten (10) days of the hearing,
the Director shall transmit to the Utilities Commission written recommendations
for enforcement action against the discharger, together with a written report
of the evidence and a complete transcript of the hearing. Within thirty (30)
days of receipt of the recommendations of the Director, the Utilities
Commission shall impose whatever enforcement action it deems necessary and
appropriate to accomplish the purpose and policy of this chapter. The Utilities
Commission shall give written notice to the User of the date, time, and place
of each meeting of the Utilities Commission at which the recommendations of the
Director shall be considered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
chapter the City and the User may enter into an agreement to correct the
violations and to accomplish the purpose and policy of this chapter, subject to
the following:
      (1)   The agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Director and
the agent or officer of the User. 
      (2)   If the Director has transmitted his recommendations to the
Utilities Commission, the agreement must be approved by the Utilities
Commission.
      (3)   The agreement must provide that all violations of this chapter will
be corrected.
      (4)   All costs of the hearing to show cause and all costs incurred by
the City must be paid in full by the User; and, 
      (5)   The User must agree to any additional reporting requirements that
the Utilities Commission deems necessary to protect the POTW from further
misuse.
   Any User who fails to appear at a Show Cause Hearing shall be deemed to have
agreed to whatever action is taken by the Utilities Commission as a result of
the Show Cause Hearing. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the User in
accordance with applicable local or State law.
   (d)   Right of Appeal.  Any User or any interested party shall have the
right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the Utilities
Commission on any matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a
prompt written reply. Request shall be filed within ten (10) days of action
resulting from this chapter. In the event that such inquiry is by a User and
deals with matters of performance or compliance with this chapter for which
enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt
of a User's request, shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipts of
the aforesaid written reply. The Utilities Commission shall convene a hearing
to discuss the matter within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request. The
Utilities Commission may grant continuances if deemed necessary. A written
decision on the appeal shall be issued within ten (10) days of the hearing.
Appeal of any final judicial order entered pursuant to this chapter may be
taken in accordance with local and State law.
   (e)   Emergency Suspension of Service.  The Utilities Commission may
immediately suspend a User's discharge, after informal notice to the User,
whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Commission
may also immediately suspend a User's discharge, after notice and opportunity
to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow
the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Utilities Commission that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings of this chapter are initiated
against the User.
      (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under this chapter.
   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any Emergency.
   (f)   Termination of Discharge.  In addition to the provisions Section
911.06(k), any User who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section
911.04.
   Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under this chapter why the proposed
action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Utilities Commission
shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the User.
   (g)   Publication of Users in Significant Non-Compliance.  The Director
shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by The City of Mount
Vernon POTW, a list of the Users which, at any time during the previous twelve
(12) months, were in Significant Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment
Standards and Requirements. The term Significant Noncompliance shall be
applicable to all Significant Industrial Users (or any other Industrial User
that violates subsections (g)(3), (4) or (8) of this Section) and shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six- (6-) month period exceed
(by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits as defined in Section
 911.04;
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for each pollutant parameter during a six- (6-) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including
Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Section
911.04 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Section
911.04 (Daily Maximum, long-term average, Instantaneous Limit, or narrative
standard) that the Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with
other discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including endangering the
health of The City Of Mount Vernon POTW personnel or the general public;
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in Water and Wastewater
Commission exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a

any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self-
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (8)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices, which Director determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
   (h)   Administrative Fines.  When the Director finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Utilities Commission may fine such
User in an amount not to exceed one thousand ($1,000) dollars per day. Such
fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
      (1)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after sixty (60)
calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent
(1%) per month. A lien against the User's property shall be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
      (2)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Utilities Commission to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a
request has merit, the Commission may convene a hearing on the matter. In the
event the User's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User. The Commission may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
      (3)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   (i)   Recovery of Costs Incurred by the City.  Any User violating any of the
provisions of this chapter or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a
deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the City's POTW shall be
liable to the City for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or
discharge, including any EPA fines occurred by the City as a result of the
violation. The Utilities Commission may bill the User for any cleaning, repair,
or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the
assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter enforceable under
the provisions of Section

911.12  PVC SEWER PIPE.
   (a)       Specifications.   The installation and use of polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) sanitary sewer pipe shall be permitted within the City sewer district
provided that such pipe meets the following specifications:
      (1)       Quality of pipe.
         A.       Standards.  PVC sewer pipe and fittings shall conform to ASTM
D3034 or D3033. The Standard Thermoplastic Pipe Dimension Ratio (SDR) (average
outside diameter divided by minimum wall) shall be as shown on the plans. All
pipe spigots shall have a home mark to facilitate joint closure.
         B.       Fittings.  PVC fittings shall be factory made and provided
with joints of proper design to connect to the pipe, or approved adapters shall
be furnished to connect the pipe to the fittings. Adapters shall be provided
for connection to pipes of different materials. All joints and fittings shall
be formed to provide as nearly as practical a leakfree and easily assembled
system.
         C.       Certificate.  A manufacturer's certificate that the PVC
material and pipe were manufactured and tested in accordance with the
appropriate ASTM specification shall be furnished to the Engineer prior to
installation of the pipe.
         D.       Straightness.  Pipe intended to be straight shall have a
maximum    deviation from straightness of one-sixteenth of an inch per lineal
foot when measured in accordance with ASTM D2122.
         E.       Inspection. All pipe and fittings will be inspected by the
Engineer or his    or her authorized representative immediately prior to
installation, and all rejected pieces must be completely removed from the
project. Pipe acceptable to the Engineer shall be substituted for rejected
pieces at the contractor's expense. No repairs of pipe or fittings will be
allowed; undamaged lengths of straight pipe may be salvaged by neatly sawing
off the damaged portion of the pipe.
      (2)   Pipe joints.  PVC sewer pipe joints shall be elastomerically
gasketed. The gasketed joint shall be so designed that when assembled, the
elastomeric gasket inside the bell is compressed radially on the pipe spigot to
form a positive seal.    The joint shall be so designed to avoid displacement
of the gasket when installed in accordance with the manufacturer's
recommendation. All gaskets shall be molded into a circular form or extruded to
the proper section and then spliced into circular form and shall consist of a
properly vulcanized high-grade elastomeric compound. The basic polymer shall be
natural rubber, synthetic elastomer or a blend of both. The gasket shall
provide an adequate compressive force so as to affect a positive seal under all
combinations of joint tolerances. The  gasket shall be the only element
depended upon to make the joint flexible and watertight.
      (3)       Installation. The following specifications for the installation
of PVC sanitary sewer pipe shall supplement and/or modify general installation
specifications for sewers.
         A.       Exposure to sunlight. Care shall be taken to protect PVC pipe
from prolonged exposure to heat or direct sunlight (ultraviolet rays).
         B.       Connections. Connections to pipe of different materials shall
be made with the proper adapters.
         C.       Closures.
 
   (b)       Stubs and Services.  All closures at the ends of stubs and house
services shall be made by the use of a PVC cap, solvent cemented to the spigot
end of the stub. A sufficient length of stub should be installed to permit
cutting off the closure and extending the stub in the future.
   (c)       Wyes and Tees. All closures at the ends of wyes and tees shall be
made by solvent cementing a length of PVC pipe to the wye or tee and solvent
cementing a PVC cap to the spigot end of the PVC pipe. A sufficient length of

913.07  SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   The following User Charges shall be paid by all classes of users, and
the charges shall be based on each 100 cu. ft. of flow being discharged to the
sanitary sewer system.
 
User        Effective
Class       April 1, 2017
All Classes $4.90
   (b)   Wastewater Service Availability Charge. (W.W.S.A.C.)
      (1)   This service charge shall apply to all customers having access to
the City wastewater utility. This service charge shall include the first 400
cu. ft. of water usage as a minimum. The W.W.S.A.C. for all meter sizes shall
change when there is an increase in the wastewater rate schedule and shall
reflect the same amount of percent increase.
      (2)   Each meter size is assigned a capacity factor. The meter size and
the capacity factors are shown in the following table:
 
METER SIZE (inches) CAPACITY FACTOR
5/8 & 3/4           1.00
1                   1.35
1 ½                3.10

8                   87.20
      (3)   These factors will be applied using the 5/8 and 3/4 inch meter size
as the basis (1200 cu. ft. times the base wastewater rate).
      (4)   These service charges are in addition to the consumption charges
based on the wastewater rate schedule.
   (c)   Minimum Charge Per Billing Period or Part Thereof.
      (1)   The minimum charge per single unit for any billing period or part
thereof shall in no event be less than the wastewater service availability
charge (W.W.S.A.C.) per billing cycle.
      (2)   When the City's sanitary sewer has been available for ninety days
to improved lots, whether connected or not, the minimum charge shall apply and
be due and payable each and every billing cycle.
   (d)   Multi-Units.  The minimum charge for multi-units shall be based on the
wastewater service availability charge for a 5/8"-3/4" meter, times the number
of units.
   (e)   Multi-Unit Change.  A unit change may be granted upon a written
request to the Director, stating the changes that have been made to the multi-
units served by the Utility. After an inspection by a representative of the
Water and Wastewater Department the Director will make the decision upon the
request for a unit change.
   (f)   Terms of Payment. The rates set forth are net and apply only in the
event all accounts for water and wastewater service are paid on or before the

does not include any bills incurred by a previous owner. All unpaid wastewater
bills shall be assessed as a tax lien against the property involved,
collectible according to law.
   (h)   Waiver of Minimum Charges. An owner may request the waiver of the
minimum charges upon written request to the Director. The request may be
granted provided the following requirements and conditions exist.
      (1)   An improved lot, that has been supplied with a sewer tap, must have
been vacated and the structure removed.
      (2)   If an improved lot has more than one tap, the additional tap(s)
must be  discontinued.
   In receiving a waiver of minimum charges, the owner of such property shall
agree to relinquish any and all rights to the tap. If in the event the owner of
the property would later request service to the discontinued tap, he shall be
required to reapply for a new tap and be charged the current permit and tap
charges. All cost will be borne by the owner of such property.
   (i)   Each industry discharging to the sanitary sewer system shall have
completed and filed with the City an Industrial Waste Questionnaire containing
pertinent information as to quality of flow, characteristics of discharged
wastewater, etc., New Industries shall file a fully executed questionnaire with
the City prior to being issued a sewer permit. 
   (j)   When a premises is supplied either in whole or in part with water from
wells or any source other than a public water supply, such well or source of
supply shall be registered in writing with the Department. The owner of the
premises shall install and maintain at his expense, a meter acceptable to the
Department on all such supplies, and the quantity of water used to determine
the service charges shall be the quantity as measured by the meter. If the
meter is not installed within six months from the date of notification in
writing by the Commission, the owner or other users of the premises shall be
billed double the minimum charge.
   (k)   Where an auxiliary meter is required for the proper determination of
water subject to the service charges, such meter shall be installed only after
approval has been granted by the Director. Such meter shall be installed, owned
and maintained by the property owner. Venturi meters, flumes, weirs and other
methods of measuring flow shall be used only when authorized by the Director.
Meters which will be approved are as follows:
      (1)   Meters purchased from the Department.
      (2)   Meters equal or similar to subsection (k)(1) hereof, purchased
elsewhere and tested by the Department.
      (3)   Crest or turbine type meters of two-inch size and over, to be used
where it is established the particular meter is under full head at all times;
provided such meters are tested and approved for large constant flows by the
Department.
      (4)   Existing private meters now in place, may be continued in use on a
conditional basis. If such meters are suspected of faulty registration, they
are subject to a test, when so ordered by the Director.
   Other meters shall be tested by the manufacturer of the meter and a
certificate of the test shall be furnished to the Director. Such meters shall
not be used without the written approval of the Director.
   It is understood that where an auxiliary meter has been installed, such
meter shall not be removed without the approval of the Director.
   (l)   All meters shall be installed in accordance with the standards, rules
and regulations of the Department.

distribution system, and such meters are set behind the primary water supply
meter, the aforementioned standards, rules and regulations may be modified or
waived by the Director.
   (m)   Fire protection service branches shall be exempt from all service
charges except for water used for purposes other than fire protection and basic
fireline service fees.
   (n)   Where a sanitary or combined sewer in the area served by the City is
available to any lot, parcel of land, building or premises which is improved,
it is a conclusive presumption that wastewater from such lot, parcel of land,
building or premises which is improved is discharged into such sewer, and the
owner shall be billed the service charges as provided herein. Any lot, parcel
of land, building or premises abutting a street, alley or easement in which
there is a public sanitary or combined sewer shall be deemed to have available
access to a sanitary sewer, and the owner or other users of such real property
shall connect to the sewer within six months from the date the owner is
notified in writing by the Commission that the sewer is made available for use
to their property. In the event the owner or other users of the real property
are not connected on such date, the minimum charge specified under subsection
(b) hereof shall be imposed upon the property.
(Ord. 2017-09.  Passed 3-27-17.)
913.08  BILLING AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   The service charges, shall be for a period of one quarter of a year,

914.01  OTHER RELATED PROVISIONS INCORPORATED.
   (a)   This chapter is cross referenced with Chapter
913 (User Charge and all pertinent provisions of such chapter shall be
considered a part of this chapter.
   (b)   All provisions of Chapter
911 (Sewer Use) shall be considered a part of this chapter in so far as the
various sections are applicable. 
(Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)
914.02  PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish extra strength surcharges for
wastewaters exceeding the strength of normal strength wastewater as defined
herein, and to establish an industrial waste surveillance charge to cover the
cost of monitoring all industrial wastes discharged to the sanitary sewer
system. 
(Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)
914.03  EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGE PAYMENT.
   Every person, firm or corporation whose premises are served by a sewer
connection which discharges industrial wastes, water or other liquids, other
than normal strength wastewater, either directly or indirectly into the
sanitary sewer system under the jurisdiction of the Water and Sewer Department
shall be charged and shall pay an extra strength surcharge in addition to the
sewer service charges for normal strength wastewater specified in Chapter
913. 
(Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)
914.04  NORMAL STRENGTH WASTEWATER DEFINED.
   "Normal strength sewage or wastes" as defined for the purpose of determining
surcharge means wastewater having an average daily suspended solids
concentration of not more than 250 mg/l, an average BOD5 concentration of not
more than 200 mg/l and not containing any of the characteristic in excess of
the limitations as prohibited and established by Section
911.04 (e) and (f).    (Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)
914.05  BASIS OF SURCHARGES.
   (a)   Surcharges shall be determined on the basis of the following
constituents of the wastewater that are in excess of normal strength
wastewater:
      (1)   Total Suspended Solids (Nonfilterable Residue).
      (2)   BOD, 5-Days at 20 degrees C.
   (b)   When any or all of the total suspended solids or BOD5 of a wastewater
accepted for admission to the City's sanitary sewer system exceeds the value of
the above specified constituents for normal strength wastewater, the amount of
the treatment surcharge to be paid will be based on the cost per pound of
removing the excess quantity of each constituent. 
(Ord.  2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)
914.06  ESTABLISHMENT OF SURCHARGES.
   (a)   Strength surcharges are hereby established as follows:
         Constituent      Rate Per Pound   
      (1)   Suspended solids      $0.21   
      (2)   BOD, 5 days.         $0.25   
   (b)   An industrial waste surveillance charge is hereby established of fifty
dollars ($50.00) per quarter for each connection discharging industrial wastes
to the sanitary sewer system. Where it has been reported that no industrial
wastes are being discharged, this charge shall be levied only once per year to
cover the cost of verifying such report. In all other cases, the charge shall
be levied quarterly. The moneys collected from this charge shall be used to
cover the cost of making surveys, record keeping and occasional analytical work
necessary for verification of owner reported results. 
(Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)
914.07  ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Funds received from the strength surcharges and the industrial waste
surveillance charges shall be deposited in the Sewer Fund.
   (b)   Each industry discharging to the sanitary sewer system shall have
completed and filed with the City an industrial waste questionnaire containing
pertinent information as to quantity of flow, characteristics of discharged
wastewater, etc., and this information, which has been used to determine
required sewer service charges authorized by Chapter
913, will also be used to determine billings for extra strength surcharges for
the first quarter following the effective date of this section. Subsequent
billings will be based on revised information obtained from quarterly updated
reports or from other sources of information or records. New industries shall
file a fully executed questionnaire with the City prior to being issued a sewer
permit.
   (c)   In connection with the administering of this chapter, reference is
made to Chapter
911 and specifically those sections pertaining to control manholes, wastewater
volume determination, sampling and monitoring and analyses.
   (d)   The results of routine sampling and analysis by the owner will be used
to determine the surcharges; however, the Department may, at any period or time
and of such duration and in such manner as the Department may elect, determine
the strength of the discharged wastewater for purposes of verification. If the
owner fails to file the necessary quarterly reports, the strength determined by
the Department's analysis will be used to determine the amount of the
surcharges. Similarly, the surcharges shall be applied to the total metered
water consumption if the owner fails to file the required quarterly reports.
   (e)   If necessary, the Department shall have the right to enter and set up,
on company property, such devices as are necessary to conduct a gauging and
sampling operation and to begin such operation without advance notice to the
company or owner. While performing the work, the Department shall observe all
safety rules applicable to the premises as established by the company.
   (f)   Where a company has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry onto such company's premises is
granted, the company shall either make necessary arrangements with their
security guards that upon showing proper identification personnel from the
Department will be permitted to enter, without delays, for the purpose of
obtaining samples (grab or composite) of wastes being discharged at the various
sampling points; or the company shall install suitable gauging and sampling
manholes outside the security limits which manholes will at all times be
immediately accessible to Department personnel.
   (g)   If a person, firm or corporation disagrees with the analysis on which
the surcharges are based, he may request, in writing, an additional sampling
and analysis which shall be conducted in a manner acceptable to the Director.
The requestor shall be billed for an additional surveillance charge in order to
cover the cost of such additional sampling and analysis.
   (h)   Where certain types of business and industrial users discharge clear
uncontaminated water, if such users shall install and have in operation
equipment to dispose of or divert such waters from entering the sanitary sewer
systems, they shall be exempt from payment of surcharges for the water so
disposed of or diverted. When the equipment is installed and in operation, the
owner shall install a meter or meters at his expense to measure the amount of
water so disposed of or diverted.
   (i)   If the Director finds that it is not practicable to measure such water
by meters, he shall determine the volume of wastewater in any manner or method
as he may find practicable, in order to arrive at the percentage of metered
water entering the sanitary sewer system, and the quantity of water used to
determine the surcharges shall be that percentage so determined. Where
applicable, the sanitary flow from industry shall be considered equal to
fifteen gallons per day per employee.
   (j)   On or before July 1 of 1978, and each year thereafter on or before
July 1, the Director shall submit to the Safety Service Director a recommended
system of extra strength surcharges and industrial waste surveillance charge.
If approved, the Director shall submit the schedule of charges to Council on
the first regular meeting in October, for ratification and incorporation into
the City ordinances. The system shall be in accordance with the following
requirements:
      (1)   Strength Surcharges. The cost of treating and handling the extra
strength     constituents of BOD5,suspended solids and phosphorous shall be
determined and reported in the schedule at a cost per pound.
      (2)   Industrial Waste Surveillance Charge. The cost shall be determined
by calculating the actual cost of gathering samples, testing and reporting the
results of analysis and distributing the cost proportionately to the
appropriate customers. 
         (Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)
914.08  REJECTION OR PRETREATMENT.
   (a)   In cases where the character of wastewater or industrial waste from
any manufacturing plant, building or premises is such that it will damage the
sanitary sewerage system, or cannot be treated satisfactorily in the sewerage
system, the Director has, and shall use, the authority to compel such users to
dispose of such waste otherwise and prevent it from entering the system.
   (b)   In cases where the character of the wastewater or industrial waste
from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that
it imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sanitary sewerage system greater
than that imposed by the normal wastewater entering the sewerage system, the
Director may, if he deems advisable, compel such manufacturing or industrial
plant, building or premises to pretreat such wastewater in such manner as he
shall specify before discharging such wastewater into the sewerage system.
(Ord.  2016-21.  Passed 11-28-16.)

W.S.A.C. for all meter sizes shall change when there is an increase in the
block rate schedule and shall reflect the same amount of percent increase.
   Each meter size is assigned a capacity factor based on the American Water
Works Association's maximum flow criteria.  The meter size and the capacity
factors are shown in the following table:
 
METER SIZE  CAPACITY FACTOR
5/8" & 3/4" 1.00
1"          2.50
1 ½"       5.00
2"          8.00
3"          16.75
4"          27.50
6"          56.25
8"          85.00
10"         130.00
   These factors will be applied using the 5/8 and 3/4 inch meter size as the
basis.  (400 cu.ft. times the base block water rate).
   These service charges are in addition to the consumption charges based on
the block rate schedule.
   (d)   Minimum Charge Per Billing Period or Part Thereof.  The minimum charge
per single unit for any billing period or part thereof shall in no event be
less than the water service availability charge (WSAC) per billing cycle.
   When the City's water supply has been available for ninety days to improved
lots, whether connected or not, the minimum charge shall apply and be due and
payable each and every billing cycle.
   (e)   Multi-units.  The minimum charge for multi-units shall be based on the
water service availability charge for a 5/8" - 3/4" meter, times the number of
units.
   (f)   Multi-unit Change.  A unit change may be granted upon a written
request to the  Director, stating the changes that have been made to the multi-
units served by the Utility.  After an inspection by a representative of the

shall be assessed as a tax lien against the property involved, collectible
according to law.
   (i)   Waiver of Minimum Charges.  An owner may request a waiver of the
minimum charges upon written  request to the Director.  The request may be
granted on unimproved lots and lots with vacant buildings where no consumption
or availability for consumption exists.
      (1)   Any consumption within a billing period will establish the need to
charge the account the minimum of the W.S.A.C. which is currently in effect.
      (2)   Where there has been no consumption, the meter removed and the
owner or person in control of the property has requested a waiver, the W.S.A.C.
will be waived.  In effect access to the City water and wastewater service is
discontinued and no charge will be levied against the account.
      (3)   In the event that access to the City utilities are requested and
the existing tap is to be utilized, a one time fee of seventy-five dollars
($75.00) will be charged for reservicing the account.

contamination of the utility's water supply, no cross connections whatsoever
will be permitted between another or foreign water supply and/or piping system
and utility's water supply and/or piping system.  Further, no connection of any
kind whatsoever will be permitted that would make it possible for any other
water supply sources, including drainage, wastewater or other contamination, to
enter utility's water system.  The utility also reserves the right to refuse to
furnish service or to discontinue service after same has been once established
where possible water contamination can result from use of the water service by
the consumer.
      (2)   For fire protection service see subsections (j) and (i) hereof.

entitle the consumer to the net rates nor the remission of any charge for
nonpayment within the time specified.
      (2)   In the event of the stoppage of or the failure of any water meter
to register the full amount of water consumed, the consumer will be billed for
such billing period on an estimated consumption basis which will be based upon
consumer's normal use of water in the similar period during the time the meter
was registering correctly.
      (3)   In the case of a question arising as to the accuracy of the meter,
the consumer shall request the utility to test the meter.  If the meter is

the regular billing period, the following billing procedure will apply:
         A.   When service is initially established to the consumer or where
the consumer's account is being transferred from one location to another and
the period of service involves seven days or less of the utility's regular
billing period, the consumer's initial usage at the new location will be
carried over into the succeeding regular billing period at that location and
shall be combined with and considered as part of same.
         B.   For all other service furnished for a partial billing period,
including all final bills, the bill shall be calculated in accordance with the
rate blocks and charges, including prorated minimum charges, as set forth in

include any bills incurred by a previous owner.)  All unpaid water bills shall
be assessed as a tax lien against the property involved, collectible according
to law.
      (1)   All gross bills and other charges due for water service, if not
paid within ninety days after the same are due and payable, shall become a lien
upon the premises being supplied and/or having the ability to be served by the
water utility.  Such a lien shall be certified to the Auditor of Knox County,
at which time the lien shall vest and the Auditor shall place same on the tax
duplicate of the County, together with the interest and penalties allowed by

extension, the terms and security of payments shall be as prescribed and shall
meet approval of the Utilities Commission.
   (m)   Utility's Liability.  The utility will use reasonable diligence in
supplying a regular and uninterrupted supply of water but shall not be liable
for damages in case such supply should be interrupted or fail by reason of an
act of God, the public enemy, accidents, strikes, legal processes, other
governmental interferences, breakdowns or injury to the machinery or water
distribution lines of the Utility or for extraordinary repairs.
   (n)   Consumer's Liability.
      (1)   The consumer as referred to throughout this chapter is defined as

(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.02   ADMINISTRATION.
   The City Engineer shall be the Administrator of the Stormwater Utility, as
established in this Chapter.  The Administrator, with approval from the Utility
Commission, shall be authorized to develop and adopt policies and standards, to
promote, regulate and administer the City's stormwater code. The regulations in
this chapter and other related provisions contained elsewhere in the Code shall
be administered by the City Engineer. 
   The Stormwater Utility will provide for effective management and financing
of the stormwater conveyance system within the City.
   (a)    In order to accomplish the purpose of effective financing of the
stormwater conveyance system within the City, the chapter shall:
      (1)   Establish and maintain fair and reasonable stormwater management
service charges for each lot or parcel in the City, which bear a substantial
relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and
facilities. Such service charges shall be charged because each property
contributes to stormwater runoff and benefits from effective management of
stormwater by the City of Mount Vernon.
      (2)   Ensure that similar properties pay similar stormwater management
service charges which reflect the area of each property and its intensity of
development, since these factors bear directly on the peak rate of stormwater
runoff.
               Charges for residential properties shall reflect the relatively
uniform effect that such development has on runoff. Charges for all other
properties shall be in proportion to residential properties, utilizing both
relative area and intensity of development in setting rates;
      (3)   Provide a mechanism for consideration of specific or unusual
service requirements of some properties, and special and general benefits
accruing to or from properties as a result of providing their own stormwater
management facilities;
      (4)   Provide for a service charge adjustment process to review
stormwater charges when unusual circumstances exist which alter runoff
characteristics, when either service or benefit varies from a normal condition
or is of greater significance than contribution to runoff or to periodically
ensure that rates reflect the current costs of effective stormwater management;
and
      (5)   Utilize stormwater management funds throughout the City, except
where activities or facilities are clearly unusual and in excess of the normal
level of service City-wide and where developers are responsible for providing
any new stormwater facilities required for their project.
         (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.03  PURPOSE.
   The City of Mount Vernon, hereinafter referred to as "the City", adopts this
Chapter to establish the Stormwater Utility and Utility Enterprise Fund for the
operation, maintenance and improvements to the City's stormwater conveyance
system.  The Chapter also establishes feasible and economically reasonable
standards to achieve a level of stormwater quality and quantity control, and
management and conservation practices that will abate erosion of the soil and
degradation of water resources by soil sediment caused by nonfarm, earth-
disturbing activities.  This Chapter will promote and maintain the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Mount Vernon.
   This Chapter further intends to:
   (a)   Permit development while keeping downstream flooding, erosion and
sedimentation at existing levels.
     (b)   Reduce water quality impacts and damage to receiving water
resources, streams, and drainage systems, and wetlands that may be caused by
increases in the quantity and/or rate of water discharged, and impairment of
their capacity that may be caused by sedimentation due to new development or
development activities.
   (c)   Establish a basis for the design of all storm drainage systems that
will preserve the rights and options of both the dominant and servient property
owners and help assure the long-term adequacy of storm drainage systems.
   (d)     Ensure that stormwater management practices are properly designed,
constructed, and maintained.
     (e)     Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
     (f)     Strive to preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge,
and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in
slippage prone soils.
     (g)     Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
     (h)     Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
     (i)     Maximize use of stormwater management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quantity control, water quality protection,
recreation, and habitat preservation.
     (j)     Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City's future expenses
related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
     (k)     Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.

contractor responsible for implementation (e.g., Contractor A will clear land
and install perimeter controls and Contractor B will maintain perimeter
controls until final stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors
engaged in activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall
contain a cover page with signatures from all of the identified subcontractors
indicating that they have been informed and understand their roles and
responsibilities in complying with the SWP3.
     (a)       All controls associated with SWP3s in the City of Mount Vernon
shall, at a minimum, include the required controls as outlined in the Ohio EPA
CGP.  The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-
sediment pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands. 
       (b)     It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of
contractor(s) responsible for implementation of the SWP3 and providing that
information to the City Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors
engaged in activities that could impact stormwater runoff.  The SWP3 shall
contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that
they have been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in
complying with the SWP3.  The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary
contractor prior to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3
training log to demonstrate that the review had occurred.
       (c)       Inspections (by Applicant).  All controls on the site shall be
inspected by qualified inspection personnel in accordance with the requirements
outlined in the Ohio EPA CGP.
     (d)     Maintenance.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization.  Per the Ohio EPA CGP, the applicant shall provide a description
of maintenance procedures within the SWP3, needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, as determined by the City
Engineer. When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the procedures outlined in
the Ohio EPA CGP shall be followed.
     (e)   Final Stabilization.  Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.
      (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.18  ABBREVIATED STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (Abbreviated SWP3)
REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the
applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the requirements
of this regulation.
   (b)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a professional engineer, a
registered surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)    The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs.
City Engineer may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction Entrances:  Construction entrances shall be built and
shall  serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than two inch (2")
in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance
with specifications in the most recent online edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
   
      (5)     Inlet Protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such
as boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)     Silt Fence or Other Perimeter Controls.  Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City of Mount Vernon shall be used to
protect adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via
sheet (diffused) flow.  Silt fence or other approved perimeter controls shall
be placed along level contours and the permissible drainage area is limited to
areas as specified in the OEPA CGP.
            (7)     Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within twenty-four (24) hours after any storm event greater than one-half (½)
inch of rain per 24-hour period.
      (8)    Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment-settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the new inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (9)   Final Stabilization: Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer.    (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.19   STORMWATER PEAK RATE OF RUNOFF CONTROL METHODS.
   To provide adequate stormwater management and to prevent off-site damage
from accelerated stormwater runoff from development areas, the increased peak
rates and volumes of runoff shall be controlled such that:
     (a)     The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions does not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a one-year frequency, 24-hour
storm occurring on the same development drainage area under pre-development
conditions.  Pre-development shall be defined for runoff control as site
conditions at the time of adoption of the City's original Stormwater Ordinance
1989-34, passed December 29, 1989.
   (b)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm up to the 100-year storm have peak runoff discharge rates no
greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size storms under pre-
development conditions.  Consideration of the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100-year
storms will be considered adequate for designing and developing methods to meet
this standard.
     (c)     The critical storm for a specific development drainage area is
determined as follows:
      (1)     Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used for
full build out as proposed.
      (2)       Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
      (3)     Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect the
average type of land use over the past ten (10) years and not only the current
land use.
      (4)       To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description.
      (5)     Use the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) TR-55,
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, to determine the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a one-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development.
            (6)     From the volumes determined in (5), determine the percent
increase in volume of runoff due to development and using this percentage,
select the 24-hour critical storm from the following table:
Table 920.19.1: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:          The Critical Storm will be:
---                       10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       ---                     100 year
         (For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-
development runoff volume for a 1-year storm is thirty-five percent (35%), the
Critical Storm is a 5-year storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all
storms up to this frequency shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak
discharge rate from the 1-year frequency storm under pre-development conditions
in the development drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less
frequent storms need only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge
rates for each of those same storms.)
   (d)   Methods for controlling increases in the rate and volume of stormwater
runoff include many options. Some of those options are described in the Ohio
CGP. Acceptable design criteria for these options are included in the Rainwater
and Land Development Manual and the City's Stormwater Utility's Rules and
Regulations as promulgated by the Utility Commission.
      (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.20  PERMITS.

prescribed by the City Engineer, as directed below:
            (1)     For soil disturbing projects related to or involving
building construction.
            (2)     For all other soil disturbing activities, including but not
limited to site grading, grubbing and land clearing, but not involving building
construction.
            (3)     Unless otherwise exempt no zoning permit shall be issued,
and no soil-disturbing activities shall begin until a project stormwater
management, erosion and sedimentation control permit has been issued.
            (4)     Government agencies are not exempt from the permit
requirement for under this Chapter.
   (b)   Permit Processing.
            (1)     Stormwater management, erosion and sedimentation control
permit applications for projects involving building construction shall be
completed and filed with the permit fee at the City Engineering Department. 
The City Engineer shall review the permit application making comment on any
necessary corrections to the plan and advise the applicant of the results of
the review.  When all conditions are met, a stormwater management and sediment
control permit will be issued.
 
   (c)     Exceptions.
            (1)     Projects involving LESS than 20,000 square feet of land
disturbance are exempt from a permit as noted above; however, these projects
shall complete an Agreement with the City using the City's forms.
         (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)

the site design, and the rationale for their selection. The rationale must
address how these stormwater management practices will address flooding within
the site as well as flooding that may be caused by the development upstream and
downstream of the site. The rationale will also describe how the stormwater
management practices minimize impacts to the physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics of on-site and downstream water resources and, if necessary,
correct current degradation of water resources that is occurring or take
measures to prevent predictable degradation of water resources.

the approval of the City Engineer.
 
   (c)     Stormwater Agreement.   The developer/owner of each major
subdivision constructed in City of Mount Vernon shall submit to the City,
through the City Engineer, an agreement to construct all necessary stormwater
management facilities, and to provide for their future maintenance, by
assessment to all lots that lie within the subdivision.  This agreement shall
be on a form approved by the City Law Director, and signed by all persons
having a vested interest in the
subdivision.
   (d)    Maintenance Fund.  Upon completion of the work, or when suitable
surety is established in accordance with the City of Mount Vernon Subdivision
Regulations, the City Engineer will request a hearing before the Municipal
Planning Commission, to establish procedures and assessments for the
maintenance of the stormwater management facilities within the development.
     Maintenance assessments will begin the year after acceptance of the
subdivision, based upon an assessment schedule prepared by the City Engineer,
and approved by the Municipal Planning Commission.  All maintenance assessments
will be paid into a stormwater conveyance system maintenance fund that is
established for the sole benefit of the subdivision in question.
     Annual inspections, as well as all necessary maintenance work, shall be
performed by/or under the supervision of the City Engineer.  All expenditures
from the maintenance fund shall be approved by the City Engineer.
 
   (e)     Maintenance Fund Characteristics and Calculations.  The maintenance
funds are derived from an annual assessment levied against all owners of lots
within the subdivision, and are accumulated until they are needed to perform
maintenance, repair or replacement as the facilities age.
     The amount of the maintenance fund is based on the original construction
cost of the stormwater facilities in the subdivision.  The maintenance fund may
never have an unencumbered balance of more than twenty percent (20%) of the
cost of original improvement, as adjusted to current costs.  Once the fund has
reached the twenty percent (20%) maximum, assessments will abate until such
time as monies are withdrawn from the fund to maintain, repair, or replace some
element of the stormwater management system.  The annual assessment is
determined by dividing the maximum maintenance fund balance by six (6) years. 
The entire maintenance fund amount is apportioned to the lots within the
subdivision on a fair and equitable formula in order to establish the
appropriate amount to be assessed to each property.
       Upon special request, the rate of assessment may be partially abated
over the initial five (5) year period following subdivision approval.  This
abatement is to allow developers time to sell individual lots without creating
an undue strain on cash flow during the early phases of development.  Beginning
with the fifth year of the schedule, the assessment is collected at the full
rate.  Generally, using this assessment schedule where payments in the first
five years are partially abated, it requires between nine (9) and ten (10)
years to reach its maximum balance, provided no monies have been withdrawn, as
indicated in Table 920.24.1.  Requests for abatement must be presented to the
Water and Wastewater Commission for consideration and dispensation.

920.25   STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General:  The stormwater conveyance system, including stormwater
management practices for storage, treatment and control, and conveyance
facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure flooding during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment runoff patterns, flows,
and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
            (1)     Integrated practices that address degradation of water
resources. The stormwater management practices shall function as an integrated
system that controls flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical,
biological, and chemical integrity of the water resources receiving stormwater
discharges from the site. Acceptable practices shall:
                 A.     Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is
intended to support a watercourse restoration project and is approved by the
City Engineer.
                 B.       Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater
recharge on as much of the site as practicable.
                 C.       Only install new impervious surfaces and compact
soils where necessary to support the future land use.
                 D.     Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new
impervious surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to
equal or less than predevelopment levels. Stormwater management practices that
meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria required by the
City Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
            (2)       Practices designed for final use: Stormwater management
practices shall be designed to achieve the stormwater management objectives of
this regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of
the site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function
safely with minimal maintenance.
            (3)       Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in the City's subdivision regulations, shall provide
stormwater management and water quality controls for the development of all
subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage
that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and
maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns,
volumes, and peaks from the lot.
            (4)       Stormwater facilities in water resources:  Stormwater
management practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water
resources unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate
permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal,
state, and local agencies and the activity is in compliance with all other City
requirements  as determined by the City Engineer.
            (5)     Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All
stormwater pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one
(1) foot freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during
the 100-year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance
channels, the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and
alternative designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a
safe design.
            (6)       Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are
conducted shall be exempt from these requirements if it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the  City Engineer that the site is part of a larger common
plan of development where the stormwater management requirements for the site
are provided by an existing stormwater management practice, or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City
Engineer.
            (7)     Maintenance: All stormwater management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements
approved by the City Engineer pursuant to Section
 920.21(c).
            (8)     Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City,
stormwater management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be
on a separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if
compensated by the property owners, by the City of Mount Vernon. Stormwater
management practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots,
protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
            (9)     Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. Practices that
preserve and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the
maximum extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading
and compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas,
and existing vegetation, and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas. 
Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide perpetual management of
runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving stream's physical, chemical and
biological characteristics are protected and ecological functions are
maintained.
 
   (b)     Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria:  All stormwater management
practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum
practical removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall
include but not be limited to:
            (1)     Surface Water Protection: The City Engineer may allow the
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from
the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
local agencies, and the activity is in compliance with all other City
requirements, including this Chapter as determined by the City Engineer.  At a
minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property
            (2)       Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater
runoff that discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be
conveyed through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development
site at its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows
shall be diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is
not possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat
the offsite flow. Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved until it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site runoff will
be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner that does not
exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
            (3)     Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that
maintains sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of
sheet flow shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site
grading, and the use of easements or other legally binding mechanisms that
prohibit re-grading and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas.
In no case shall the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a
sheet flow area exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel,
storm sewer, or other stormwater management practice from areas too long and/or
too large to maintain sheet flow, as determined by the City Engineer.
            (4)       Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the City
Engineer, drainage tributary to stormwater management practices shall be
provided by an open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the 10-
year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from upstream contributory areas.
            (5)     Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems are preferred
on all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems are allowed when the site cannot be developed at densities allowed
under City of Mount Vernon zoning or where the use of an open drainage system
affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City Engineer.
            (6)     Storm sewer systems, culverts, bridges, and velocity
dissipation measures within the City of Mount Vernon are to be designed and
constructed per the requirements of the current version of the Ohio Departments
of Transportation's "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two - Drainage Design."
            (7)       Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be
used to convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an
adequate receiving water resource or stormwater management practice such that
the runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path
and does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-
year water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one
foot below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the
flood routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall
be taken into consideration.
            (8)       Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to
preserve floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water
surface elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City
Engineer must be compensated by providing an equivalent volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City, reductions in volume due to
floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the
development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
   (c)       Stormwater Quality Control:
            (1)     Direct runoff to a BMP: The site shall be designed to
direct runoff to one or more of the stormwater management practices listed in
Table 2 of the Ohio EPA CGP, designed to meet the requirements of the Ohio EPA
CGP, and the guidance provided in the most recent online edition of the Ohio
EPA Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
                 A.       For sites less than five (5) acres, but greater than
one (1) acre and not part of a common plan of development, where five (5) or
less acres are disturbed, the City Engineer may approve other BMPs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these BMPs meet
the objectives of this regulation.
                 B.       For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, the City Engineer may approve other BMPs
if the applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these
BMPs meet the objectives of this regulation, and has prior written approval
from the Ohio EPA.
                 C.       For the construction of new roads and roadway
improvement projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships,
cities, or villages), the City Engineer may approve BMPs not included in Table
2  of the Ohio EPA CGP, but must show compliance with the current version of
the Ohio Departments of Transportation's "Location and Design Manual, Volume
Two Drainage Design."
            (2)       Criteria applying to all stormwater management practices.
Practices chosen must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv) per the
requirements of the Ohio EPA CGP, and the guidance provided in the most recent
online edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual, in compliance
with Ohio water quality standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
            (3)       Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-
construction BMP's: The applicant may request approval from the City Engineer
for the use of alternative structural post construction BMP's if the applicant
shows to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that these BMP's are equivalent
in pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in the Ohio CGP, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is mandatory.
         (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.26   EASEMENTS.
   Access to stormwater management practices as required by the City Engineer
for inspections and maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following
conditions shall apply to all easements:
     (a)       Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Stormwater Management Plan.
     (b)       Easements shall be approved by the City prior to approval of a
final plat and shall be recorded with the Knox County recorder and on all
property deeds.
     (c)       Unless otherwise required by the City Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all stormwater management practices shall be
no less than 25-feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire
practice plus an additional 25-foot wide band around the perimeter of the
stormwater management practice.
   (d)       The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to
allow maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each
facility, as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
     (e)     Easements to structural stormwater management practices shall be
restricted against the construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and
other structures that may obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage
of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final
grade from that described by the final grading plan approved by the City. Any
re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be
removed by the City at the property owners' expense.
      (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.27  CITY ENGINEER PLAN REVIEW.
     The stormwater management and sediment control plan shall be submitted to
the City Engineer for review and approval.  No earth-disturbing activities
shall commence until said approval has been received.  This approval is
separate and distinct from the preliminary plat and final plat reviews and
approvals conducted by the Municipal Planning Commission.  The Municipal
Planning Commission will not give final plat approval unless the City Engineer
has reviewed and approved the stormwater management and sediment control plan.
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.28    INSPECTION AND COMPLIANCE DURING CONSTRUCTION.
     If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, immediate and irreparable damage
will occur to adjacent or downstream property he may order the appropriate
action to cease work and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure compliance
with this Chapter.
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.29   FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
     To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
City Engineer:
     (a)     Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent stormwater
management practices must be installed and made functional, as determined by
the City Engineer and per the approved stormwater management plan.
     (b)     An As-Built Certification, including a Survey and Inspection, must
be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the stormwater management practices,
as designed and installed, meet the requirements of the stormwater management
plan approved by the City Engineer.  In evaluating this certification, the City
Engineer may require the submission of a new set of stormwater practice
calculations if he/she determines that the design was altered significantly
from the approved comprehensive stormwater management plan. The As-Built Survey
must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing of such practices and
include the entity responsible for long-term maintenance as detailed in the
Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.  These documents shall be submitted in
electronic format acceptable to the City on State Plane Coordinates.
     (c)     A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement as specified in Section
920.21(c) shall be provided to the City Engineer.
      (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.30  ON-GOING INSPECTIONS OF PERMANENT STRUCTURES.
     The City shall inspect stormwater management practices regularly as
described in the Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement. The City has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct
inspections as necessary, with prior notification of the property owner, to
verify that the practices are being maintained and operated in accordance with
this regulation. Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance, the
City shall provide written notification to the responsible party, as detailed
in the operations and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance.
     Upon notification, the responsible party shall have five (5) working days,
or other mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or submit a plan with
detailed action items and established timelines. Should repairs not be made
within this time, or a plan approved by the City Engineer for these repairs not
be in place, the City may undertake the necessary repairs and assess the
responsible party.  (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.31  VARIANCE.
   The Utility Commission may grant a variance under this Chapter for land
disturbances in excess of 20,000 sq. ft., whenever an owner, or his appointed
representative, can show evidence that a hardship exists, whereby, compliance
is not appropriate, based upon the following:
     (a)     That exceptional and/or unusual topographic or other physical
conditions exist that are peculiar to the particular parcel of land.
     (b)     That the peculiar conditions, noted in Paragraph (a) above, did
not result from any previous action by the owner.
     (c)     That such a literal interpretation of this Chapter would deprive
the owner of rights that are enjoyed by other property owners.
   PLEASE NOTE: Adverse economic conditions shall not be considered a valid
reason, or hardship, for a variance request to be granted.      No variances
will be granted, where activities occur that would defeat the purpose of this
Chapter. Requests for a variance should be submitted to City Engineer, stating
the specific variances being sought, an including sufficient data to justify
the granting of such variance.  (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)

and erosion and sedimentation control plan under this Chapter shall submit, as
a condition of its approval, a performance bond in an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the estimated construction costs of the improvements
to guarantee that they will be constructed in accordance with the plans and
this Chapter.  The bond shall be issued by an insurance company or surety
company licensed to do business in the State of Ohio.  The City Engineer shall
approve the amount of the bond and City Law Director shall approve the form of
the bond.
 
   (b)     In lieu of the performance bond required by subsection (a), the
applicant may submit an irrevocable letter of credit equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the estimated construction cost drawn on a commercial or
savings bank or saving association authorized to do business in the State of
Ohio, which agrees to honor the requests for payment by the City of Mount
Vernon as beneficiary upon submission of documentary evidence that the
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the plan and this
Chapter.  The City Engineer shall approve the amount of the letter of credit
and City Law Director shall approve the form of the letter of credit. 
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)

920.40  STORMWATER UTILITY FUND.
   All service charges and all sources of revenue generated by or on behalf of
the stormwater utility shall be deposited in a Stormwater Utility Enterprise
Fund and used exclusively for the stormwater utility.
   Funding for stormwater utility projects and programs may include but is not
limited to: stormwater service charges; stormwater permits and inspection fees;
other funds or income obtained from Federal, State, local and private grants or
loans.  In no year, shall the operating fund balance of the Stormwater Utility
show a loss.
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.41  STORMWATER UTILITY RATE STRUCTURE, CHARGES AND FEES.
   A stormwater service charge shall be assessed to each and every lot and
parcel of land within corporate limits of the City that is tributary directly
or indirectly to the stormwater conveyance system of the City and the owner
thereof that contains impervious area. The stormwater service charge is based
on the usage of the stormwater conveyance system by each property. This charge
is not related to the water and/or sewer service and does not rely on occupancy
of the premises to be in effect, and is therefore assessed for all properties
with impervious surface, in the amount determinable as follows: For any such
property, lot, parcel of land, building or premises that is tributary directly
or indirectly to the stormwater conveyance system of the City, such charge
shall be based upon the quantity of impervious area situated thereon.  All
properties having impervious area within the City will be assigned an
equivalent residential unit (ERU) or a multiple thereof, with all properties of
having impervious area receiving at least one ERU.
     (a)     Residential Properties. All residential properties will be
assigned one ERU per assigned physical address.  Any Condominium or HOA
commonly owned property with a separate physical address will be assigned a
single ERU.  A flat rate service charge will apply to all residential
properties, unless the property is undeveloped.  See Adjustment Mechanism,
Section
920.47(b).
       (b)     Nonresidential Properties. Nonresidential properties will be
assigned an ERU multiple based upon the properties' individually measured
impervious area (in square feet) divided by 2,900 square feet (1 ERU). This
division will be calculated to the first decimal place and rounded according to
mathematical convention.
     (c)     Base Rate. City Council shall, by resolution, establish the base
rate for the stormwater utility service charge. The base rate shall be
calculated to ensure adequate revenues to fund the expenditures of stormwater
management and to provide for the operation, maintenance, and capital
improvements of the stormwater conveyance system within the City limits.
       (d)    The rate established by City Council for each ERU within the City
of Mount Vernon is four dollars ($4.00) per month for Calendar Year 2020; five
dollars ($5.00) per month for Calendar Year 2021; and six dollars ($6.00) per
month for Calendar Year 2022 and thereafter, unless and until said rate is
changed by majority vote of City Council. Collection of the fee shall begin
July 1, 2020.  This rate is intended to eventually fully fund the City's
stormwater maintenance and operation program as well as partially fund the
City's Roads and Bridges Fund related to stormwater.
       (e)    An analysis of rates shall be performed during even years,
starting in 2022 to compare revenue projections with anticipated expenditures. 
Council shall review and approve the analysis in that year, prior to
authorizing an increase.
      (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.42  NECESSITY FOR CHARGES.
     It is hereby determined necessary for the protection of public health,
safety, and welfare and to conform with Federal, State, and local laws and
regulations that a system of charges for stormwater service be established
which allocates the cost of providing stormwater service to each user in such a
manner that the allocated costs are proportionate to the cost of providing
stormwater service to that user, insofar as those costs can reasonably be
determined.
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.43  RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   A nonresidential property owner may challenge the ERU multiple assigned to
his or her property by filing an appeal with the City Engineer for adjustment
thereof, stating in writing the grounds for the appeal. The City Engineer, or
the Engineer's designee, shall consider the appeal and determine whether an
adjustment of the ERU multiple for any such lot or parcel is necessary, and
adjust such ERU multiple if appropriate. Rate adjustments greater than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per month must be approved by the Utility Commission.
A two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) application fee is required for each
appeal only one appeal per parcel per year is allowed.  Decisions  of the City
Engineer may be appealed to the Utility Commission.  Decisions of the Utility
Commission may be appealed to the Knox County Court of Common Pleas. 
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.44    SERVICE CHARGE COLLECTION.
     Each stormwater service charge rendered under or pursuant to this chapter
is hereby made a lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or
premises that are tributary directly or indirectly to the stormwater conveyance
system of the City, and, if the same is not paid within Ninety (90) days after
it shall be due and payable, it shall be certified to the Auditor of the County
in which the property is located, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate
of said County with the interest and penalties allowed by law and be collected
as other utility service charges are collected.
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.45  ADJUSTMENTS TO STORMWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
     Increase adjustments (debit) can be made to non-residential service
charges by property owners adding additional impervious area, such as rooftops,
parking lots, driveways and walkways. Decrease (credit) adjustments, approved
by the City Engineer, can be made to non-residential service charges for
property owners performing activities that reduce the impact of stormwater
runoff to the stormwater conveyance system.  Such adjustments will be
calculated one time per year, by the City based on construction permits for new
additions, new developments or demolition. Property owners will be notified of
the service charge adjustment based on reduction or increase in impervious
surface area.    (Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.46  STORMWATER UTILITY BILLING AND COLLECTION.
     (a)     Stormwater charges shall be assessed monthly.  Payment shall be
made within fifteen days following the receipt of the statement of charges.

(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.47  CREDITING/ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM.
   (a)    Credits or adjustments can be made to non-residential service charges
for qualified property owners performing activities that reduce the impact of
stormwater runoff to the stormwater conveyance system for retention/detention
activities as follows:
      (1)   General Policies.
         A.    This program is available to all non-residential properties.
         B.    Credits will be issued on a property by property basis.
         C.    When a facility is jointly used by several non-residential
properties under a joint use agreement, including deed restriction, the credit
shall be prorated among the properties as a percentage of the tributary area.
      (2)   Credits Available.  Retention/Detention Credits may be granted for
approved facilities that reduce the quantity of stormwater and/or improve the
water quality of stormwater as follows:
         A.   The minimum amount of reduction (credit) available for meeting
minimum retention/detention design, construction, and maintenance standards is
twenty percent (20%).  The minimum twenty percent (20%)  credit will be given
to all eligible properties, which have constructed a retention/detention
facility in accordance with City policy, provided;
            (i)    such facility meets design, construction, and maintenance
standards in effect at the time of construction;
            (ii)    for which a complete credit application form has been
submitted;
            (iii)    there has been provided to the City a signed right-of-
entry by the owner thereof; and
            (iv)   there is paid to the City for such property a one-time, non-
refundable application/inspection fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
for the first retention/detention facility and
         B.    One hundred dollars ($100.00) for each additional retention/
detention facility on the same property.
         C.    The retention/detention credit is also available beyond the
twenty percent reduction under the following conditions:
         D.    The amount of reduction, if any, is based upon the following:
         E.     P = (0.8-0.3*(Qa/Qt))* 100
            (v)   where:
         F.     P is the percent reduction in stormwater fee to be applied to
the property.
         G.    Qa is the actual peak flow determined by calculating the peak
flow of a design storm from the retention/detention facility, using the "level
pool routing" technique.
         H.    Qt is the target peak flow from the design criteria, as defined
in Chapter
920.
         I.    SCS standard methodologies shall be used for all calculations
when determining actual peak flow.
         J.    The retention/detention credit beyond the twenty percent
reduction is available upon successful completion of the application process,
including the submittal of all necessary engineering calculations,
documentation including as-built drawings, proof of required information,
signed and stamped by a Professional Engineer registered in the State of Ohio.
         K.    The maximum amount of percent reduction (credit) available for
reducing discharge from the property to zero is fifty percent (50%).
         L.    Retention/detention credit is available only for those eligible
properties whose retention/detention facilities meet City design, construction
and maintenance standards.
         M.    For facilities constructed after the effective date of this
regulation, the credit will be made effective one year after project acceptance
by the City Engineer. 
         N.    Failure to operate or maintain the facility as designed shall be
reason for forfeiture of the credit. The City shall notify the property owner/
operator of the facility's deficiencies.
   (b)     Residential Adjustments.  Any owner of undeveloped residential
property may apply for a credit for the assessment for that particular
property.  Undeveloped residential property is a lot with a separate physical
address and no impervious area.  In no case, will the credit granted exceed the
assessment for that residential property.
(Ord.  2019-35.  Passed 11-12-19.)
920.99  PENALTY.
   (a)    Civil.  In instances where a property owner or tenant fails to remedy
any orders issued pursuant to this Chapter in the time period prescribed, the
City Engineer or his designee may assess the person or entity that received the
notice a penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to one
thousand dollars ($1000.00) per acre (or portion thereof) per day until the
violation is corrected. This penalty is in addition to any other actions that
may be taken by the City.   
   (b)    Criminal.  Any violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure
to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor.  Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate

including but not limited to legal costs and fees, because of any person or
entity's non-compliance with any provision of this Chapter, the expenses
incurred, plus an administrative fee equal to the expenses incurred shall be
recovered from the person or entity.
   (d)    Any amounts owed to the City of Mount Vernon pursuant to any
provision of this Chapter, whether for work completed by the City or for
assessed penalties or expenses, may be certified by the City Engineer or his
designee as a lien against the property with the Knox County Auditor for
collection in the same manner as property taxes and assessments.

1131.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community
development.  Once land has been divided into streets, blocks, lots and open
spaces, a pattern has been established which usually determines how well
community needs for residence, business and industry will be met.  It also
determines to a great extent how well the community will be able to handle its
traffic circulation problems, how well it will be able to meet the demand for
home sites and how efficiently and economically it will be able to provide the
many services demanded of it.
   (b)   After land has been subdivided and publicly recorded, it is very
difficult and costly to correct defects and deficiencies in the subdivision
layout and in the facilities provided.  In addition, a subdivided area sooner
or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be
maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be
provided.  The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many
important respects.  The guidance of land development in harmony with community
objectives is therefore a matter of serious public concern, and it is in the
interest of the public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions
be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper
minimum standards.
   (c)   These Subdivision Regulations and the Major Thoroughfare Plan,
certified copies of which are filed in the Office of the County Clerk, are
designed for the harmonious development of the subdivided area, for a
coordinated layout, for the proper arrangement of streets for adequate and
convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, recreation, light, air and
access of fire-fighting equipment, for avoidance of population congestion
through requirements for minimum lot widths and lot areas, for adequate
provision of water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary facilities and for
reducing flood damage potentials to the greatest extent possible.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1131.02  AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (a)   These Subdivision Regulations were adopted under the authority granted
by Ohio R.C. 711.09.  The Planning Commission, which was established in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 713.01, has fulfilled the requirements set forth in
applicable sections of the Ohio Revised Code as a prerequisite for the adoption
of such Regulations.
   (b)   These Regulations provide a procedure and minimum standards of design
and construction by which the Planning Commission can equitably appraise all
proposed plats for land subdivision, plat preparation, review and approval
requirements.
   (c)   These Regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the
corporate limits of the City and within a three-mile limit of the corporate
limits as now or hereafter established.  Any owner of land within this area who
wishes to subdivide such land or a portion thereof shall submit a plat of the
proposed subdivision to the Planning Commission according to the requirements
set forth in these Regulations.

1133.01  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   No plat or plan of a subdivision of land located within the
jurisdiction of the Planning Commission shall be admitted to the records of
Knox County or received or recorded by the County Clerk until such plat has
received final approval in writing by the Commission.  Admission to the records
shall not be construed as approval.
   (b)   No board, public officer or authority shall accept, lay out, improve
or authorize utilities to be laid in any street within the territory for which
the Commission has adopted a Major Thoroughfare Plan unless the street has
received the legal status of a public street prior to the adoption of such
Plan, unless the street corresponds with a street shown on such Plan or unless
the street is shown on a subdivision plat or a street plat which has been
approved by the Commission.
   (c)   All subdivision plats which come before the Commission for approval
shall tie in with the sewage treatment system at the expense of the developer,
in accordance with Section

(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1133.02  VARIANCES.
   (a)   Exceptional Conditions.  The Planning Commission may grant a variance
to these Subdivision Regulations where, by reason of the unusual shape of a
specific piece of property or by reason of exceptional topographical
conditions, the strict application of these Regulations would result in extreme
practical difficulties and undue hardship upon the owner of such property,
provided, however, that such relief may be granted without detriment to the
public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of these
Regulations.  In granting such a variance or modification, the Commission may
require such conditions as will substantially secure the objectives of the
standards or requirements so varied or modified.  Financial disadvantage to the
property owner is not proof of hardship within the meaning of these
Regulations.
   (b)   Group Housing Developments.  A comprehensive group housing
development, including the large scale construction of housing units, together
with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by the Commission
although the design of the project does not include standard street, lot and
subdivision arrangements, provided that departure from the standards of these
Regulations can be made without destroying their intent.
   (c)   Procedural Variance.  Where a proposed subdivision would contain no
new streets and not more than ten lots, or not more than five lots if any new
street is planned, the procedure of preparing a preliminary plat may be waived
by the Commission following an application for a variance.
(Ord.  2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1133.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   A County Clerk who receives, files or records a plat in violation of
any of the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations shall be fined not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars
($500.00), as provided in Ohio R.C. 711.12.
   (b)   Whoever transfers or negotiates to transfer any lot in a subdivision
before the final plat of such subdivision has been approved by the Planning
Commission and recorded in the County Clerk's office, or attempts the
description of land by metes and bounds in violation of these Regulations,
shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000).

Commission for approval, the subdivider shall meet and consult informally with
the Commission for the purpose of ascertaining the locations of proposed major
streets, parks, playgrounds, school sites and other planned projects which may
affect the property being considered for subdivision.  At the same meeting, the
subdivider shall review with the Commission the minimum standards of
subdivision design set forth in Chapter
1139.  This informal review shall prevent unnecessary and costly revisions in
the layout and development of the subdivision.  Formal application or filing of
a plat with the Commission is required for this informal advisory meeting. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)

1137.01  IMPROVEMENTS PREREQUISITE TO FINAL APPROVAL.
   A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a
prospective lot purchaser until he or she can see actual physical
transformation of raw acreage into lots suitable for building purposes and
human habitation.  Improvements by the subdivider spare the community a
potential tax liability.  The tangible improvements contained in this chapter
are required before final plat approval in order to assure the physical reality
of a subdivision, which approval and recording will establish legality.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1137.02  MONUMENTS.
   (a)   Concrete monuments at least thirty-six inches in length and four
inches in diameter or four inches square shall be set at all corners on the
plat.  The top of the monument shall be flat and shall have an indented cross
to properly identify the location.  Except in cases where it is deemed clearly
unreasonable or infeasible by the Planning Commission, these monuments shall be
described on the final plat.
   (b)   An iron pin of one-half inch minimum diameter or iron pipe monuments
not less than three-fourths of an inch in diameter and not less than thirty
inches in length shall be set at all lot corners not marked by concrete
monuments at all street corners, at all points where street lines intersect and
the exterior boundaries of the subdivision and at all intersections of curves
and tangents along street lines.
   (c)   At the discretion of the Commission and within the definition of the
Ohio Revised Code, additional markers may be required.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1137.03  GRADING OF STREETS.
   (a)   Grading Required; Deviations.  All streets, roads and alleys shall be
graded to their full widths by the subdivider so that pavements and sidewalks
can be constructed on the same level plane.  Deviation from this standard due
to special topographical conditions will be allowed only with the special
approval of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Preparation of Subgrade.  Before grading is started, the entire right-
of-way area shall be first cleared of all tree stumps, roots, brush and other
objectionable materials and of all trees not intended for preservation.  The
subgrade shall be properly shaped, rolled and uniformly compacted to conform
with the accepted cross-section and grades.
   (c)   Cuts.  In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic materials, soft
clay, spongy material and other objectionable materials shall be removed to a
depth of at least two feet below the graded surface.  Rock, when encountered,
shall be scarified to a depth of at least twelve inches below the graded
surface.
   (d)   Fills.  In fills, all tree stumps, boulders, organic materials, soft
clay, spongy materials and other objectionable materials shall be removed to a
depth of at least two feet below the natural ground surface.  This
objectionable matter as well as similar matter from cuts shall be removed from
the right-of-way area and disposed of in such a manner that it will not become
incorporated in fills or hinder proper operation of the drainage system.
   (e)   Under Drainage.  Adequate under drainage shall be provided wherever
good engineering practice dictates.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1137.04  UTILITIES.
   (a)   General Installation Requirements.  Utilities shall be installed in
rear lot easements except where utility lines already exist.  This excludes
water, gas and sewer utilities.  A total of twelve feet shall be provided at
the rear property lines for any utilities required.
   (b)   Water Supply System.  Where, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, the public water supply is reasonably accessible or available to
the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall construct a complete water
distribution system which shall adequately serve all lots and which shall
include appropriately spaced fire hydrants, and this system shall be properly
connected with the public water supply.  Where a public water supply is not
within a reasonable distance or otherwise available, the subdivider shall
normally be required to construct a similar water distribution system and
connect it with an alternate supply approved by the County Health
Commissioner.  Before the Planning Commission approves the use of individual
wells, lot sizes shall meet all regulations of the Regional Planning and Health
Commission and the same shall be submitted for the approval of the County
Health Commissioner.
   (c)   Sanitary Sewers.  Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
the public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible or available to
the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall construct a subdivision sewerage
system to adequately serve all lots and connect the subdivision system to the
public system after the City Engineer or designee has approved the size of the
lines.  Where lots cannot be served by the extension of an existing public
sanitary sewer, the subdivider shall meet the regulations of the General Health
District as to lot sizes for individual septic tanks and disposal fields. 
Plans  shall be submitted for approval bythe County Health Commissioner or a
permit for the use of a neighborhood disposal system shall be obtained from the
County Health Commissioner.
   (d)   Storm Drainage.  An adequate drainage system, including underground
pipes, manholes, inlets, catch basins and other appurtenances, shall be
provided for the proper drainage of all surface water and for the maintenance
of any natural drainage courses.  All storm sewers shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with City standards.
   (e)   Electric and Telephone Service.  In all cases, electric and telephone
service shall be installed at the rear property line.  Whenever possible,
underground cables shall be installed.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1137.05  STREET NAME SIGNS.
   The Planning Commission shall require the developer to install durable
street name signs bearing City Council approved street names at all
intersections as well as all other appropriate signs for adequate traffic
control.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
   
1137.06  COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS PRIOR TO APPROVAL OF THE FINAL PLAT.
   No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission or
accepted for record by the County Clerk until the improvements required by this
chapter are constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the
appropriate City official having jurisdiction.  In lieu of such prior
construction, the Commission may accept a security bond or certified check
payable to the City in an amount equal to the estimated cost of installation of
the required improvements whereby the improvements may be made and utilities
installed without cost to the City in the event of default on the part of the
subdivider.  The bond or check shall be subject to the condition that the
improvements will be completed within two years after approval of the final
subdivision plat.

1139.01  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   The Planning Commission shall impose the general requirements contained in
this chapter and compel all subdividers to comply with the principles of design
contained in this chapter in the layout of subdivisions. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.02  SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided
is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage, steep
slopes, rock formations and other such conditions as erosion or flood hazards,
and if, from adequate investigations conducted by all the public agencies
concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public the
land should not be platted and developed for the purpose proposed, the
Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods
are formulated by the subdivider for meeting the problems that will be created
by the subdivision and development of the land.
   (b)   The Commission may refuse to approve what it considers to be scattered
or premature subdivision of land which would involve danger or injury to the
public health, safety, welfare or prosperity by reason of lack of adequate
water supply, schools, proper drainage, good roads and transportation
facilities or other public services, or which would necessitate an excessive
expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services, such as undue
maintenance costs for adequate roads.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.03  STREETS.
   (a)   Conformity to Major Thoroughfare Plan.  The widths and locations of
all streets in a proposed subdivision must conform to the Major Thoroughfare
Plan.
   (b)   Extensions.
      (1)   The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide for the
continuation or projection of streets already existing in areas adjacent to the
area being subdivided unless the Planning Commission deems such continuation or
extension undesirable for specific reasons of topography or design.
      (2)   Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable
to provide street access to adjoining properties, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundaries of such properties.  Where the
Commission deems it necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with
turn-around having a radius of at least forty feet.
      (3)   The street system for the proposed subdivision shall provide for
extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case shall a
street extension be of less width than the minimum width required in these
Subdivision Regulations for a street in its category.
   (c)   Dedication of Right of Way for New Streets.  The dedication of the
right of way for new streets measured from lot line to lot line shall be as
shown on the Major Thoroughfare Plan, or, if not shown thereon, shall meet the
following standards:
 
                                   Minimum

      (1)   All points of access streets shall be as approved by the Planning
Commission.  Marginal access streets may be required by the Commission for
subdivisions fronting on arterial streets.
      (2)   Through proposed business areas, street widths shall be increased
ten feet on each side if needed to provide parking without interfering with
normal traffic movements.
      (3)   In cases where topography or other physical conditions make a
street of the required minimum width impractical, the Planning Commission may
modify these requirements.
   (e)   Pavement Specifications.
      (1)   Sub-base construction.  All developers shall be required to
construct a roadway sub base that complies with the specifications of the Ohio
Department of Transportation (Item 203 and 204) for the type of roadway being
constructed.
      (2)   Base Construction.  All developers shall be required to construct
the following type of base:
         A.   Concrete Pavement:  The base for a concrete street shall consist
of a four (4) inches of compacted granular material meeting the Ohio Department
of Transportation Specifications for Item 304.
         B.   Pavement Surface Construction:  All developers shall construct a
hard surfaced street of seven (7) inches minimum thickness Portland Cement
Concrete Pavement meeting the specifications of Ohio Department of

predominantly single-family residential developments where all lots have a
width of seventy-five feet or more.
      (4)   Handicap Ramps shall be provided at all corners.
   (h)   Dedication of Right of Way for Existing Streets.  Subdivisions platted
along existing streets shall dedicate additional right of way if necessary to
meet the minimum street width requirements set forth in subsection (c) hereof.
      (1)   The entire minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated where the
subdivision is on both sides of an existing street.  When the subdivision is
located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-
of-way width, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be
dedicated.
      (2)   Dedication of one-half of the rights of way for proposed streets
along the boundaries of land proposed for subdivision shall be prohibited.
   (i)   Intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles.

      (2)   Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least
twenty feet.  When the smallest angle of street intersection is less than sixty
degrees, the Planning Commission shall require curb radii of greater length. 
Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable
radius without reducing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal
width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise
set back sufficiently to permit such curb construction.
      (3)   No lot or other parcel of land which abuts on and has access to
either a collector or a minor street shall have a service drive, curb cut or
other means of access to an arterial street within seventy-five feet of the
right of way of any street which intersects such arterial street on the side on
which such lot or parcel is located.
   (j)   Curves in Streets; Horizontal and Vertical.
      (1)   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.

Collector   7                 5
Minor       8                 7
      (2)   All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of
surface water from the pavement and from the right of way by grading and
drainage.  For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall be not less
than one-half of one percent.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall not approve streets which will be
subject to inundation or flooding.  All streets must be located at elevations
which will make them flood-free in order that portions of the subdivision will
not be isolated by floods.  Where flood conditions exist, the Commission shall
require profiles and elevations of streets in order to determine the
advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity.
      (4)   Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding in order to provide
flood- free streets if such fill does not unduly increase flood heights. 
Drainage openings shall be designed so as not to restrict the flow of water and
thereby unduly increase flood heights.
   (l)   Marginal Access Streets.  Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon or
contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on which traffic
volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety considerations, the
Commission may require that marginal access streets be provided in order that
no lots will front on such existing or proposed arterial street or highway.
   (m)   Street Jogs.  Street Jogs are prohibited.

   (n)   Cul-de-sac.  Minor terminal cul-de-sac streets or courts which are
designed so as to have one end permanently closed shall not be longer than
1,000feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a
radius at the outside of the pavement of at least forty feet and a radius at
the outside of the right of way of at least fifty-five feet.
   (o)   Street Names.
      (1)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other
already existing and named streets shall bear the names of such existing
streets.
      (2)   The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an
existing street shall not duplicate the name of any existing street,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place,
court, lane, road, pike, highway, parkway or similar suffix.
 
   (p)   Private Streets and Reserve Strips.
      (1)   There shall be no private streets platted within a subdivision.
      (2)   There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except where
their control is definitely vested in the City or County under conditions
approved by the Planning Commission as authorized in these Subdivision
Regulations.
   (q)   Alleys.  Alleys shall be provided to give access to the rear of all
lots used for business and industrial purposes.  Alleys shall not be provided
in residential blocks except in cases where the subdivider produces evidence of
the need for alleys which is satisfactory to the Planning Commission.  (Ord.
2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.04  BLOCKS.
   (a)   Length.  Block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet or be less than 400
feet, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure efficient
use of land or desired features of street layout.
   (b)   Width.  Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth.  However, where this would require lots to front on an arterial
street or highway or where topographical conditions or the size of the property
prevent two tiers of lots, the Commission may approve a single tier of lots of
minimum depth.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.05  LOTS.
   (a)   Relationship to Streets.  All lots shall front on a public street or
road for a minimum distance of seventy-five feet, except that lots which front
on the turn-arounds of permanent dead-end streets shall front on such turn-
arounds for a minimum distance of forty feet.
   (b)   Arrangement.  Each lot in a subdivision shall contain a building site
completely free from the danger of flooding.  Except where infeasible, side lot
lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved
street lines.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3181.jpg]
   (c)   Dimensions.  The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as
the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated.
      (1)   Lot dimensions within the corporate limits shall conform to the
requirements of the Zoning Code, except that residential lots not served by
public sewers shall be a minimum of one (1) acrein area or the minimum lot
width and area determined by the County Health Commissioner, whichever width
and area is larger.
      (2)   The minimum width and minimum area of residential lots to be served
by individual private wells shall be determined by the County Health
Commissioner after investigation of soil conditions, the proposed sewerage
system and the depth of ground water.
   (d)   Building Set-back Line.  The building set-back line shall not be
located closer than thirty feet from the street right-of-way line.
   (e)   Corner Lots.  Corner lots shall have sufficient extra width to meet
the building set-back lines established on both the front street and side
street.
   (f)   Yard Requirements.  Yard requirements for residential subdivisions or
the portions thereof inside the corporate limits shall be the same as the yard
requirements set forth in the Zoning Code for the zoning district or districts
in which they are located.
   (g)   Flood Hazards.
      (1)   Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically
unsuitable for residential development shall not be platted for residential use
or for any other use which may increase the danger to health, life or property
or aggravate erosion or flood hazards.  Such land within the subdivision shall
be set aside on the plat for such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or
occasional inundation or will not result in conditions contrary to the public
welfare.  To ensure that lots will be located only where they will provide
flood-free house sites, the Planning Commission may require the subdivider to
provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate that the house
sites will be completely free from the danger of flooding.
      (2)   If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed subdivision,
the plat plan shall provide for an easement or right of way along the stream
for a floodway.  For the smaller streams, the plan shall also provide for
channel improvements to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within
banks.  The floor elevations of houses shall be high enough to be well above
the extraordinary flood.  The floodway easement shall be wide enough to provide
for future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become more
highly developed and run-off rates are increased.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-
12-05.)
         
1139.06  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   In commercial and industrial subdivisions and in the portions of residential
subdivisions reserved for commercial or industrial uses, the lots or parcels
platted for commercial or industrial sites shall be large enough to provide for
off-street loading and unloading facilities and off-street parking facilities. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.07  UTILITY AND DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Except where alleys are permitted for such purpose, the Planning
Commission shall require easements at least twelve feet in width centered along
all rear lots lines for poles, wires, conduits, storm sewers, sanitary sewers,
gas mains, water mains, heat mains and other utility facilities.  Where
necessary or advisable, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, similar
easements shall be provided along side lot lines or across lots.
   (b)   If the Commission deems it necessary for proper drainage within or
through a subdivision, it shall require that a storm water easement or drainage
right of way be provided.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.08  COMMUNITY ASSETS.
   In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for natural features such as
large trees unusual rock formations and watercourses, for sites which have
historical significance and for similar assets which, if preserved, will add
attractiveness and value to the subdivision and to the community (i.e. colonial
architecture).  The Planning Commission may prepare a list of all such features
within its area of subdivision jurisdiction which it deems worthy of
preservation.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.09  CONFORMITY WITH ZONING AND OTHER REGULATIONS.
   No final plat of land within the area of force and effect of the Zoning Code
will be approved unless it conforms with such Zoning Code.  Whenever there is a
discrepancy between the minimum standards set forth in these Subdivision
Regulations and those contained in the Zoning Code, the Building Code or other
official regulations, the stricter standard shall control.  However, in the
case of lot sizes, the Zoning Code shall control.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.10  PUBLIC OPEN SPACES.
   Where a school, neighborhood park, recreation area or public access to water
frontage, which is shown on an official map or in a plan for future land use
made and adopted by the Planning Commission, is located in whole or in part in
the applicant's proposed subdivision, the Commission may require the dedication
or reservation of such open space within the proposed subdivision for school,
park, recreation or other public purposes.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.11  LARGE TRACTS OR PARCELS.
   When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots,
such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets
and logical resubdivision.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.12  CONDOMINIUM AND COMMUNITY UNIT PLANS.
   The owners or agents of any tract of land, which is to be developed and
maintained under single ownership or which is to be subdivided as a
condominium, shall submit to the Planning Commission a development plan,
improvement plans and plats.  Approval of plats, etc., shall follow the
standard procedures provided in these Subdivision Regulations, provided,
however, that the following conditions are met:
   (a)   The property adjacent to the area included in the plan will not be
adversely affected.
   (b)   The plan is consistent with the intent and purposes of the Zoning Code
to promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
   (c)   The grade width and degree of improvement of all access drives,
sewers, water lines and other utilities are approved by the Planning
Commission, the City Engineering Department, and the Fire Chief.
   (d)   The building or buildings shall be used only for the uses permitted in
the zoning district in which they are located.
   (e)   The average lot area per family, exclusive of the area occupied by
private streets or drives, shall not be less than that required by the
respective zoning districts.
   (f)   The setbacks from public streets and the required side and rear yard
sizes for multiple dwellings shall be provided.  Multiple buildings or a single
building may be constructed within the buildable area of the total tract.  The
minimum distance between multiple buildings shall be determined by the Planning
Commission.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
      
1139.13  STREAMS AND SURFACE DRAINAGE COURSES.
   Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located in the
area being subdivided and open drainage is permitted, the owner shall provide
an adequate easement for benefit of the proper political subdivision along each
side of the stream or open drainage course for the purpose of widening,
deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream or open drainage
course for drainage or water control.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.14  APPROVAL OF FLOOD HAZARD LAND.
   The right is reserved to disapprove any subdivision which is subject to
periodic flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage facilities. 
However, if the owner agrees to make such improvements as will make the area
completely safe for residential occupancy, the subdivision may be approved,
subject, however, to the approval of the City Board of Health.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1139.15  PLANNED UNIT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.
   The owners or agents of any tract of land, which is to be developed as a
single entity for a number of dwelling types and related commercial and
noncommercial uses and whose place does not correspond, in lot size, bulk or
type of dwelling, density, lot coverage or required open space, to these
Subdivision Regulations and the Zoning Code, shall comply with the provisions
of Chapter
1169.  Compliance with that chapter shall constitute compliance with the
Subdivision Regulations contained herein.

1141.01  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the New Subdivision Tree Planting Regulation
of the City of Mount Vernon, Ohio and shall apply to all zoning districts being
developed in the City.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1141.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the new subdivision tree planting regulation is to promote
and protect the public health, safety and welfare through the preservation and
protection of the environment by recognizing the vital importance of tree
growth in the ecological system.  It is further the purpose of this chapter to
specifically promote the preservation and replacement of major trees removed in
the course of land development, and to regulate tree planting in the tree lawns
along public streets in new subdivisions.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1141.03  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   “Tree planting” means the use of trees in landscaping.
   (b)   “Major tree” means a living tree with a trunk diameter of at least six
inches, measured at a point twenty-four inches above ground level.
   (c)   “Shade Tree Commission” means the established three member commission
regulated under Chapter
141.01 of the City’s Codified Ordinances.
   (d)   “Safety-Service Director” means the position established under Chapter
129 of the City’s Codified Ordinances or his assistant or duly authorized
designee for the purposes of carrying out the intent of these regulations.
   (e)   “Tree lawn” means the City right-of-way between the back side of the
curb or edge of pavement and the street side of the sidewalk or front property
line.
   (f)   “Planning Commission” means the same as that described in Chapter
1131.03 (k) of the City’s Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1141.04  TREE PRESERVATION.
   All major trees shall be preserved unless exempted, as follows:  The Safety-
Service Director may approve the cutting down, removal or destruction of a
major tree when the tree interferes with the proper development of the plat
provided that the plat is the subject of application for approval of a zoning
certificate, a site plan variance, or a conditional use permit, and provided
such application is approved and one of the following applies:
   (a)   The tree will be located within a public right-of-way or easement.
   (b)   The tree is located within the area to be covered by proposed
structures or within twenty feet from the perimeter of structures, and the
proposed  structures cannot be located in a manner to avoid removal of the
tree.
   (c)   The tree will be located within a proposed driveway designed to
service a single family home.
   (d)   The tree is damaged or diseased.
   (e)   The tree is an undesirable species in its present location.
   (f)   When preparing and reviewing subdivision plans and tree planting
plans, good faith effort shall be made to preserve natural vegetation areas. 
Streets, lots, structures and parking areas shall be laid out to avoid the
unnecessary destruction of heavily wooded areas or outstanding tree specimens. 
Developers of land are encouraged to designate heavily wooded areas as park
reserves.
      (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
      
1141.05  TREE REPLACEMENT.
   (a)   Each major tree removed pursuant to Section
1141.04 during the course of development of the plat shall be replaced by the
owner of the plat with trees having a trunk diameter of at least two inches,
measured at a point twenty-four inches above ground level.
   (b)   Enforcement procedure for this critical code segment shall be by
submission of a total tree inventory of the plat by species, circumference, and
height, as approved by the Shade Tree Commission, along with a deposit in
compliance with the value determined by the Shade Tree Commission.  Following
project completion and tree replacement to the satisfaction of the City, a
refund may be made by the city to the owner of the plat.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1141.06  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any person seeking a new development site plan approval shall file
with his application a plan, which by plat plan and description shall include:
      (1)   The present location and size of all major trees, with a
designation of major trees sought to be removed.
      (2)   The location, size, and description of trees proposed to be placed
on the plat in order to comply with this chapter.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall either approve or disapprove all new
subdivision tree planting plans within thirty days of their filing.  For appeal
of a decision refer to Section
1135.07(d).
   (c)   No variance, zoning certificate, conditional use permit, or final
subdivision plat approval by the Planning Commission shall be granted or issued
until the new subdivision tree planting plan has been approved.
   (d)   Bonding.  Depending upon conditions relating to the season of the
year, the size of the proposed development, the complexity of the tree planting
plan, and the developers time schedule, the City reserves the right to require
a performance bond equal to the approximate cost of tree planting to assure
that all required improvements shall be completed within two years of the
acceptance of the final subdivision plat by the City.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1141.07  TREE LAWN PLANTING REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Each new subdivision City block tree lawn is to be planted with a
single variety on both side of the street.  Succeeding blocks may be assigned a
different tree variety.  Extremely long blocks may have a variety change in
mid-block.
   
   (b)   The normal spacing between trees on the tree lawn is fifty feet.  The
exceptions to this rule would be the columnar types and small ornamentals such
as upright crab apples, where the spacing could be reduced.  Upright types are
used mainly on narrow tree lawns or where there is minimal space for crown
development.
   (c)   Trees shall typically be centered between the back of the curb and the
street-side edge of the sidewalk.  Some exceptions:
      (1)   Wide tree lawns allowing trees to be moved towards the sidewalk;
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs where no sidewalks will be installed;
      (3)   If utilities have installed a number of lines and cables
immediately back of the curb.
   (d)   Trees planted along the tree lawn to the right or left of the approach
to an intersection must not impede vision of pedestrians, bicyclists, street
signs, and motor vehicles.  Adequate line-of-sight distance must be given to
tree lawn signs (school crossing, parking etc.) in order that the later sign
clearance trimming can be kept to a minimum.  Greater line-of-sight distances
shall be provided at railroad crossings.
   (e)   New subdivision plantings are to be placed no closer than five feet
from gas and water shut-offs, driveways, fire hydrants, and property lot
lines.  All utility companies must be notified prior to any new subdivision
tree lawn planting.  List all planting locations and note the depth of the
planting holes and equipment to be used.
   (f)   Recommended street trees are listed in an official Shade Tree
Commission publication guide available in the City Safety-Service Director’s
Office.  The mature height and spread of a given tree type will determine the
planting distance from a street light.  The developer should also consider
height of overhead wires, tree lawn width, and soil types.
   (g)   Trees required to be planted by this section must be planted within
two years of approval of the final subdivision plat by the City.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)

feet from the point of intersection of said centerline with any public road or
highway, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall give notice, by registered mail
to the Director of Transportation that he shall not issue a zoning permit for
one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the notice is received by the
Director of Transportation.  If the Director of Transportation notifies the
Zoning Enforcement Officer that he shall proceed to acquire the land needed,

or structure until a Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall have been issued
thereof by the Zoning Enforcement Officer stating that the proposed use of the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.  The
issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance in no way relieves the recipient
from compliance with all the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and other
applicable regulations.
(Ord. 2007-38.  Passed 11-26-07.)
1153.07  TEMPORARY CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.

1152.01(128)
 
1154.01  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance or amendments that
may later be adopted there exists lots, uses of land, structures, and uses of
structures and land in combination which were lawful before this Zoning
Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance or future amendments.  It
is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1154.02  SUBSTITUTION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   So long as no structural alterations are made, except as required by
enforcement of other codes or ordinances, any nonconforming use may, upon
appeal to and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same classification or of a less intensive
classification, or the Board shall find that the use proposed for substitution
is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Board may require that
additional conditions and safeguards be met, which requirements shall pertain
as stipulated conditions to the approval of such change, and failure to meet
such conditions shall be considered a punishable violation of this Zoning
Ordinance.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a less intensive
use or becomes a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a
more intensive use.  However, in any residential district, no change shall be
authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals to any use which is not a permitted
or conditional use in any residential district.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1154.03  INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   Nonconformities are declared by this Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts in which such use is located.  A
nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended
or enlarged after passage of this Zoning Ordinance by attachment on a building
or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or
by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited
in the district in which such use is located.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1154.04  AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently.  Actual use is hereby defined to
include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
fastened in a permanent manner.  Where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
the work shall be carried out diligently.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1154.05  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (a)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance
or amendments thereto, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions
of this Zoning Ordinance.  Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.  This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that
yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or
both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which
such lot is located.  Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only
through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall
be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance, and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1154.06  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY).
   Where at the time of passage of this Zoning Ordinance lawful use of land
exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning
Ordinance, and where such use involves no individual structure with a
replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), the use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than one year, except when government action impedes access to
the premises, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such land is
located.
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of
land.
      (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
      
1154.07  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption of this
Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto, that could not be built under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance, except in the case of a damaged nonconforming residential structure
in any residential district which may be replaced and continued as a legal
nonconforming use within the limits otherwise provided under Section
1154.07.
   (c)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
 
1154.08  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURE OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATIONS.
   If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of one
thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, or of structure and premises in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or amendments
thereto, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
Zoning Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be as a special exception be changed
to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals either
by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, finds that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
   (e)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for one year except when government
action impedes access to the premises, the structure, or structure and premises
in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (f)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.  Destruction for the purpose of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%)
of the replacement cost at time of destruction.
      (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
 
1154.09  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months
on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, heating, air conditioning or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten
percent (10%) of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or
nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the
cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
   (b)   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
and maintenance, and is declared by any authorized official to be unsafe, or
unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored,
repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
   (c)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.  Where appropriate, a building permit for such activities shall
be required.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1154.10  USES UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS NOT  NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such
district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1154.11  CERTIFICATES FOR NONCONFORMING USES.
   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may upon his own initiative, or shall upon
the request of any owner, issue a certificate for any lot, structure, use of
land, use of structure, or use of land and structure in combination, that
certifies that the lot, structure or use is a valid nonconforming use.  The
certificate shall specify the reason why the use is a nonconforming use,
including a description of the extent and kind of use made of the property in
question, the portion of the structure or land used for the nonconforming use,
and the extent that dimensional requirements are nonconforming.  The purpose of
this section is to protect the owners of lands or structures that are or become
nonconforming.  No fee shall be charged for such a certificate.  One copy of
the certificate shall be returned to the owner and one copy shall be retained
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, who shall maintain as a public record a file
of all such certificates.

(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.07  BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS; PROCEDURE.
   Four (4) members of the Board shall constitute a quorum.  The Board shall
act by resolution, and the concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse an order of determination of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer, to decide in favor of an applicant in any matter over
which the Board has original jurisdiction under this Zoning Ordinance, or to
grant any variance from the requirements stipulated in this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 2014-08.  Passed 4-28-14.)
1155.08  BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS; POWERS AND DUTIES.
   In exercising its duties, the Board may, as long as such action is in
conformity with the terms of this Zoning Ordinance reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination appealed
from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought
to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the Zoning Enforcement
Officer from whom the appeal is taken.  For the purpose of this Zoning
Ordinance the Board has the following specific responsibilities:
   (a)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or determination made by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer.
   (b)   To authorize such variances from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as
will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to the special
conditions, a literal enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance will result in
unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this Zoning Ordinance shall be
observed and substantial justice done.
   (c)   To grant conditional use permits as specified in the Schedule of
District Regulations and under the conditions specified in Section
1155.22 and such additional safeguards as will uphold the intent of this Zoning
Ordinance.

      (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.09  DUTIES OF ZONING ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS,
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND COURTS OF MATTERS OF APPEALS.
   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer, and that such questions shall be presented to the Board
only on appeal from the decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, and that
recourse from the decisions of the Board shall be to the courts as provided by
law.  It is further the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that the duties of the
City Council in connection with this Zoning Ordinance shall not include hearing
and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise.  The
procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this section and
this Zoning Ordinance.  Under this ordinance the City Council shall have only
the duties of considering the adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of this Zoning Ordinance as provided by law, and of establishing a
schedule of fees and charges as stated in Section
1153.14.  Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be interpreted to prevent any
official of the City from appealing a decision of the Board to the courts as
provided in Chapters 2505 and 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  Any such appeal
shall be made within thirty (30) days of the Board's written decision.
(Ord. 2014-08.  Passed 4-28-14.)
1155.10  PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of
Sections
1155.11 to
1155.21 inclusive.  As specified in Section
1155.09, the Board of Zoning Appeals has appellate jurisdiction relative to
appeals and variances.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.11  APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning interpretation or
administration of this Zoning Ordinance may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by any officer or bureau of the legislative authority of the City affected by
any decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer.  Such appeal shall be taken
within twenty (20) days after the decision by filing, with the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and with the Board of Zoning Appeals, a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is being taken.  The Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals all the
papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.12  STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Zoning Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies
to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of appeal is filed with him,
that by reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.  In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice
to the Zoning Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken on due cause
shown.
(Ord. 2004-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.13  VARIANCE.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. 
No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance.  Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience,
financial hardship or profit, but only where strict application of the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.14  APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   Except as otherwise permitted in this Zoning Ordinance, no variance in the
strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be granted
by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless the Board shall find that the written
application for the requested variance contains all of the following
requirements.
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s).
   (b)   Legal description of property.
   (c)   Description or nature of variance requested.
   (d)   A fee as established by ordinance.
   (e)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating that the variance
conforms to the following standards:
      (1)   The granting of the variance shall be in accord with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Zoning Ordinance on the
district in which it is located, and shall not be injurious to the area or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
      (2)   The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of
any use which is not otherwise permitted in the district.
      (3)   There must exist special circumstances or conditions, fully
described in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which the
variance is sought, which are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not
apply generally to land or buildings in the area, and which are such that the
strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building.  Mere loss in value
shall not justify a variance; there must be deprivation of beneficial use of
land.
      (4)   There must be proof of hardship created by the strict application
of this Zoning Ordinance.  It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that
greater profit would result if the variance were granted.  Furthermore, the
hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on
this basis by one who purchases without knowledge of the restrictions; it must
result from the application of this Zoning Ordinance; it must be suffered
directly by the property in question; and evidence of variances granted under
similar circumstances need not be considered.
      (5)   The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of
the land or building, and the variance as granted is the minimum variance that
will accomplish this purpose.
      (6)   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.
      (7)   The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
         (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.15  SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in said district.  In granting
any appeal or variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance.  Violation
of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which
the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning
Ordinance and punishable under Section
1153.12.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.16  PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of an application for an appeal or variance from the
Zoning Enforcement Officer of an applicant. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.17  NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING IN NEWSPAPER.
   Before holding the public hearing required in Section
1155.16, notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of
general circulation of the City at least ten (10) days before the date of said
hearing.  The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing,
and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.  Failure of a newspaper to
accurately or timely publish a properly submitted notice does not invalidate
the granting or denial of a variance.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.18  NOTICE TO PARTIES IN INTEREST.
   Before holding the public hearing required in Section
1155.16, written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by the chairman of the
Board of Zoning Appeals, by first class mail, at least ten (10) days before the
day of the hearing to all parties in interest.  “All parties in interest” shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:  applicant, adjacent property
owners, and person(s) making the appeal. The notice shall consist of the same
information as required of notices published in newspapers as specified in
Section
1155.17.  Failure of any such property owner to receive mail notice does not
invalidate the granting or denial of a variance.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-
05.)
1155.19  ACTION BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing required in Section
1155.16, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1155.15, or disapprove the request for appeal or variance.  The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall further make a finding in writing that the reasons set forth in
the application justify the granting of the variance that will make possible a
reasonable use of the land, building or structure.  Appeals from Board decision
shall be made in the manner specified in Section
1155.09. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.20  TERM OF VARIANCE.
   No order of the Zoning Board of Appeals granting a variance shall be valid
for a period longer than twelve (12) months from the date of such order unless
the building permit or zoning approval is obtained within such period, and the
erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within
such period.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1155.21  AUTHORIZED VARIANCES.
   Variances from the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted
unless the Board makes specific findings of fact, based directly on the
particular evidence presented to it, which support conclusions that the
standards and conditions imposed in Section
1155.14 and Section
1155.15 if applicable, have been met by the applicant.  Variances may be
granted as guided by the following:
   (a)   To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback required
by the applicable regulations.
   (b)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but
generally the respective area and width of the lot or lots should not be less
than eighty (80) percent of the required area and width.
   (c)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required
facilities for two or more uses, provided that substantial use of such facility
by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same
days of the week.
   (d)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required, but generally by not more than thirty (30) percent of the required
facilities.
   (e)   To allow for the deferment of required parking facilities for a
reasonable period of time, such period of time to be specified in the variance.
   (f)   To increase the maximum distance that required parking spaces are
permitted to be located from the use served, but generally not more than forty
(40) percent.
   (g)   To increase the maximum allowable size or area of signs on a lot, but
generally by not more than twenty-five (25) percent.
   (h)   To increase the maximum gross floor area of any use so limited by the

that is listed or provided for in this Zoning Ordinance. If the Board finds
that a use is substantially similar to a specific use listed in this Zoning

use in relation to those uses specified by this Zoning Ordinance as being
permitted, or in the case of a conditional use, conditionally permitted, in
that district.

permitted or conditionally permitted use provided for in this Zoning Ordinance,
it shall then be permitted in the same manner and under the same conditions and
procedures as the use is permitted to which it has been found to be
substantially similar.

such use the record shall include the use as listed in the ordinance, the use
unlisted in the ordinance about which the determination of substantial
similarity was made, and the dates of any actions thereupon by the Board of

Enforcement Officer shall consult this record in the process of issuing future
permits.

section.
   (a)   Application and Development Plan.  An application shall be filed
seeking approval of the Planning Commission, together with five copies of a
comprehensive development plan including the elements provided for in Section
1163.02  (c)(2) and any additional information required by the Planning
Commission and Council, and a development approval fee as provided under
Section
1153.14 .
   (b)   Procedure for Approval.  The secretary of the Planning Commission
shall submit the application, and the comprehensive development plan to the
Planning Commission, the Engineering Department and other staff members, for
its review and recommendations.  In determining the acceptability of the
comprehensive development plan, the Planning Commission shall consider all
relevant factors including setbacks, distances between buildings, yard space,
suitability of open space systems, traffic accessibility, and other elements
having a bearing on the overall acceptability of the comprehensive development
plan as it relates to the orderly development of land within the City.  The
Planning Commission shall forward its recommendations to Council for final
approval or denial.  Council may return the application to the Planning
Commission for further study if additional information or facts are presented
to Council that were not available to the Planning Commission.  If the
application and comprehensive development plan shall be considered binding
conditions upon which development may proceed.
   (c)   The Development Plan as a Binding Condition.  Development shall be in
conformance with the comprehensive development plan and construction of site
improvements must be commenced within two years of Council approval, otherwise
no development of the land shall take place until a new comprehensive
development plan is approved pursuant to this section.  With the approval of
the Planning Commission, minor modifications of the approved comprehensive
development plan may be made.  Such modification shall not increase the overall
density of the site or change the essential character of the approved plan.  If
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed changes significantly
alter the approved plan, the plan must be resubmitted to Council for approval. 
Development of land shall not proceed prior to final approval of the
comprehensive development plan.  Any development undertaken without such final
approval is in violation of this Zoning Ordinance and an abatable nuisance.

1169(A).02  SITE PLAN REVIEW REQUIREMENTS.
   To ensure that the design standards contained in this District are achieved,
a site plan is required for all new development and significant revisions,
alterations, additions, or changes of use for existing structures.  “Expansion”
shall include a floor space increase of twenty-five percent (25%) or more.  All
site plans shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer, landscape
architect or architect.  The site plan submission shall be accompanied by a fee
in accordance with Section
1153.14.
   (a)   Procedure for Site Plan Review. 
      (1)   Formal submission and approval of a site plan is required before
any zoning permit may be issued.  However, at any time prior to the formal
submission and review of a site plan, an applicant may, at his or her option,
submit a sketch site plant to the Planning Commission for informal review and
comment.  The purpose of such a sketch site plan is to provide an opportunity
to conceptually discuss a proposed development and to provide general guidance
to assist in the preparation of a formal site plan.  A sketch site plan need
not include all items described in subsection (b) hereof, and informal review
of the site plan need not include the notifications required in this Section.
      (2)   An applicant for formal site plan approval shall file ten (10)
copies of a plan with the Zoning Enforcement Officer along with other required
documents and materials.  The Planning Commission shall review and approve a
site plan.
      (3)   After reviewing an application for completeness, and determining
that the proposed site plan is complete, a public hearing shall be held. 
Notice of the Hearing shall be made in a newspaper, and written notice shall be
given to all parties in interest (including all abutting property owners)
according to the procedures specified in Sections
1155.16 through
1155.18.  The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall transmit copies of the site plan
and application to the members of the Planning Commission along with other
departments and agencies as deemed necessary.  If all information required is
not provided, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall promptly notify the
applicant of the items needed.  Within thirty (30) days following the public
hearing, the Planning Commission shall meet and consider the proposed site
plan, and shall make a decision concerning:
         A.   The adequacy of the information presented to determine the
impacts of the proposed site;
         B.   The impacts of the proposed development compared to the standards
established under subsection (c) hereof and,
         C.   Whether to approve or deny the site plan, along with any
conditions or remedial measures to accommodate or mitigate the expected impacts
of the proposed development.
      (4)   The final action shall consist of either:
         A.   Approval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed plan will constitute a suitable development, and the plan meets the
standards set forth in this chapter;
         B.   Disapproval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed project does not meet the standards for review set forth in subsection
(c) hereof; or,
      (5)   If the site plan is disapproved, the specific basis for such
disapproval shall be provided along with a clear description of how the site
plan could be modified to be acceptable.

1172.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this District is to maintain a high character of community
development, to protect and preserve property, to promote the stability of
property values and to protect real estate from impairment or destruction of
value for the general community welfare by regulating the exterior historical
characteristics of structures throughout the hereinafter defined Historical
District.  It is the further purpose of this chapter to recognize and preserve
the distinctive historical and architectural character of this community which
has been greatly influenced by the architecture of an earlier period in this
community's history.  These purposes will be served by the regulation of
exterior design, use of materials, the finish grade line, landscaping and
orientation of all structures hereinafter altered, constructed, reconstructed,
erected, enlarged or remodeled in the hereinafter defined Historical District.
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)

   (a)   Whenever a structure, as defined by this Zoning Ordinance, whether
public or private, within the above described district is proposed to be
constructed or erected and whenever an existing structure is proposed to be
altered, reconstructed, enlarged or remodeled, if such alteration,
reconstruction, enlargement or remodeling involves the exterior design,

structure on the lot and the actual or proposed building setback lines.  In
addition, the application shall be accompanied by a detailed narrative
description of the proposed design or change of design, use of materials,
finish grade line, landscaping and orientation of the structure.  Except in
single-family residential zoning districts, applications for structures to be
constructed or remodeled, which remodeling would increase or decrease the total
gross building area by fifty percent (50%) or more, shall be accompanied by
appropriate, relevant colored elevations showing at a minimum, the design, use
of materials, finish grade line, landscaping and orientation of buildings and
any significant architectural features.  In addition, the Historical Review

which is accompanied by the material required by the provisions of subsection
(b) hereof, the Zoning Enforcement Officer or his designee shall place the
application on the agenda for the Commission at its next regular meeting
following ten days from the date the application is filed.  The Zoning

1172.05  STANDARDS FOR REVIEW; CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   The Historical Review Commission in deciding whether to issue a
certificate of appropriateness, shall determine that the application under
consideration promotes, preserves and enhances the distinctive historical
character of the community and would not be at variance with existing
structures within that portion of the district in which the structure is or is
proposed to be located as to be detrimental to the interests of the Districts
as set forth in Section
1172.01.  In conducting its review, the Commission shall make examination of
and give consideration to the elements of the application including, but not
necessarily limited to:
      (1)   Height.

of the individual window units and the overall harmonious relationship of
window openings.
      (4)   Exterior detail and relationships, which shall include all
projecting and receding elements of the exterior, including but not limited to,
porches and overhangs and the horizontal or vertical expression which is
conveyed by these elements.
      (5)   Roof shape, which shall include type, form and materials.
      (6)   Materials, texture and color, which shall include a consideration
of material compatibility among various elements of the structure.
      (7)   Compatibility of design and materials, which shall include the
appropriateness of the use of exterior design details.
      (8)   Landscape design and plant materials,  which shall include, in

features which enhance pedestrian movement and environment and which relate to
the pedestrian's visual perspective.
      (10)   Signage, which shall include, in addition to requirements of
Chapter
1175 , the appropriateness of signage to the building.
   (b)   In conducting its inquiry and review, the Commission may request from
the applicant such additional information, sketches and data as it shall
reasonably require.  It may call upon experts and specialists for testimony and
opinion regarding the matters under examination.  It may recommend to the
applicant changes in the plans that it considers desirable and may accept a
voluntary amendment to the application to include or reflect such changes.  The
Commission shall keep a record of its proceedings and shall append to the
application copies of information, sketches and data needed to clearly describe
any amendment to it.
   (c)   When its review is concluded, the Commission will determine by a vote
of its members, whether the application for a certificate of appropriateness
shall be approved.  If approved by four or more of its members, the Commission
shall return the application and appended material to the Zoning Enforcement
Officer with the instruction that the certificate of appropriateness be issued,
provided all other requirements for a building permit, if applicable, are met. 
The certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for one year from the date of
approval, or such extension as may be granted by the Commission.  If not
approved, the Commission shall return the application and appended material to
the applicant with a notice that the certificate of appropriateness shall not
be issued because the application did not meet the criteria and standards set
forth herein.  (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)

   (a)   Whenever a structure within the District is proposed to be demolished,
an application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with the
Zoning Enforcement Officer as provided in this chapter.  In considering such
application, the Historical Review Commission shall limit its inquiry to the
proposal for grading, landscaping and other design treatment of the property
once the structure has been removed.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the demolition
of a structure whether public or private, within the District. 
(Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)

1175.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these sign regulations is to encourage the proper development
and use of planned graphic signage systems and to regulate signs and signing
systems.  In addition to protection from distractions and obstructions that can
contribute to traffic and pedestrian accidents, it is the intent of these
regulations that signs are as much subject to control as noise, odors, debris
and like characteristics of a use that, if not controlled and regulated, can
become a nuisance factor to adjacent properties or the community in general. 
To protect the general health, safety and welfare, and to protect and encourage
a more attractive economic, business and overall physical appearance of the
community, all signs and signing systems are subject to the regulations that
follow in this chapter.

1175.10  NONCONFORMING AND ABANDONED SIGNS.
   (a)   The continuance of an existing sign which does not meet the
regulations and requirements of this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming
sign which shall terminate by abandonment.  A sign shall be considered
abandoned:
      (1)   When the sign is associated with an abandoned use.
      (2)   When the sign remains after the termination of a business.  A
business has ceased operations if it is closed to the public for at least
ninety consecutive days. Seasonal businesses are exempt from this
determination.
      (3)   When the sign is not maintained or does not conform to the
following:
         A.    All signs, together with all supports, braces, guys, and anchors
shall be kept in repair and in proper state of preservation.  The display
surfaces of all signs shall be subject to periodic inspection.
         B.   Every sign and the immediately surrounding premises shall be
maintained by the owner or person in charge thereof in a clean, sanitary and
inoffensive condition free and clear of all obnoxious substances, rubbish and
weeds.
      (4)   Abandonment shall be determined based upon the above definitions,
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the Property Maintenance Enforcement
Officer.  Upon a finding that the signage is abandoned, the right to maintain
and use such sign shall terminate immediately.
   (b)   A nonconforming sign shall not be structurally relocated or replaced
unless it is brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
Should any replacement or relocation take place without being brought into
compliance, the sign shall be existing illegally.
   (c)   A nonconforming sign shall be maintained or repaired in accordance
with the following provisions:
      (1)   The size and structural shape shall not be changed or altered.  The
copy may be changed provided that the change applies to the original
nonconforming use associated with the sign and that the change is made by the
owner of the sign at the time the sign became nonconforming; the copy area
shall not be enlarged.  Any subsequent owner or use shall bring the sign into
compliance within thirty days.
      (2)   In case damage occurs to the sign to the extent of fifty percent
(50%) or more of either the structure or the replacement value of the sign, the
sign shall be brought into compliance.  Where damage to the sign is less than
fifty percent (50%) of the structure or its replacement value, the sign shall
be repaired within sixty days.
   (d)   Removal of Abandoned Signs.  Upon the determination that a sign is
abandoned, the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the Property Maintenance
Enforcement Officer shall notify, in writing, the owner of the property on
which the sign is located.  Upon receiving notification that an abandoned sign
exists on the property, the owner shall have the abandoned sign removed within
thirty (30) days, or shall file an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals within
twenty (20) days under the procedure prescribed in Chapter
1155.11 .  The filing of such an appeal shall stay the time for removal of the
sign pending a final decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals. If thereafter the
property owner does not remove the sign, the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the
Property Maintenance Enforcement Officer shall take appropriate steps to have
the sign removed and bill the property owner.  If the bill is not paid, the
costs will be incorporated into a lien on the property and collected with
property taxes.
(Ord. 2018-04.  Passed 4-9-18.)
1175.11  NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGE EXEMPTION.
   Any sign, display, or device allowed under this ordinance may contain, in
lieu of any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that does
not direct attention to a business operated for profit, or to a commodity or
service for sale, and that otherwise complies with size, lighting, location and
spacing requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.

   It is the intent of this section to:
   (a)   Ensure the compatibility of home occupations with uses permitted in
the residential districts.
   (b)   Maintain and preserve the character of residential neighborhoods.
   (c)   Promote the efficient use of public services and facilities by
assuring these services are provided to the residential population for which
they were planned and constructed, rather than commercial uses.
      (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
      
1176.02  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   No home occupation may be carried on in a residential unit unless a
conditional use permit has first been issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   Written application for a home occupation permit shall be made to the
secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The application shall include:
      (1)   The address of the property, and the name, address and telephone
number of the owner and occupant of the property.
      (2)   A description of the home occupation sought to be carried on.
      (3)   The number and names of persons to be involved in the home
occupation.
      (4)   The length of time the home occupation is expected to be carried
on.
      (5)   Any additional information required by the Board of Zoning Appeals
to establish the advisability of granting the permit.
         (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1176.03  REGULATIONS.
   No home occupation permit shall be issued, and no home occupation shall be
carried on, unless the home occupation complies with all of the following
regulations:
   (a)   There shall be no on-site employment or use of labor from persons who
are not bona fide residents of the dwelling.  Home occupations shall be carried
on only by the occupant of the affected dwelling.
   (b)   No more than one home occupation shall be permitted within any single
dwelling unit.
   (c)   A home occupation shall be carried on wholly within the existing
structures located on the premises.  (Ord. 1994-02.  Passed 2-22-94.)
   (d)   The home occupation shall be incidental and subordinate to the
residential use of the premises.  Not more than twenty-five (25) percent or 500
square feet of the heated square footage of the premises shall be used in
conducting the home occupation.  Unheated square footage shall not be used in
conducting the home occupation or in determining square footage allowed.  Floor
area of a dwelling unit, in this case, shall include the floor area of all
heated and ventilated and thereby habitable rooms and areas within the dwelling
unit including basements and habitable attic space.
   (e)   There shall not be conducted on the premises the business of selling
stocks or merchandise, supplies, or products, provided that orders previously
made by telephone or at a sales party may be filled on the premises.  That is,
direct sales of products off display shelves or racks is not allowed, but a
person may pick up an order placed earlier as described above.  Only goods and
service produced or provided on the premises may be sold on the premises.
   (f)   The home occupation may not generate traffic in greater volume than
normal for a residential neighborhood.  The number of deliveries, pick-ups,
origin or destination trips, or customer/client visits relating to the
occupational or professional use of the premises shall not exceed five per
day.  Any need for parking generated by the home occupation shall conform to
the off-street parking requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, and shall not be
located in a required front yard.  The home occupation shall not cause the
elimination of required off-street parking.
   (g)   Conditional use permits shall not be granted when it appears the
proposed home occupations will constitute a fire hazard to neighboring
residences, will adversely affect neighboring property values, or will
constitute a nuisance or otherwise be detrimental to the neighbors because of
excessive traffic, excessive noise, odors, or other circumstances.
   (h)   Signage indicating the occupational or professional use of the
premises is prohibited.  The residential character of the dwelling shall be
preserved and no structural alterations, construction features or site features
of a nonresidential nature shall be incorporated.  Any vehicle which is used in
conjunction with the home occupation or profession, except for noncommercial
personal vehicles bearing no advertising of the home occupation or profession
must be garaged.  No accessory buildings shall be used for the home occupation
or profession.
   (i)   If the occupation is conducted in a single-family residence, no
equipment or process may be used in the home occupation which creates noise,
vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical interference detectable to the
normal senses off the lot.  If the occupation is conducted in other than a
single-family residence, such noise, vibration glare, fumes, odors, or
electrical interference shall not be detectable to the normal senses outside of
the dwelling unit.  In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or
process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any radio
or television receivers or electronic devices off the premises, or causes
fluctuations in line voltage off the premises.  There shall be no increased
burden placed upon existing City services provided to the residence as a result
of a home occupation. 
      (Ord. 2005-34.  Passed 12-12-05.)
1176.04  ENFORCEMENT AND REVOCATION OF HOME OCCUPATION PERMIT.
   The following shall be considered as grounds for the revocation of a home
occupation permit or for the assessment of fines as specified.
   (a)   Any change in use or any change in extent of use, area of the dwelling
unit being used, or mechanical or electrical equipment being used that is
different from that specified in the granted home occupation permit form that
is not first cleared and approved by the building official shall be grounds for
the revocation of a home occupation permit.
   (b)   Any change in use, extent of use, area of the dwelling unit being
used, or mechanical or electrical equipment being used that results in
conditions not in accordance with the provisions of Section
1176.03, shall result in immediate revocation of the home occupation permit.
   (c)   Failure to allow periodic inspections by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer or his designee at any reasonable time when an adult member of the
family is present shall result in the immediate revocation of the home
occupation permit.

1317.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Mount Vernon, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Mount Vernon has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Mount Vernon as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Mount Vernon.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Knox County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Knox County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective July 7, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Mount Vernon as required by Section
1317.04(c).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file the City Hall at 40 Public Square Mount Vernon, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Mount Vernon, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 2009-
19.  Passed 5-26-09.)
1317.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Mount Vernon's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Mount Vernon
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 2, 1982, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.

Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include  the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main

addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Mount Vernon suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Mount Vernon has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1317.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. 
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Mount Vernon specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1317.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1317.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Mount Vernon Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby
appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
City Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the City
Hall at 40 Public Square Mount Vernon, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Mount
Vernon. 
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2) A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Knox County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 2009-19.  Passed 5-
26-09.)
1317.06  ENFORCEMENT.

constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1317.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order

1323.01  PURPOSE.
   This Chapter is adopted to establish a program for identifying and
registering vacant commercial, industrial and institutional buildings within
the City that may present a fire hazard, that may provide temporary occupancy
by transients, that may detract from private and/or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and that may present a hazard
to the health, safety and welfare of the public. Through a registration,
inspection, and monitoring process, vacant commercial, industrial and
institutional buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from trespassers,
will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in times of
emergency, will not impede private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or
maintain surrounding buildings, and will not otherwise present a public hazard
so that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by these
regulations.

paid during the year in which the building was approved for re-occupancy.
Registration fees paid in previous years shall not be refunded.
   (d)    If a registration form is filed late, an additional late fee shall be
paid in addition to the annual registration fee and shall be equal to the

registration fee to the Knox County Auditor.  In addition to the registration
fee, an interest rate equal to the current statutory interest rate shall be
imposed by the City on special assessments for the life of the registration
fee, added to the registration fee, and collected as provided in this section.
The City Auditor shall then certify the amount of the registration fee,
