PREFACE 

The Town of Jaffrey has, like other municipalities, passed through the struggles that characterized all American communities in their early history.  While only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of incorporation, subsequent growth of the community, together with the complexity of modern life, has created the need for more and detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the town.  The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace.  The orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process.  Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records.  They must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the town ordered the following codification. 
Contents of Code 
The various chapters of the Code contain currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the Town of Jaffrey.  Each piece of legislation has been included as a separate chapter or Article, renumbered and stylized consistent with the style of the Code, without any substantive change. 
Division of Code 
The Code is divided into parts.  Part 1, Administrative Legislation, contains town legislation of an administrative nature, namely, that dealing with the administration of government, that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments.  Part II, General Legislation, contains other town legislation of a regulatory nature. Legislation in this part generally imposes penalties for violation of its provisions, whereas that in Part I does not. 
Grouping of Legislation and Arrangement of Chapters 
The legislation is organized into chapters, the order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another.  Wherever there are two or more pieces of legislation dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a single chapter.  Thus, for example, all legislation dealing with sewers may be found in Part II, in Chapter 159, Sewers, while all legislation pertaining to taxation may be found in Part II, in Chapter 181, Taxation.  In such chapters, use of Article designations has preserved the identity of the individual pieces of legislation. 
Table of Contents 
The Table of Contents details the arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation.  Wherever two or more pieces of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter, titles of the several Articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual pieces of legislation. 
Reserve Chapters 
Space has been provided for the convenient insertion, alphabetically, of later enactments. In the Table of Contents such space appears as chapters titled “(Reserved)”.  In the body of the Code, reserved space is provided by breaks in the page-numbering sequence between chapters. 
Pagination 
A unique page-numbering system has been used, in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit.  One hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter, and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals “Ol.” Thus, Chapter 23 begins on page 2301, Chapter 92 on page 9201, etc.  By use of this system, it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization. 
Numbering of Sections 
A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed, in which each section of every piece of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter.  Thus, the first section of Chapter 29 is § 29-1, while the fifth section of Chapter 147 is § 147-5. 
Scheme 
The Scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter. These titles are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter.  Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section.  For ease and precision of reference, the Scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text. 
Histories 
At the end of the Scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter.  This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived, including the date of adoption.  In the case of chapters containing Articles derived from more than one piece of legislation, the source of each Article is indicated in the History. 
Because, as in many older municipalities, early records are often incomplete or imprecise, some of the legislation included in the Code of the Town of Jaffrey lacks verifiable adoption dates.  Early records of the Board of Selectmen occasionally make no reference to a date of adoption. 
In most cases, enactments of the Board of Selectmen bear effective dates which are also the date of adoption; however, this relationship of dates can not always be verified.  In some cases, the enactments bear only the dates or which the enactments were recorded.  While it is clear that all of these enactments were adopted, as the Selectmen signed them to indicate their acceptance, the official date of adoption could not be determined. In such instances, the History reflects these circumstances by indicating that the legislation in question was approved by the Board of Selectmen and also provides the effective date or date of recording of such legislation. 
For simplicity and clarity in section histories, the following abbreviations for legislating bodies have been used: 
ATM -Annual Town Meeting. 
STM -Special Town Meeting. 
General References; Editor’s Notes 
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of General References is included to direct the reader’s attention to such related chapters.  Editor’s notes are used in the text to provide supplementary information and cross references to related provisions in other chapters. 
Appendix 
Certain forms of local legislation do not fall into the categories established for Parts I and II of the Code, but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government.  The Appendix of this Code is reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include. 
Index 
The Index is a guide to information.  Since it is likely that this Code will be used by persons without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a particular section quickly.  Each section of each chapter has been indexed.  The Index will be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to the Code. 
Supplementation 
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation.  New legislation and amendments will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible after passage. Supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are received, and old pages removed, in accordance with the instruction page which accompanies each supplement. The Code of the Town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire will be updated at least once annually to ensure that policy makers, citizens and staff have access to all current town regulations in one location. 
The only ordinances not included in this code are the following land use regulations: 
Zoning Ordinance 
Floodplain Development Ordinance 
Shoreland Overlay District 
Site Plan Review Regulations 
Rules and Regulations to Control Subdivisions 
Historic District Regulations 
Regulations Governing Earth Excavations 
Wetlands Conservation District Ordinance 
Manufactured Housing/Mobile Home Park Regulations 

The Ordinances are updated periodically in a document entitled Jaffrey Zoning Ordinances and available through the Planning Office.  These ordinances are included in this Code by reference only.

Communication and Social Media Policy & Guidelines 
[Adopted 7-24-2017 by the Jaffrey Select Board] 

The Town of Jaffrey strives to provide its citizens and the general public accurate and timely information, communicated in a professional manner and in accordance with public access laws. The Town has several objectives when doing so: 
• 	
To effectively inform citizens and municipal officials about the Town of Jaffrey. 

• 	
To provide timely notice and information regarding municipal meetings, events or issues of importance to our citizens. 

• 	
To demonstrate the value and services the Town of Jaffrey provides. 

• 	
To engage the community and foster an effective relationship between the Town and its citizens. 


This policy provides guidelines for all external communications from the Town of Jaffrey using various media including: 
• 	
Electronic information tools such as the Town of Jaffrey website, municipally related websites or social media sites. 

• 	
Printed materials produced by the town for citizen education efforts. 

• 	
Media relations such as requests for interviews, news releases and media inquiries. 

• 	
Direct contact with citizens or other members of the general public. 


General Guidelines for All Communication 
Town of Jaffrey employees have a responsibility to help communicate accurate and timely information to staff and the public in a professional manner.  Any employee who identifies a mistake in reporting should bring the error to the attention of the author or other appropriate staff. 
Handling General Requests:  Staff is responsible for communicating basic and routine information to the public in relation to their specific job duties.  Requests for private data or information outside of the scope of an individual’s job duties should be routed to the appropriate department or to the employee’s supervisor. 
Handling Media Requests:  Except for basic information that is readily available to the public, requests for interviews or information from the media should be routed to the appropriate Department Head or Town Manager.  Media requests include contact from those who say they represent any form of media, including print publications, television, radio and informational websites. 
6201 

Electronic and Social Media Communication 
The Town of Jaffrey communicates to citizens and the public via its website.  www.townofjaffrey.com is our primary internet presence.  Social media includes sites such as Facebook, Twitter and others.  The town recognizes members of the public increasingly gather information through these and other electronic sites.  Therefore, it is necessary to use these tools to communicate effectively and fully. 
The best and most appropriate use of social media generally fall into three categories: 
• 	
Disseminate time-sensitive material quickly. 

• 	
Enhance the Town of Jaffrey’s ability to put its messages before the widest audience possible. 

• 	
Initiate transparent conversations among the town, the media and citizens. 


The Town of Jaffrey recognizes the instantaneous, yet permanent, nature of these electronic tools can pose risk without effective controls.  The key point for consideration is information and statements posted on websites and through social media directly reflect on the Town of Jaffrey. Therefore, great care should be exercised when posting.  The Town of Jaffrey will post its Facebook page as a non-interactive, public & government service page where outside posts are limited. 
Communication via electronic and social media on behalf of the Town of Jaffrey can only be done by Department Heads or designated staff. 
Personal Communication 
It is important for employees to remember that some personal communication may reflect on the Town of Jaffrey, especially when commenting on anything political in nature; federal, state or local government activities; or, Town of Jaffrey business.  The following guidelines apply to personal communication including various forms of social media, letters to the editor of newspapers, or personal endorsements: 
• 	
What you write is public and may be for a long time.  It may spread to large audiences.  Use common sense when using email or social media sites. It is a good idea to refrain from sending or posting information you would not want your supervisor or other employees to read, or that you would be embarrassed to see in a newspaper or on a prominent website. 

• 	
The Town of Jaffrey expects its employees to be truthful, courteous and respectful toward coworkers, citizens, customers and other people associated with the town.  Do not engage in name-calling or personal attacks. 

• 	
In the workplace, town employees should always identify themselves as such during official communication. 


6202 

• 	
Town of Jaffrey resources and working time should not be used for personal profit or business interests, or to participate in personal political activity. 

• 	
Personal social media account names or email names should not be tied to the Town of Jaffrey. 


This guideline does not supersede the Employee Handbook’s Electronic Usage Policy.

GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ZONE – ELITE LAUNDRY 
I. General 
Having determined that health and safety of the people of the Town of Jaffrey requires restrictions at this time on the use of groundwater in areas impacted by the release of hazardous materials from the former Elite Laundry site, the Health Officer of the Town of Jaffrey has promulgated this regulation.  The regulation has been duly approved by the Board of Selectmen and constitutes a valid health safety regulation issued pursuant RSA 147:1. 
As a requirement of the hazardous materials remediation of the former Elite Laundry site, located at 4, 6, & 10 Laundry Way, Jaffrey, NH (M238: L292, L290, & L290-01),  DES Site #199908001, the Town has applied for and been issued a Groundwater Management Permit (“Permit”).  Per RSA 485-C:6-b and with the approval of the NH Department of Environmental Services, in lieu of recording notice of the Permit with the Cheshire County Registry of Deeds for each lot within the Groundwater Management Zone (GMZ), the Town shall implement this regulation as an alternative form of notice. 
The Permit establishes a GMZ, an area within which groundwater use must be controlled and monitored due to the presence of groundwater contaminants that exceed the State’s Ambient Groundwater Quality Standards (“AGQS”). For the former Elite Laundry site, the GMZ means the subsurface area in which groundwater contamination associated with a discharge is contained. The Permit includes conditions to and restrictions upon the use of the properties within the GMZ, including restrictions on the use of groundwater. 
The Permit was issued on September 14, 2016 and expires on September 13, 2021, unless renewed for subsequent five-year period(s). The Permit is available for review at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, 29 Hazen Drive, Concord, NH 03301, or can be viewed online by searching under the Department’s OneStop data and Information Site at http://www2.des.state.nh.us/DESOnestop/BasicSearch.aspx. 
The “Groundwater Management Zone” defining the limit of included properties is depicted on the map dated (March, 2016) drawn by Tighe and Bond, the Town’s consultant for the clean-up of the site.  The map of the GMZ shall be kept on file with the Jaffrey Town Clerk.

An application and connection fee (specific fees are available from the Town’s Schedule of Fee’s as the Town may revise from time to time) shall be paid to the Town at the time the application is filed. A copy of the approved Application for Sewer Service signed by the Director will serve as evidence of approval and is available upon request at the Director’s office. For an establishment discharging industrial wastes, an application shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Article IV of this Ordinance. 
C. 	The Town will, at its expense during construction of a new public sewer or sewer extension by the Town, construct a sewer stub for a building or proposed building located on a lot of record, if such building or proposed building is accessible to the existing public sewer, and therefore is required to connect to the public sewer as provided in paragraph 2.1(I), above. All costs including application and connection fees and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the remainder of the building sewer, including connection to the structures served, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the improved property to be connected. The owner(s) shall indemnify the Town from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.  
D. 	After the initial construction of the building sewer, the owner shall thereafter be obligated to pay all costs of expenses of operation, repair, and maintenance and of reconstruction (if needed) of the entire building sewer beginning at the public sewer and ending at the building. If Town personnel are called out to work on the public sewer and it is subsequently determined that the problem was on the property owner’s section of the line, the property owner will reimburse the Town for all costs associated with the service call. 
E. 	If the owner of any building located within the Town and benefited, improved, served or accommodated by any public sewer, or to which any public sewer is available, after ninety (90) days’ notice from the Town, in accordance with paragraph 2.1(I), shall fail to connect such building as required, the owner shall be in violation of this Ordinance and the Town may make such connection and may collect from such owner the costs and expenses thereof by such legal proceeding as may be permitted by law. The Town shall have full authority to enter on owner's property to do whatever is necessary to properly drain the improved property into the public sewer.

The force main shall be 
sized to maintain flow velocities of three (3') feet per second and shall be furnished with 
adequate valving to provide shut off capability and protection against reverse flows and a cleanout shall be installed at the service connection. Wherever possible, force mains shall be designed to transition to a gravity sewer prior to connection to the public sewer main. Building sewers shall not be connected through a manhole except as provided by Section 2.3(I). In all instances, during construction, a cleanout shall be installed at the property line at the end of the sewer stub (service) or street lateral and at the building sewer connection. The cleanout shall include a detectable metal cover. 
I. 	When any street lateral is to serve a school, hospital, or similar institutional or public housing, or is to serve a complex of industrial or commercial buildings, or which in the opinion of the Director, will receive sanitary sewage or industrial wastes of such volume or character that frequent maintenance of said building sewer and street lateral is anticipated, then such street lateral shall be connected to the public sewer through a manhole. The Director shall determine if and where this type of connection to the public sewer is required. Connections to existing manholes shall be made as directed by the Director. If required, a new manhole shall be installed in the public sewer. Industrial or commercial connections may be required to construct access manholes for sampling purposes at the sole discretion of the Town (Section 3.2(F)).

The depth of cover over the pipe shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, but in no case shall such depth be less than four feet (4') unless prior approval has been granted by the Director, in writing to permit a lesser depth of cover. In such cases a rigid 2-inch insulation board shall be installed over the pipe. 
P. 	All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with warning signs, traffic controls, barricades, and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Town at the expense of the owner. It is the responsibility of the owner to coordinate work with the Town by providing written notification of any proposed work prior 
to initiation of excavation and comply with all requirements of the Town’s street opening permit 
or NHDOT permit to work within the right-of-way and DIGSAFE. 
Q. 	An interior clean-out fitting and backwater valve at the discretion of the Director shall be provided for each building lateral at a readily accessible location, preferably just inside the basement wall. The fitting shall contain a forty-five degree (45o) branch with a removable watertight plug, and so positioned that sewer cleaning equipment can be inserted therein to clean the building lateral. Buildings and mobile homes without foundations shall have a clean-out installed on the outside and installed at the street line. 
R. 	No structure shall be connected to the sanitary sewer system unless there is a vent pipe extending to a point above the roof and properly vented or otherwise vented as per applicable codes and code enforcement offices in a manner approved by the Director. Vents shall be installed by the owner in all buildings as approved by the Building Inspector. No person shall obstruct the free flow of air through any drain or soil pipe. 
S. 	Grease, oil, and/or sand interceptors shall be installed where the Town or its duly authorized agent shall direct, and shall be maintained at the owner’s expense. These shall be installed outside unless waived by the Director. 
T. 	No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, interior or exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. 
U. 	The owner(s) or their agent shall notify the Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. Such notice shall be provided not less than seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the time any connection is to be made to any public sewer.  The contractor shall be responsible for satisfying all other notification requirements, including DIGSAFE. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the Director or his representative. No building sewer or repair thereto shall be covered until it has been inspected and approved by the Town. If any part of a building sewer is covered before so being inspected and approved, it shall be uncovered for inspection at the cost and expense of the owner of the building to be connected to a sewer. This requirement shall also apply to repairs or alterations to building connections, drains or pipes thereto. Premature filling of trenches before an inspection is made will subject the owner(s) to opening the trench for inspection or a penalty in accordance with this Ordinance. 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

Failure of inspection may result in actions through code enforcement up to and including withholding a Certificate of Occupancy or discontinuing of services. 
V. 	Suitable provisions shall be made at the point of connection for testing, which responsibility shall rest with the owner(s). 
W. 	The Director shall maintain a record of all connections made to public sewers and drains under this Ordinance and all repairs and alterations made to building connections or drains connected to or discharging into public sewers and drains of the Town or intended to so discharge. All persons concerned shall assist the Director in securing data needed for such records. 
X. 	Proposed new discharges from residential or commercial sources involving loadings exceeding fifty (50) population equivalents (5,000 gpd); any new industrial waste, or any alteration in either flow or waste characteristics of greater than twenty percent (20%) of existing industrial wastes that are being discharged into the POTW, and that could cause interference with the POTW or have an adverse effect on the receiving water or otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance, shall be approved by the NHDES Water Division.  Approvals for industrial waste shall be obtained in accordance with Article IV of this Ordinance. 
Y. 	If the owner of any building located within the Town shall fail or refuse, upon receipt of a notice of the Town, in writing, to remedy any unsatisfactory condition with respect to a building sewer, within forty-five (45) days of receipt of such notice (except this time period may be reduced as necessary to protect the health and safety of the residents of the Town), the Town may remedy any unsatisfactory condition with respect to a building sewer and may collect from the owner the costs and expenses thereof by such legal proceedings as may be provided by law. The Town shall have full authority to enter on the owner's property to do whatever is necessary to remedy the unsatisfactory condition. 
Z. 	Every building sewer shall be maintained in a sanitary and safe operating condition by the owner. 
AA. 	When a building is demolished and not immediately replaced, the owner shall adequately seal off his building sewer where it connects to the public sewer. 
Section 2.4 New Sewers or Sewer Extensions 
A. 	New sanitary sewers and all extensions to sanitary sewers owned and maintained by the Town shall be properly designed in accordance with the NHDES Administrate Rules Env-Wq 700: Standards of Design and Construction for Sewerage and Wastewater Treatment Facilities and in strict conformance with all requirements of the NHDES. Plans and specifications shall be submitted to, and approval obtained from, the Director and the Town and the NHDES before construction may proceed. The design of sewers shall anticipate and allow for flows from all possible future extensions or developments within the immediate drainage area. 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

B. 	When a property owner, builder, or developer proposes to construct sanitary sewers or extensions to sanitary sewers in an area proposed for subdivision, the plans, specifications, and method of installation shall be subject to the approval of the Director in accordance with paragraph 2.3(A). Said property owner, builder or developer shall pay for the entire installation, including appropriate share of the cost of treatment plant, intercepting or trunk sewers, pumping stations, force mains and all other Town expenses incidental thereto based on volume and plant capacity, as determined by the Town. Each building sewer shall be installed and inspected pursuant to Section 2.3 and all application and inspection fees shall be paid by the applicant. Design and installation of sewers shall be as specified in and in conformance with paragraphs 3 through 6 of ASTM Specification C-12. Plugged service wye fittings shall be provided along sewer extensions in locations approved by the Director to accommodate future connections from existing unimproved lots. The installation of the sewer shall be subject to periodic inspection by the Director, and the expense for this inspection shall be paid for by the owner, builder, or developer as provided in this local law. The Director's decisions shall be final in matters of quality and methods of construction. The sewer, as constructed, must pass an exfiltration test approved by the Town before any building sewer is connected thereto. Plans, specifications, and other required information shall be submitted forty-five (45) days in advance of anticipated project start date. The Town shall be notified at least thirty (30) days in advance of the start of construction operations so that such inspection procedures as may be necessary or required may be established. No sanitary sewers will be accepted by the Town until such inspection of construction has been made as will assure the Town of compliance with these regulations and any amendments or additions thereto. The Town has the right to utilize outside inspectors, the cost for which shall be paid for by the developer. Upon completion of construction, as-built drawings shall be provided to the Director. 
C. 	Plans, specifications, and methods of installation shall conform to the requirements of this Local law. Components and materials of POTW installations not covered in this Ordinance such as pumping stations, lift stations, or force mains shall be designed in accordance with Section 2.3 and shall be clearly shown and detailed on the plans and specifications submitted for approval.  When requested, the owner, builder, or developer of the proposed installation shall submit to the Town all design calculations and other pertinent data to supplement a review of the plans and specifications. Costs associated with the Town’s review of the plans and specifications, and any NHDES design review fees shall be paid by the property owner, builder, or developer. 
Section 2.5 Variances 
A. 	The Town Manager, with recommendation of Director, may allow reasonable variances from the provisions of Sections 2.1 through 2.4 of this Ordinance upon approval of the Board of Selectmen, which will not result in a violation of State or federal law, provided: 
1. 	
The owner pays a monthly variance fee as determined by the Board of Selectmen and published in the Schedule of Fees. 

2. 	
The variance allowed is the least variance reasonable; 

3. 	
The variance will not cause undue harm or inconvenience to the Town, the POTW, or the owner's neighbors; and 

4. 	
The variance is justified by substantial reason. 



JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

B. 	The owner shall apply for the variance in writing to the Town Manager. The application shall identify the name and address of the owner, the property in question, the specific variance sought by the owner and a substantial reason justifying the variance.  The variance fee shall be paid with the application or the variance shall be deemed to have been denied. The variance as issued shall identify any changes, limitations or restrictions on the variance as applied for. 
Section 2.6 Prohibited Discharge Standards 
A. 	General Prohibitions. No person shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater that causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other Federal, State, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.

C. 	Additional Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following substances, pollutants or wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the Director in an IDP: 
1. 	
Wastewater that imparts color that might not be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently could impart color to the treatment facility's effluent, thereby violating the Town's NPDES permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the compensation point for photosynthetic activity by more than ten percent (10%) from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life; 

2. 	
Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater that, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, could be sufficient to create a public nuisance, objectionable odors, or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the public sewers for maintenance or repair;

8. 	
Garbage that has not been shredded to such a degree that all particles will be transported freely under the flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particles greater than one-half inch (1/2”) in any direction. (Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by caterers.  The installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of 3/4 horsepower [0.76 horsepower metric] or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director.); 

9. 	
Any quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a "slug" as defined herein; 

10. 	
Waters or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the treatment works, release dangerous or noxious gases or objectionable odors, form suspended solids that affect the operation of the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes; 

11. 	
Any materials that exert or cause unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime, slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate); and 

12. 	
Wastewater containing any pollutant at a concentration that exceeds a local limit or IDP limit established for that pollutant by the Town. 


D. 	Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this article shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
Section 2.7 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards 
The Federal categorical pretreatment standards are found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405­471 and are hereby incorporated into the Ordinance.  
A. 	Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limitations in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
B. 	When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
C. 	A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
D. 	A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 
403.15. 
The Town provides timely notification to identified industrial users of applicable categorical pretreatment standards. Upon promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this Ordinance for sources in that subcategory, shall, on the compliance date of the categorical pretreatment standards, immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Ordinance. 
Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards shall be achieved within three (3) years of the date such standards are effective, unless a shorter compliance schedule is specified in the standards. 
An industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall not discharge wastewater directly or indirectly to the Town's POTW subsequent to the compliance date of such standards unless an amendment to its IDP has been issued by the Town.  
Section 2.8 Local Discharge Restrictions 
All persons discharging industrial wastes into public or private sewers connected to the Town's POTW shall comply with applicable Federal requirements and State standards for pretreatment of wastes (as amended) in addition to the requirements of this Ordinance. 
Local numerical, Federal and regulatory controls established by the Town for the discharge of pollutants of concern as set forth herein (referred to as "local limits"), and all State pretreatment standards shall apply, whichever is most stringent. Pollutants of concern include any pollutants that might reasonably be expected to be discharged to the POTW in quantities that could pass through or interfere with the POTW, contaminate the biosolids, or adversely impact human health or safety. 
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the POTW that exceed the standards or restrictions established in Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of this Ordinance, which in the judgment of the Director may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or that otherwise create a hazard to human safety or health, or constitute a public nuisance, the Director will notify the Town Manager who may: 
. 	Reject or prevent any discharge to the POTW after making a reasonable attempt to serve notice 
to the user and giving the user a reasonable opportunity to respond; . Require pretreatment prior to discharge to the POTW (Article III); . Require control (e.g., equalization) over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or . Require payment to cover additional costs of handling and treating the wastes. 
If the Director allows the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the systems and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director and the State (see Article III). 
A. 	Maximum allowable industrial mass loading limitations. The Director will not issue permits that in combination with other industrial loads exceed the values in the table located in Appendix I of this Ordinance. 
All mass loading limitations for metals represent total metals, regardless of the valance state, or the physical or chemical form of the metal. To administer these allowable loadings through IDPs, the Director will impose concentration-based limitations, or mass limitations, or both, on a case-by-case basis into site-specific IDPs. For industrial users, the values written into IDPs for the above pollutants shall apply at the end of the industrial wastestream and prior to dilution with non-industrial wastewaters. 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

Unless specifically identified in an IDP, an industrial user is not allowed to discharge the locally limited pollutants at concentrations significantly greater than background concentrations. For the purposes of this requirement, significant means 67.9 percent (67.9%) greater than the background concentrations used for local limits development. 
Daily concentration (or mass loading) is the concentration (or mass) of a pollutant discharged, determined from the analysis of a flow-composite sample (or other sampling procedure approved by the Director) representative of the discharge over the duration of a 24-hour day or industrial operating schedule of less than twenty-four (24) hours. 
B. 	Screening Levels. Screening levels are numerical values above which actions are initiated to evaluate, prevent, or reduce adverse impacts on the POTW, the environment, and/or human health and safety. The Town monitors industrial sources of conservative pollutant-bearing discharges in comparison to established uniform concentration values, and authorization to discharge at greater concentrations may be granted subject to the administrative procedures for managing mass loading limitations. Uniform concentration values for conservative pollutants will be maintained by the Town, independent of this Ordinance, to provide regulatory flexibility. 
Screening levels for non-conservative pollutants are concentration-based values that, if exceeded, represent a potential to compromise worker safety, create flammability or chemical reactivity conditions in the collection system, or result in operational issues such as excessive organic/solids loadings. Screening levels for non-conservative pollutants are developed as needed using the methodology of the Town’s local limits study. The data in the table located in Appendix II of this Ordinance are representative of non-conservative pollutants and the concentrations above which they shall not be discharged to the POTW without approval of the Director. 
If any of the screening levels are exceeded, repeat analysis may be required by the Town to verify compliance or noncompliance with that screening level. If noncompliance is indicated, then the industrial user may be required, at the discretion of the Director, to conduct an appropriate engineering evaluation at the industrial user’s expense to determine the potential impact of the discharge of this pollutant to the Town's POTW or alternatively, to develop a pollution prevention plan specifically addressing the pollutant that exceeds the screening level.  This study or plan shall be approved by and conducted under the supervision of the Town.  Should the evaluation indicate the impact to be unsatisfactory, the industrial user shall reduce the pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level. If the evaluation supports development of an alternate site-specific limitation, then the screening level may, at the discretion of the Director, be adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user and administered as a permit limitation for the specific discharge. 
If an industrial user proposes to discharge at concentrations greater than the concentration-based screening level maintained by the Town, then the industrial user may be required to conduct the evaluations described in the previous paragraph. Should the evaluations support an alternate site-specific limitation, then the screening level may, at the discretion of the Director, be adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user and administered as a permit limitation for the specific discharge. 
C. 	Best Management Practices. The Town may develop or require the development of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to implement Sections 2.6 and 2.8. Such BMPs shall be considered local limits and Pretreatment Standards for the purposes of this Ordinance. 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

D. 	Special Agreements. No statement contained in this article except for paragraphs 2.6(A), 2.6(B), and Section 2.7 shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Town and any industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Town for treatment provided that said agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing Federal or State laws, and/or regulations promulgated hereunder, are compatible with any User Charge System or Schedule of Fees in effect, and do not waive applicable Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Special agreement requests may require submittal of a pollution prevention plan that specifically addresses the discharge for which a special agreement is requested.  
Section 2.9 Town’s Right of Revision 
The discharge standards and requirements set forth in Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 are established for the purpose of preventing discharges to the POTW that would harm either the public sewers, wastewater treatment process, or equipment; would have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or would otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. 
To meet these objectives, the Director may, from time to time, review and recommend to the Town Manager and Board of Selectmen more stringent standards or requirements than those established in Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 if, in his opinion, such more stringent standards or requirements are necessary to meet the above objectives. At a minimum, this review will be performed at least once every five (5) years. In forming his opinion, the Director may give consideration to such factors as the quantity of waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment facility, degree of treatability at the wastewater treatment facility, pollution prevention activities, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer shall not be exceeded without the approval of the Director. 
The Director shall allow affected industrial users reasonable time to comply with any changes to the local limits. The conditions and schedule for compliance shall accompany the written notification of amended local limits. 
Section 2.10 Dilution 
No user shall ever increase the use of water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on users to discourage the use of dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
Section 2.11 Mass-Based Limitations 
Users implementing process changes may request that compliance be determined based on mass limitations in lieu of concentration limitations. Such mass-based limitations will be calculated from the permitted concentration-based limitations and flows, and shall be equivalent to or less than the mass discharge in effect at the time of the request. The intent of a mass-based limit is to encourage and allow pollution prevention and/or water conservation measures that might cause a facility to increase pollutant concentrations in their discharge even though the total mass of the pollutant discharged does not increase, and may in fact decrease. Decisions on granting requests for mass-based compliance limitations will be based on user-specific information and current operating conditions of the POTW, and will be at the 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

discretion of the Director. Implementation of mass-based limitations may not contravene any requirements of Federal or State laws and/or regulations implemented hereunder. For Categorical Pretreatment Standards that are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, the Town may establish equivalent mass limits only if the User meets all the conditions in 40 CFR 403.6 (c) (5). 
ARTICLE III – PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER 
Section 3.1 Pretreatment Facilities 
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this Ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of this Ordinance within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Director, whichever is more stringent.  All facilities required to achieve and maintain compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director and the NHDES Water Division before such facilities are constructed. Such facilities shall not be connected until said approval is obtained in writing. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user of the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Town under the provisions of this Ordinance.  Plans and specifications for a proposed pretreatment facility shall be the result of the design of a professional engineer licensed by the State of New Hampshire. 
Section 3.2 Additional Pretreatment Measures 
A. 	Whenever deemed necessary, the Director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sanitary sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and impose such other conditions as are deemed necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
B. 	The Director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow.  An IDP may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
C. 	Grease, oil, and/or sand interceptors shall be provided at the owner's expense when, in the opinion of the Director, such devices are necessary for the preliminary treatment of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, oil, and/or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for solely residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Director and shall be so located as to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection by the owner and the Town. All grease and oil traps or interceptors shall be installed outside unless waived by the Director. Maintenance of interceptors requires that the owner be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured materials, in accordance with the requirements established by the Director. The owner shall maintain records of the servicing of grease, oil, and/or sand interceptors. The form and content of such records will be determined by the Director and the records shall be subject to periodic review by the Director. The removal and disposal of captured materials from interceptors shall be performed by a septage or sludge hauler holding a current permit issued by the State of New Hampshire, or by a Hazardous Waste Transporter currently registered with the State of New Hampshire, whichever is applicable. 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

D. 	Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances shall, at the discretion of the Director, install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter and alarm. 
E. 	Where pretreatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, these devices shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
F. 	The owner of any building serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the Director, be required to install a suitable control manhole or approved equivalent structure together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. The owner shall perform such monitoring as the Director may reasonably require including installation, use and maintenance of monitoring equipment, maintaining records and reporting the results of such monitoring to the Town. Such records shall be made available upon request of the Director, and shall be available to other agencies having jurisdiction over discharges to the receiving waters. 
Section 3.3 Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans 
At least once, and as required by changing conditions, the Director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control Slug Discharges. 
Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or their wastes regulated by this Ordinance. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be 
provided and maintained at the user’s own cost and expense. The Director may periodically evaluate 
whether a user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this Ordinance. Alternatively, the Director may develop such a plan for any user.  An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
A. 	A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
B. 	A description of all stored chemicals; 
C. 	Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 6.6 of this Ordinance; 
D. 	Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
Section 3.4 Pollution Prevention Plans 
In accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.8, 6.6, and 10.3 of this Ordinance, the Director may require any person discharging wastes into the POTW to develop and implement, at their own expense, a 

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

pollution prevention plan. The Director may require users to submit as part of the pollution prevention plan information that demonstrates adherence to the following elements: 
A. 	Management Support. For changes to be effective, the visible support of top management is required. Management's support should be explicitly stated and include designation of a pollution prevention coordinator, goals, and time frames for reductions in volume and toxicity of waste streams, and procedures for employee training and involvement. 
B. 	Process Characterization. A detailed process waste diagram shall be developed that identifies and characterizes the input of raw materials, the outflow of products, and the generation of wastes. 
C. 	Waste Assessment. Estimates shall be developed for the amount of wastes generated by each process. This may include establishing and maintaining waste accounting systems to track sources, the rates and dates of generation, and the presence of hazardous constituents. 
D. 	Analysis of Waste Management Economics. Waste management economic returns shall be determined based on the consideration of: 
1. 	
Reduced raw material purchases; 

2. 	
Avoidance of waste treatment, monitoring and disposal costs; 

3. 	
Reductions in operations and maintenance expenses; 

4. 	
Elimination of permitting fees and compliance costs; and 

5. 	
Reduced liabilities for employee/public exposure to hazardous chemicals and cleanup of waste disposal sites. 


E. 	Development of Pollution Prevention Alternatives. Current and past pollution prevention activities shall be assessed, including estimates of the reduction in the amount and toxicity of waste achieved by the identified actions. Opportunities for pollution prevention shall then be assessed for identified processes where raw materials become or generate wastes. Technical information on pollution prevention shall be solicited and exchanged, both from inside the organization and out. 
F. 	Evaluation and Implementation. Technically and economically feasible pollution prevention opportunities shall be identified and an implementation timetable with interim and final milestones shall be developed. The recommendations that are implemented shall be periodically reviewed for effectiveness. 
The review and approval of such pollution prevention plans by the Town shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibilities of modifying their facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Town in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

ARTICLE IV – 	INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMT (IDP) APPLICATION 
Section 4.1 Industrial User Classification System 
The Town maintains an industrial user classification system to allow the Director to group users into categories that define the degree of regulatory attention required. The classification system establishes priorities for allocation of Town resources, and promotes uniformity and fairness in the application of regulations affecting industrial users. A user may be designated at a higher classification level if the Director determines that the user has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting POTW operation, if the user has violated any pretreatment standard or requirement, or at the discretion of the Director.  Every user is assigned to one of three user classes. 
A. 	Class 1: Dischargers of large volumes of industrial wastewater (greater than 10,000 gpd), high loadings (greater than five percent [5%] of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW wastewater treatment facility), and/or chemical constituents warranting a high degree of control and monitoring. Included in this class are all users that are subject to categorical pretreatment standards and users with pretreatment systems that employ automatic controls for sensing, pumping, dosing, and/or other treatment functions occurring without the manual intervention of an operator.  
B. 	Class 2: Discharge between 1,000 and 10,000 gpd of industrial wastewater. Also included are dischargers of greater than 100 gpd with a moderate level of pretreatment (i.e., requires an operator to manually operate equipment, add chemicals, etc.). Dischargers of up to 1,000 gpd of industrial wastewater and restaurants up to 5,000 gpd. Class 2 also includes dischargers with basic pretreatment procedures (e.g., batch pH adjustment, grease, oil, and/or sand interceptors, silver recovery units) and whose industrial wastewater flows do not exceed 100 gpd. 
C. 	Class 3: Dischargers of industrial wastewater that are not otherwise classified and are not required to possess an IDP because: 
• 
Pollutants of concern are not detectible in the user’s effluent; 

• 	
Pollutants of concern are present in only trace amounts and are neither causing nor likely to cause pass-through or interference; 

• 	
Pollutants of concern are present in amounts too small to be effectively reduced by known treatment technologies; or 

• 
The user’s wastestream contains only pollutants compatible with the POTW. 

• 
Non-domestic users that discharge only sanitary sewage to the POTW. 


The following users are considered Class 3 unless their daily industrial flows exceed the values presented in the table: 
USER TYPE  INDUSTRIAL FLOW NOT TO EXCEED (GPD)  
Funeral homes. Boiler blowdown.  100  
Retail food preparation (e.g., bakeries). Beauty salons. Restaurants.  500  
Self-service Laundromats.  1,000

Section 6.11 Sample Collection 
A. 	Except as indicated in paragraph (B), below, the user shall collect wastewater samples using flow-proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow-proportional sampling is not feasible, the Director may authorize the use of time-proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to demonstrate compliance with instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limitations (e.g., screening levels established to protect worker health and safety). A single grab sample may also be used in place of a composite sample with approval of the Director when: 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

1. 	
The effluent is not discharged on a continuous basis (i.e., batch discharges of short duration), and only when the batch exhibits homogeneous characteristics (i.e., completely mixed) and the pollutant can be safely assumed to be uniformly dispersed; 

2. 	
Sampling is at a facility where the Director determines that a statistical relationship can be established between previous grab samples and composite data; and 

3. 	
The waste conditions are relatively constant (i.e., are completely mixed and homogeneous) over the period of the discharge. 


B. 	Samples for temperature, pH, oil & grease, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using proper grab collection techniques in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136. 
C. 	Samples shall only be collected by individuals who are properly qualified, through verifiable training and experience, to perform the type of sampling required. The integrity of all samples shall be ensured by following established chain-of-custody practices for evidentiary samples.  Sampling and chain-of-custody records shall be maintained in accordance with the IDP. Copies of chain-of-custody records shall be submitted as part of each IDP application or report. 
Section 6.12 Timing 
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
Section 6.13 Recordkeeping 
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Ordinance shall create, retain, and make available for inspection and copying, records of all information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities, including documentation associated with Best Management Practices, required by this Ordinance or IDP and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact location, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) obtaining the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.  These records shall remain available for a period of at least five (5) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Town, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director. The Town may require records be submitted upon written request to local or State officials. 
Section 6.14 Program Administration Fee 
Industrial users may be assessed an annual fee by the Town to defray the administrative costs of the industrial pretreatment program as determined by the BOS. 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

ARTICLE VII – POWERS AND AUTHORITIES OF INSPECTORS 
Section 7.1 Compliance Monitoring 
The Town shall investigate instances of noncompliance with the industrial pretreatment standards and requirements. The Town shall, as necessary, sample and analyze the wastewater discharges of contributing users and conduct surveillance and inspection activities to identify, independently of information supplied by such users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with industrial pretreatment standards. Each industrial user may be billed directly for costs incurred for the sampling and analysis of its wastewater. 
Section 7.2 Right of Entry:  Inspection and Sampling 
All industrial users discharging to the Town's POTW shall allow unrestricted access by Town, State and EPA personnel for the purpose of determining whether the user is complying with all requirements of this Ordinance, and any IDP or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Director and other duly authorized representatives of the Town bearing proper identification ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
A. 	Where a user has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make and maintain all necessary arrangements so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
B. 	The Director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
C. 	The Director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations (but at least annually) to ensure their accuracy.  Calibration records shall be maintained. 
D. 	Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
E. 	Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the user's premises, sampling or inspection sites, or pretreatment records shall be a violation of this Ordinance. 
F. 	The Director or other duly authorized employee(s) is authorized to obtain information concerning all industrial processes that have a bearing on the kind or source of discharge to the public sewer.  In accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of this Ordinance, the industrial user may request that the information in question not be disclosed to the public if it can establish that revelation to the public might result in an advantage to competitors. 
G. 	While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in this article, the Director or duly authorized employees of the Town shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the user. The user shall be held harmless for injury or death to the Town employees, and the Town shall indemnify the user against loss or damage to its property by 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

Town employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the user and growing out of the monitoring activities, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the user to maintain safe conditions. 
H. 	The Director and other duly authorized representatives of the Town bearing proper identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the Town holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the POTW lying within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved. 
Section 7.3 Search Warrants 
If the Director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Town designed to verify compliance with this Ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Director may obtain an administrative inspection warrant under RSA 595-B. 
ARTICLE VIII – CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION / PUBLIC PARTICIPATION 
Information and data about a user obtained from reports, surveys, IDP Applications, IDPs, monitoring programs, and from the Director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submittal of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Ordinance, the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the 
person providing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as 
defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
ARTICLE IX – PUBLICATION OF POLLUTION PREVENTION ACHIEVEMENTS 
The Director may publish annually, in the daily newspaper having the largest circulation in the Town, a list of users whom during the previous twelve (12) months, demonstrated a commitment to reducing the volume and toxicity of waste discharges. All pollution prevention efforts, not just those that affect wastewater discharges, may be subject to recognition. The following criteria may be used to identify published users: 
A. 	Innovative ideas the facility has used to implement process changes that eliminate or reduce the volume or toxicity of waste generated; 
B. 	The percentage of the facility's process water reused within the system or process; 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

C. 	The percentage of the facility's potential waste reused within the system or process; 
D. 	Implementation of employee pollution prevention training and communication programs; 
E. 	Voluntary performance of pollution prevention audits; 
F. 	Spill control procedures/devices (e.g., secondary containment) the facility initiates to prevent accidental chemical spills from entering the POTW; and 
G. 	The environmental and/or economic benefits or successes derived from implementing pollution prevention methods. 
The intent of the publication is to notify local consumers of the environmental responsiveness of local businesses, and to encourage industrial users to identify and implement opportunities for preventing pollution. As part of this publication, the Town may provide an evaluation of the impact of these changes to the POTW, and summarize the current status of pollutant loadings to the POTW and goals established by the POTW for pollution prevention efforts. 
ARTICLE X – ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES 
Section 10.1 Notification of Violation 
When the Director determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within the time period specified in the violation notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Director. Submittal of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this article shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
Section 10.2 Compliance Schedule Development 
The Director may require any user that has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to develop a compliance schedule. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in Section 6.2 of this Ordinance. 
Section 10.3 Pollution Prevention Plan Development 
The Director may require any user that has violated or continues to violate any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to develop a pollution prevention plan in accordance with Section 3.4 of this Ordinance. The pollution prevention plan must specifically address violation(s) for which this action was undertaken. The pollution prevention plan shall be developed using good engineering judgment and shall be submitted to the Director no later than sixty (60) days after the user was notified of this requirement. 
Section 10.4 Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

The Director will publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of the users that, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
Section 10.5 Show Cause Orders 
The Town Manager upon recommendation by the Director may order a user that has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, executing any other action against the user. 
Section 10.6 Cease and Desist Orders 
When the Town Manager, upon advice from the Director, determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Town Manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
A. 	Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
B. 	Implement such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
Section 10.7 Consent Orders 
The Town Manager is hereby empowered to enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the order. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment systems, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. Such orders shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 10.5 and 10.6 of this Ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable. 
Section 10.8 IDP Termination 
The Town Manager may terminate a user’s IDP for good cause, including but not limited to the following: 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

A. 	Violation of IDP conditions; 
B. 	Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
C. 	Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;

M. 	Discharging wastewater that presents an imminent hazard to the public health, safety or welfare, or to the local environment; or 
N. 	Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or this Ordinance or order issued hereunder, or any applicable State or Federal law. 
Section 10.9 Termination of Discharge 
In addition to the provisions in Section 10.8 of this Ordinance, any user who violates a Section 10.8 cause, or fails to cease and desist from any discharge of wastewater upon termination of their IDP for that discharge, is subject to discharge termination.  
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 10.5 of this Ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
Section 10.10 Emergency Suspensions 
The Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, subsequent to informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to terminate an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of POTW 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

personnel or the public. The Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or that presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
A. 	Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately terminate or eliminate its wastewater discharge. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may implement such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection and entry on private property to halt such discharge, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 10.9 of this Ordinance are initiated against the user. 
B. 	A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures implemented to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 10.5 or 10.9 of this Ordinance. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
Section 10.11 Recovery of Expenses 
Any person violating any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall become liable to the Town for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned by the Town by reason of such violation. If the Town Manager or Board of Selectmen implemented the disconnection of a building sewer from a public sewer, the Town may collect the expenses associated with completing the disconnection from any person responsible for, or willfully concerned in, or who profited by such violation. The Town may thereafter refuse to permit the restoration of the former connection or of any new connection to the property concerned in the violation until the claim of the Town for the cost of completing such disconnection shall have been paid in full plus interest and the reasonable cost of any legal expenses incurred by the Town in connection therewith. 
Section 10.12 Harm to Town Property 
No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently damage, discharge prohibited pollutants to any sewer, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment that is part of the POTW. Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under a charge of disorderly conduct pursuant to the local Ordinances and State and federal statutes. 
Section 10.13 Injunctive Relief 
When the Town Manager determines that any person or user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Town Manager may petition the Jaffrey/Peterborough District Court through the Town's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the IDP, order, or other requirement imposed by this Ordinance on activities of the user. The Director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, implementing any other action against a user. 
Section 10.14 Civil Penalties 
A. 	A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Town for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation, per day, plus actual damages incurred by the POTW. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
B. 	The Town Manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Town. The Town Manager shall petition the Court to impose, assess, and recover such sums. 
C. 	In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions implemented by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
D. 	Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, implementing any other action against a user. 
Section 10.15 Criminal Prosecution 
Any person who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a violation, punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000 for each violation. Every separate provision violated shall constitute a separate violation. Every day that a violation occurs shall be deemed a separate violation.  Ref. RSA 47:17 (suppl.), RSA 149-I:6, or revisions thereto, and RSA 31:39 (suppl.). 
Section 10.16 Nonexclusive Remedies 
The remedies provided for in this Ordinance are not exclusive. The Town may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. The Town may pursue other action against any user without limitation, including ex parte temporary judicial relief to prevent a violation of this Ordinance. Further, the Town is empowered to pursue more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

ARTICLE XI – AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 
Section 11.1 Upset 
A. 	For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards due to factors beyond the reasonable control of the user.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
B. 	An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met. 
C. 	A user who intends to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
1. 	
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 

2. 	
At the time of the upset, the facility was being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 

3. 	
The user has submitted the following information to the Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submittal must be provided within five (5) days): 

a. 	
A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 

b. 	
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 

c. 	
Action being implemented and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 




D. 	In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
E. 	Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
F. 	A user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

Section 11.2 Prohibited Discharge Standards 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in paragraph 2.6(A) of this Ordinance or the specific prohibitions in paragraph 2.6(B) of this Ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
A. 	A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
B. 	No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements. 
Section 11.3 Bypass 
A. 	For the purposes of this section, 
1. 	
“Bypass” means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 

2. 	
“Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 


B. 	A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section. 
C. 	The user shall provide the following notifications for bypass events: 
1. 	
If a user is aware in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall submit prior notice to the Director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 

2. 	
A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submittal shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submittal shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps implemented or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 


D. 	Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may initiate enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

1. 	
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 

2. 	
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 

3. 	
The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section. 


E. 	The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, subsequent to considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will satisfy the three conditions listed in paragraph (D) of this section. 
ARTICLE XII – SEPTAGE DISPOSAL 
RSA 485-A, or revisions thereto, of the State rules, regulations, standards, and procedures promulgated thereupon require that "any person, firm, corporation, municipal subdivision or institution who removes, transports, or disposes, or intends to remove, transport or dispose of any human excrement or other putrescible material by portable or mobile container shall hold an unrevoked permit for that purpose from the NHDES."

The capacity of the tank; 

3. 	
The NHDES Permit Number; and 

4. 	
Any other details of compliance with the regulations of the NHDES. 


C. 	The following conditions shall constitute conditions precedent to the issuance of each permit by the Town: 
1. 	
Each septic tank truck shall have installed thereon, a sight level by which the quantity of the contents of each tank may be ascertained by visual observation; or 

2. 	
Each septic tank truck shall have an access port in which the quantity of the contents of each truck may be ascertained by depth measurements. 

3. 	
Before the time of disposal, the hauler shall enter the following information into a manifest form located at the wastewater treatment facility: 

a. 
The hauler's name; 

b. 
Date; 

c. 
Time of disposal; 

d. 
Volume disposed; 

e. 
Origin of load (property owner's name, address, and telephone number); and 

f. 
Nature of the waste (i.e., septage) being disposed. 



4. 	
Owners of "RVs" who intend to discharge the contents of holding tanks are exempt from the permitting process. 


JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

Section 12.4 Septage Disposal Charge 
There shall be a Septage Disposal Charge as established by a Schedule of Fees as approved by the Board of Selectmen, as the Town may adopt from time to time, for the receipt of septage into the Town's wastewater treatment facility for treatment. In the event that the permittee has either a defective sight level, no sight level attached to the truck, and/or no access to the contents of the truck for depth measurement, the permittee shall be charged according to the full tank capacity at the time of discharge or by other method determined by the Director.

JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

Appendix I Maximum Allowable Industrial Mass Loading Limitations 
The Director will not issue permits that in combination with other industrial loads exceed the values in the table located in Appendix I of this Ordinance: 
POLLUTANT  MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE INDUSTRIAL LOADING (lbs/day)  POLLUTANT  MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE INDUSTRIAL LOADING (lbs/day)  
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)  495  Total Suspended Solids (TSS)  578  
Aluminum  7.208  Mercury  0.002  
Arsenic  0.000*  Molybdenum  0.008  
Cadmium  0.004  Nickel  0.107  
Chromium  0.304  Selenium  0.013  
Copper  0.274  Silver  0.013  
Cyanide (T)  0.036  Zinc  0.498  
Lead  0.027  - - 

* No discharge greater than background concentration will be permitted. 
All mass loading limitations for metals represent total metals, regardless of the valance state, or the physical or chemical form of the metal. To administer these allowable loadings through IDPs, the Director will impose concentration-based limitations, or mass limitations, or both, on a case-by-case basis into site-specific IDPs. For industrial users, the values written into IDPs for the above pollutants shall apply at the end of the industrial wastestream and prior to dilution with non-industrial wastewaters. 
Unless specifically identified in an IDP, an industrial user is not allowed to discharge the locally limited pollutants at concentrations significantly greater than background concentrations. For the purposes of this requirement, significant means 67.9 percent (67.9%) greater than the background concentrations used for local limits development.  
Daily concentration (or mass loading) is the concentration (or mass) of a pollutant discharged, determined from the analysis of a flow-composite sample (or other sampling procedure approved by the Director) representative of the discharge over the duration of a 24-hour day or industrial operating schedule of less than twenty-four (24) hours. 
JAFFREY MUNICIPAL SEWER USE ORDINANCE 

Appendix II 
Screening Levels. 
Screening levels are numerical values above which actions are initiated to evaluate, prevent, or reduce adverse impacts on the POTW, the environment, and/or human health and safety. The Town monitors industrial sources of conservative pollutant-bearing discharges in comparison to established uniform concentration values, and authorization to discharge at greater concentrations may be granted subject to the administrative procedures for managing mass loading limitations. Uniform concentration values for conservative pollutants will be maintained by the Town, independent of this Ordinance, to provide regulatory flexibility. 
Screening levels for non-conservative pollutants are concentration-based values that, if exceeded, represent a potential to compromise worker safety, create flammability or chemical reactivity conditions in the collection system, or result in operational issues such as excessive organic/solids loadings. Screening levels for non-conservative pollutants are developed as needed using the methodology of the Town’s local limits study. The data in the table located in Appendix II of this Ordinance are representative of non-conservative pollutants and the concentrations above which they shall not be discharged to the POTW without approval of the Director.

If any of the screening levels are exceeded, repeat analysis may be required by the Town to verify compliance or noncompliance with that screening level. If noncompliance is indicated, then the industrial user may be required, at the discretion of the Director, to conduct an 
appropriate engineering evaluation at the industrial user’s expense to determine the potential 
impact of the discharge of this pollutant to the Town's POTW or alternatively, to develop a pollution prevention plan specifically addressing the pollutant that exceeds the screening level.  This study or plan shall be approved by and conducted under the supervision of the Town.  Should the evaluation indicate the impact to be unsatisfactory, the industrial user shall reduce the pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level. If the evaluation supports development of an alternate site-specific limitation, then the screening level may, at the discretion of the Director, be adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user and administered as a permit limitation for the specific discharge. 
If an industrial user proposes to discharge at concentrations greater than the concentration-based screening level maintained by the Town, then the industrial user may be required to conduct the evaluations described in the previous paragraph. Should the evaluations support an alternate site-specific limitation, then the screening level may, at the discretion of the Director, be adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user and administered as a permit limitation for the specific discharge.

Winter Maintenance Policy 

(Includes Highway, Sidewalks, Transfer Station and Parking Areas) 
§ 171-4  Equipment. 
The Highway Department utilizes all the assets needed to address snow emergencies. A list of the current rolling stock assets is maintained by the Town Mechanic.

§ 171-5              STREETS AND SIDEWALKS           § 171-7 
§ 171-5  Routes 
Currently, the town is divided into eleven (11) plow routes and four (4) treatment routes.  Major through-roads and school bus routes are prioritized as much as possible noting that major arterials (Routes 202, 124, 137) are maintained by the NHDOT. 
§ 171-6  Manpower 
Full-time Public Works employees, including Water Division employees assist the Highway Department with winter road maintenance.  In addition, several contractors, as deemed necessary by the Director or designee are contracted with seasonally to assist. This includes the contract operator of the wastewater treatment facility. 
§ 171-7  Materials 
The department anticipates using approximately 2000 tons of salt and 750-900 cubic yards of sand each season.  Salt is typically obtained from supplier utilizing the NHDOT bid pricing annual contract.  Locally procured sand is used as an abrasive for dirt roads and is applied to improve the public’s motor vehicle traction.  On paved roads salt is deposited by mechanical spreader in the middle of the road (where traffic allows) creating a liquid super salt (brine) effect.  Depending upon the type of treatment required for road conditions, the salt may be broadcast over the travel way to deice.   Department may also employ additional anti-icing compounds such as calcium chloride. 
At the beginning of each winter season, it is the goal of the department to begin the season with a full salt shed.  As material is used, salt is ordered to keep the shed stocked. 
Unless weather conditions require a different approach, winter maintenance routes are usually treated first with salt. If a mixture of sand and salt is used the ratio used is approximately 2 parts sand to 1 salt.  The salt is applied as close to the center of the roadway as possible, where traffic can work the mix traveling either way (this sometimes requires spreading the material). The mixture, in conjunction with traffic action, creates a watery brine melting snow and / or ice, and resists snow and ice packing on the roadway. The road crown further assists with the spreading of the mixture brine. Depending on temperatures and other weather conditions, the Public Works Director or his designee will make the determination as to when to stop applying salt and change to other add materials that are available for use at the time. 
The following roads (or sections thereof) are designated “No or Reduced Salt Zones” and may be treated with salt alternatives: 
o Gilmore Pond Road 

o Squantum Road 


Gravel roads receive no anti-icing materials. Sand is spread on these roads as an abrasive.

§ 171-8                                          STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 171-11 
§171-8 Communications 
The Public Works rolling stock is equipped with two-way radios capable of transmitting and receiving on a town owned frequency. Most private contractors working for the town communicate with DPW using cell phones. Department radios also have the ability to monitor police and fire channels to address concerns of those departments. 
§171-9  Schools 
Public Works is not responsible for maintenance activities at the Jaffrey-Rindge schools. 
The school superintendent or designated official representative may contact the Public Works Department to determine the condition of the municipality’s roads. The school representative shall make the decision to cancel or postpone school for that day. 
§171-10  Parking 
The Town enacts a winter parking ban effective from November 1st to April 15th annually. This ban prohibits parking in or on the town’s roads or right-of-ways between 11:00 PM and 6:00 AM. The Town has the right to tow at the owner’s expense. The purpose of the winter parking ban is to allow winter maintenance crews unobstructed snow removal and ice control routes, as much as possible, and to maintain the maximum effectiveness of their efforts.  Overnight parking is also restricted in Blake Street parking lot and the Town Office parking lot. Overnight parking is permitted in the Blake Street lot in designated areas only. Violators may be ticked and/or towed. 
§171-11  Snow & Ice Operations 
At the commencement of inclement weather, based upon reported and observed road conditions and traffic, salting of roadways commences.  Dependent upon intensity of precipitation, salting operations may be halted or skipped and plowing commencing immediately.  Once plowing of public roadways, sidewalks and parking lots begins, it will continue until precipitation has ceased and all roads are clear.  Once plowing ceases, based on road conditions, salt or other materials may be spread.  For gravel roads, application of sand is done typically upon completion of application of anti-icing materials on paved roadways and/or availability of equipment.  
§171-12 Plow Route Priorities 
With a total of over 64 miles of town roads from which to remove snow and ice and finite pieces of equipment to handle these responsibilities, the Highway Department has to assign priorities for winter maintenance route activity in order to maximize the effectiveness of their efforts for the motoring public. 
17104 

§ 171-12	                                          STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 171-14 
§171-12 Plow Route Priorities (continued) 
o 	Main roadways will be given first priority.  Efforts will be made that school bus routes will be given the first priority during school days. 

o 	Sidewalks will receive winter maintenance concurrent with maintenance of roadways subject to limitations of manpower, equipment and size of storm. 

o 	Public parking areas at the Town Office, Library, Police Station, and Fire Station will be maintained by plowing during the winter storm.   The application of slip resistant materials will be applied as determined by the Highway Foreman or his designee. 

o 	Transfer Station / Recycling Center: If the facility is open during the snow or ice storm, personnel or contractor will plow this area prior to opening for public use. Public areas shall be kept as clear as possible to provide as safe access as is reasonably possible. 

o 	Sand and other slip resistant materials to be used in public areas. It often will not be possible to maintain clear ground, but a reasonable effort will be made during storms. 


§171-13  Roads not receiving Winter Maintenance 
The town of Jaffrey does not maintain a number of roadways as part of its ongoing winter maintenance activities. The areas not maintained by the Town includes: 
o 	Town roads classified as Class VI roads. 

o 	Private roads 

o 	Private subdivision roads 

o 	Class V roads closed for winter (Witt Hill Road Section) 


§171-14  Damage to Private Property 
It should be noted that the municipality isn’t held responsible for damage to private property that is located within the public right of way. The right of way (ROW) often varies but can be up to 50’ wide, and is often confused by property owners as their own property. In most cases, the ROW extends ten to twenty feet on either side of the paved or gravel road. Homeowners cultivate extensions of their lawns, place mailboxes, erect fences or stonewall in these areas, which improves the appearance of the street greatly, but is obstructive to good maintenance from being conducted on the roadway. 
Homeowners should not put bark mulch, crushed rock, stone walls, fences (visible and invisible), irrigation systems, trees or lawns in the town right-of-way. The town is not liable for damage that may occur to property in its right-of-way. Many items interfere with heavy equipment and become a hazard for vehicles and pedestrians. They often cause drainage failures, and thereby road deterioration. 
Location of Mailboxes: Mail and newspaper boxes are allowed, at the owner’s risk within the right-of-way for purposes of convenience. United States Postal Bulletin 22102 states: 
“The Postal Service suggests using a semi-arch or extended arm support which allows snowplows to sweep near or under mailboxes without damaging supports and provides easy access to the mailboxes by carriers and customers.” 
17105 

§ 171-14	                                          STREETS AND SIDEWALKS              § 171-16 
§171-14  Damage to Private Property (continued) 
The following suggestions for reducing the possibility of damage and liability: 
• 	
Mailboxes should be installed at least three feet from the edge of pavement 

• 	
Installations should be sufficiently sturdy to withstand the weight of heavy snow resulting from plowing operations. 


§171-15  Post Storm Operations 
Snow bank removal operations will occur in the downtown business parking area at a time determined by the Director or his designee.  The Department will strive to remove the snow as soon as practical, but limitations such as manpower, equipment, fatigue, traffic, and forecasted weather will factor into the decision on when snow is to be removed.  The department will endeavor to complete this task in the overnight to minimize impacts to vehicular traffic and pedestrians and disruptions to businesses. 
As determined by the Director of Public Works or his designee, the snow banks resulting from the previous accumulations may be pushed back, or shelved, using the plow and wings of the dump trucks, grader, or other suitable equipment to make space for future snow storms. 
Roads will be scraped in those areas subject to drifting snow, on an as needed basis. 
§171-16  Sidewalk Snow Removal 
Sidewalks are constructed at the outer edge of the right-of-way creating a conflict between snow removal equipment and some structures such as fences. Every effort is made to minimize damage to private property. Should damage occur, after inspection, public works personnel will negotiate extent of repairs. 
Sidewalk snow removal will be done as soon as possible within the limitations of manpower, equipment, and storm size. If there are insufficient personnel available to conduct sidewalk snow removal operations, as well as street and road clearance, the streets and roads shall take priority. The sidewalks will be treated with ice control materials as quickly as possible after the storm if required. 
Total operations for a moderate sized snowfall will typically require 3-4 days from beginning to end.

INDEX 

INDEX INSTRUCTIONS 
The main INDEX, beginning on page 1, will guide you to the legislation contained within the Code at the time the main INDEX was originally prepared.  As new legislation is adopted, or existing legislation is amended, the Code pages are replaced by supplementary pages which include the new material, thereby causing some INDEX entries to become obsolete. INDEX entries to the new material will be provided for in the SUPPLEMENTAL INDEX, beginning on page SI-1. 
The SUPPLEMENTAL INDEX should, therefore, be consulted first, since it refers to the more recent legislation.  Then reference should be made to the main INDEX. 
When received, SUPPLEMENTAL INDEX pages should be placed directly following this page and in front of the main INDEX, according to the instructions accompanying the supplement. 
Numbers in the indices refer to section numbers in the Code, e.g., 39-3 is a reference to Chapter 39, Section 3.

May 9, 2017 23 Areas and Setbacks 
6.1 Dimensional Table (con’t) 
Explanatory notes: 
a) 	The lot sizes and dimensions in the Mountain, Rural, Residence A, and Residence B districts are intended for one and only one principal structure per lot unless specifically otherwise provided for elsewhere in this ordinance. 
b) 	“Frontage” means the horizontal distance measured along a lot line dividing a lot from a street that meets the minimum requirements of Appendix A, Section III, to the Jaffrey Rules and Regulations to Control Subdivisions. Driveways to interior lots shall not be construed as frontage for the front lot. 
c) 	“Setback” means the horizontal distance between a lot line and the nearest part of a structure. 
6.1.1 	During the Site Plan Review process, the Planning Board may waive up to 25% of the parking requirements, if deemed appropriate. 
6.2 	No lot on which a building is located in any district shall be reduced or changed in size or shape so that the building or lot fails to comply with the lot area, frontage, setback, yard or height provisions of this ordinance that are applicable to the construction or placement of the building on the lot unless a variance is obtained from the Zoning Board of Adjustment.  This provision shall not apply, however, when a portion of the lot is taken for public purposes. (Amended March 2009) 
6.3 	Minimum lot sizes for apartment houses except in the General Business District where Section VI shall control, whether units are single, cooperative, or condominium ownerships: 
One acre for the first living unit in a building, plus one-half acre for the second living unit in a building, plus an additional five thousand (5,000) square feet for each additional living unit in a building. 
There shall be a maximum of eight (8) living units in a building, except in the rural districts where the maximum number of units shall be limited to four (4) per building. 
6.4 	The lot size for two-family dwellings shall be twice that for single-family dwellings in the same district. 
6.5 	Lot sizes for Open Space Development Plan are discussed in Section XIII. (Amended March 2000, 2005, 2008) 
6.6 	In cases where sale and/or resale are not involved, in-ground fuel tanks are exempted from the setback requirements of this section upon certification by the Jaffrey Fire Chief that such placement is not hazardous. 
6.7 	Unenclosed porches and decks may encroach upon setback areas by Special Exception of the Board of Adjustment, subject to the following conditions: 
6.7.1 The dwelling was a lawfully existing use at the time of the adoption of this ordinance. 
6.7.2 	The building line of the addition does not extend more than ten (10) feet into the setback area. 
6.8 	Improvements necessitated by the Americans with Disabilities Act are expressly exempted from setback requirements; permit fees for ramps or other handicap accesses may be waived, as determined by the Selectmen.  (Amended 1993) 
6.9 	A buffer area shall be required in all districts when any new commercial or industrial use is established adjacent to an existing residential use.  The buffer shall comprise 50% of the required setback for the zoning district, as measured inward from the property line, and shall be of a type deemed appropriate for the location by the Planning Board during Site Plan Review. 
6.10 	Interior Lots — An interior lot presents a special case whereby a single-family residential construction is permitted under a special set of circumstances on a parcel of land that does not have the frontage normally required in the Rural District.  An interior lot must, however, have a minimum access of fifty (50) feet in width to an approved street by ownership of land. (Amended 2003) 
6.10.1 	The interior lot must contain a minimum of twelve (12) acres, and the front lot must contain at least the standard acreage required in the Rural District, exclusive of any deeded ROW. 
6.10.2 	All setbacks specified in section VI must be met for residential construction.  For purposes of this section, the front setback of an interior lot shall mean the distance from the line separating the interior lot (exclusive of owned or ROW access to an approved street) from the front lot.  A structure built on an interior lot may not be closer than three hundred (300) feet from an approved street. 
6.10.3 	Because of the special nature of an interior lot, only one interior lot per driveway is permitted, and an interior lot may be used only for one single-family residence and/or agricultural or silvicultural purposes. 
6.10.4 	Once established, an interior lot may not be further subdivided. 
6.11 	Within the “Main Street” Program Area: Commercial establishments must demonstrate adequate and appropriate parking capability for employees and customers. In this context, a reasonable portion (not dedicated) of municipal parking may be considered. Residential units must have dedicated parking, with one space required for a one-bedroom unit and two spaces for all others. Where possible, the parking area should be at the rear of the lot. (Amended 2002) 
SECTION VII:  NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS

7.1 	Nonconforming Uses 
7.1.1 	A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use.  If a nonconforming use is superseded by a conforming use, the nonconforming use may not thereafter be assumed. 
7.1.2 	A nonconforming use may not be substantially expanded or enlarged; natural, but limited, expansion may be allowed, provided it does not have a substantially different impact upon the neighborhood.

7.2.2 	The relocation on a lot of a structure that does not comply with the setback provisions is allowed provided the new location complies with the setback provisions. 
7.2.3 	A nonconforming structure may be expanded provided that the expansion does not encroach any more into the nonconforming direction than the existing structure.  Expansion in a conforming direction is permitted. 
7.3 	Nonconforming Lots of Record 
In any district, a vacant lot that was a lawful lot of record as of the effective date of this ordinance may be developed for the uses permitted in that district, even though the lot does not conform to the area or frontage requirements of this ordinance. The applicable district requirements for yard setbacks and state septic system requirements shall still apply. 
SECTION VIII:  ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES 
8.1 	The Board of Selectmen is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt such rules or organization and procedure as are necessary for the efficient administration and enforcement of this ordinance. 
8.2 	Upon any well-founded information that this ordinance is being violated, the Selectmen shall, on their own initiative, take immediate steps to enforce the provisions of this ordinance by seeking an injunction in the Superior Court or by any other appropriate legal action. 
8.3 	Infractions are punishable in accordance with the provision of RSA 676:15-17. 
SECTION IX:  APPEALS 
Per RSA 676:5, Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected by an administrative decision or action taken by the code officer enforcing this zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to RSA 674:16.    
SECTION X:  GUIDELINES FOR THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 
10.1 	General - The distinction between a Special Exception and a Variance. 
A special exception can be defined as a stated exception to the ordinance if certain terms and conditions are met, while a variance is a provision for non-enforcement of the ordinance as it may apply under special circumstances to a particular piece of land, which special circumstances have not been specifically provided for in the wording of the ordinance. 
10.2 	Unless otherwise specifically provided, the Board of Adjustment shall, before granting a Special Exception (RSA 674:33), find that, in their judgment, all of the following conditions are met: 
10.2.1  The specific site is an appropriate location for such a use, structure, or condition;  
10.2.2  The use, structure, or activity will not be detrimental to the neighborhood nor significantly alter the characteristics of the district;  
10.2.3  Adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for the proper operation of the proposed use; and  
10.2.4  Such exception, if granted, will not adversely affect any other district or portion thereof.  
10.2.5  Special Exceptions authorized by the Board of Adjustment shall be valid if exercised within 2 years from the date of final approval, or as further extended by the Board for good cause, provided that no such special exception shall expire within 6 months after the resolution of a planning application filed in reliance upon the special exception  

(2016). 
10.3 	The power to grant variances stems from RSA 674:33.  All of the following conditions must be found by the Board of Adjustment before they can grant a variance. (Amended 2005, 2017) 
10.3.1 	The variance will not be contrary to the public interest. 
10.3.2 	The variance is consistent with the spirit of the ordinance. 
10.3.3 	Substantial justice is done. 
10.3.4 	The value of surrounding properties will not be diminished; and 
10.3.5 	Literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. 
a) 	For purposes of this subparagraph, “unnecessary hardship” means that, owing to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other properties in the area: 
(i) 	
No fair and substantial relationship exists between the general public purposes of the ordinance provision and the specific application of that provision to the property; and 

(ii) 	
The proposed use is a reasonable one 


b) 	If the criteria in subparagraph a) are not established, an unnecessary hardship will be deemed to exist if, and only if, owing to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other properties in the area, the property cannot be reasonably used in strict conformance with the ordinance, and a variance is therefore necessary to enable a reasonable use of it. 
The definition of “unnecessary hardship” set forth in paragraph 10.3.5 shall apply whether the provision of the ordinance from which a variance is sought is a restriction on use, a dimensional or other limitation on a permitted use, or any other requirement of the ordinance (2017). 
10.3.6 	Variances authorized by the Board of Adjustment shall be valid if exercised within 2 years from the date of final approval, or as further extended by the Board for good cause, provided that no such variance shall expire within 6 months after the resolution of a planning application filed in reliance upon the special exception (2017). 
SECTION XI:  AMENDMENT 
11.1 	Ordinances embodied in the Jaffrey Land Use Code may be amended by a majority vote at Town Meeting when such amendment is published in the warrant calling for the meeting and when such amendment has received a public hearing, which hearing has been advertised and given legal ten-day (10) notice, all in accordance with RSA 675:3 and 4. 
SECTION XII: GUIDE TO ZONING DISTRICT[S] IN THE TOWN OF JAFFREY 
(Description) 
12.1 	General 
Districts are designated by name for ease in identification.  The following shall pertain in 
determining district boundaries: 
12.1.1 	Points of road intersection shall be measured from the center line of the traveled way unless otherwise specified (e.g., 500' south of Route 124 means 500' south of the center line of Route 124). 
12.1.2 	When the edge of a road is specified, it means the edge of the legal road property or right-of-way. 
12.1.3 	When the shoreline of a body of water is specified, it means the shoreline at the normal high water mark. 
12.1.4 	Distances are to be read as stated, not as rounded-off approximations. 
12.1.5 	In cases of a conflict of district lines, the more restrictive district requirements should prevail. 
12.1.6 	In the event of a discrepancy between the narrative description of zoning districts (in the Jaffrey Zoning Ordinance) and the boundaries as shown on the zoning map of Jaffrey as prepared by Cartographic Associates, Inc., the narrative description will take precedence.

SECTION XIII: INNOVATIVE LAND USE PLAN (Amended March 2002, March 2003, March 2008) General: Pursuant to 674:21 the Planning Board will administer Innovative Land Use controls including 
Open Space Development and Village Plan Alternative. 
13.1 Definition An Open Space Development Plan (OSDP) or Village Plan Alternative (VPA) as defined in RSA 674.21 
VI. is a form of residential subdivision whereby a developer may be permitted an increase in development density above traditional zoning densities and added flexibility in lot size, frontage, and setbacks provided that (1) common open land is permanently preserved, (2) viewsheds, watersheds, and other natural resources are protected, including shoreline protection overlay and wetlands conservation districts, (3) the development meets Planning Board criteria for approval (see PB criteria under provisions), and (4) goals of the Master Plan are met. 
13.2 Purpose An OSDP or VPA has several advantages to the Town of Jaffrey and reflects the goals of the Master Plan. An OSDP or VPA (1) provides a means of preserving open space for conservation, agriculture, recreation, etc., (2) preserves and enhances the rural character of neighborhoods, and the town as a whole, by protecting natural features and viewsheds, (3) protects natural resources including wildlife corridors, (4) reduces the number of roadside curb-cuts and reduces the spread of “cookie cutter” development along public roadways, and (5) promotes the more sensitive siting of buildings and better overall site planning. 
There are several advantages to an OSDP or VPA from the standpoint of the developer. Subject to the provisions noted below, an OSDP or VPA may provide a development density incentive for a developer. To a developer, an OSDP or VPA also (1) permits economies in road construction, road maintenance, public utilities and public service, (2) provides flexibility in creating housing in pleasant, natural surroundings, presumably increasing property marketability, (3) creates ability to place open space into conservation easement, and (4) permits flexibility of building requirements such as lot sizes, frontages and setbacks. 
13.3 Definitions 
As used in this section, the following definitions apply: 
13.3.1  “Open Space Land” means any and all farm land, forest land, or unproductive  
land intended for preservation in perpetuity.  
13.3.2  “Farm Land” shall be a tract or tracts of undeveloped land devoted to, or  
capable of the production of agricultural or horticultural crops. Land containing  
roads constructed solely in support of agricultural or horticultural activities  
shall be included in farm land.  
13.3.3  “Forest Land” shall be a tract of undeveloped land actively devoted to, or  
capable of, growing trees. Land containing roads constructed solely in support  
of forest purposes shall be included in forest land. Forest land that has been  
subjected to clear cutting shall still qualify as forest land.  
13.3.4  “Unproductive land” shall be one of the following: (1) a tract of unimproved  
land that has no structures, does not produce agricultural or forest crops, and is  
being left in its natural state without interference with the natural ecological  
process: or (2) a tract of unimproved wetland that is incapable of producing  
agricultural or forest crops; and by reason of wetness is being left in its natural  
state.  
13.3.5  “Usable land” shall be the total area of the lot less (1) all land with slopes  
greater than 25%, (2) all wetlands as defined in Section XX of the Wetlands  
Conservation District Ordinance.

16.1 Purpose and Intent.  
The purpose of the sign ordinance is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the townspeople and visitors, and to improve the appearance of the town while recognizing the economic importance of signs to our business community.  This ordinance is also intended to recognize that signs are a unique and important medium for sharing political, religious, or personal messages within the community.  The display of signs should be in keeping with the community goals set forth in the Jaffrey Master Plan and any other documents adopted by reference therein.  It is further the intent of this section that signs should not destroy or detract from the scenic vistas or buildings and surroundings of historical or cultural importance, compete unnecessarily with the natural environment, or proliferate in an unrestricted manner.  This ordinance encourages the use of graphics and materials that are architecturally appropriate and compatible with community character, readable and clear, non-distracting to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and are maintained in good repair. 
16.2 Content.  
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section, no sign shall be subject to any limitation based on the content of the message contained on any such sign. (Amended 2017). 
16.2 Districts. 
Recognizing that the downtown district of Jaffrey reflects a diverse business climate that must accommodate for close proximity of vehicular, pedestrian, and multi-directional activity, this ordinance establishes the following districts for the purpose of permitting signs: The Downtown District (as described and bounded below) and all other zoning districts as described in Section XII of the Jaffrey Zoning Ordinance. 
Downtown District.

SECTION XVII: IMPACT FEE ORDINANCE 
17.1 Authority 
This ordinance is established pursuant to New Hampshire RSA 674:21 as an innovative land use control. Under this authority, new development in the Town of Jaffrey may be assessed impact fees in proportion to its demand on the public capital facilities of the Town and the School District. 
The Planning Board is hereby authorized to assess impact fees upon new development, as herein defined, and in accordance with the standards herein set forth.   The Planning Board shall have the authority to adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this Ordinance and to delegate the administrative functions of impact fee assessment, collection and disbursement.

17.3.3 	Development enabled through this zoning ordinance will create a need for the construction, equipping or expanding of public capital facilities. 
17.3.4 	The imposition of impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of public capital facilities necessary to accommodate such development. 
17.3.5 	The fees established by the Impact Fee Schedules for the categories identified in section 17.7 are derived from, based upon, and do not exceed the costs of: 
a) Providing additional public capital facilities necessitated by new development or

20.13 Definitions 
Terms not defined herein shall have the customary dictionary meaning.  As used in this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
ACCESORY BUILDING - A subordinate building located on the same lot with the main building and the use of which is customarily incidental to the main building.  This building shall be a single-story building with dimensions not exceeding two hundred (200) square feet and may be located as close as thirty (30) feet to the normal high water mark. 
BASAL AREA - The cross sectional area of a tree measured at a height of four and one 
half feet above the ground (usually expressed in square feet per acre for a stand of trees). 
EPHEMERAL PONDS - Topographic depressions that flood seasonally at a time of high 
water table. 
INCORRECT DESIGNATION OF SOILS -In the event that an area is incorrectly designated as having poorly drained or very poorly drained soils on the Town of Jaffrey "Wet Soils and Wetlands Map" and evidence to that effect is satisfactorily presented to the Planning Board, the restrictions contained in this regulation shall not apply.  Such evidence may be obtained by adequate onsite soils investigation and analysis conducted by a soils scientist qualified in field analysis. 
INTERMITTENT STREAM - A drainage channel with running water only during times of high water table or high runoff volume due to snowmelt or rainstorms; typically seasonal flow, as with spring snowmelt. 
NORMAL HIGH WATER MARK - That line on the shores and banks of nontidal waters that is apparent because of the contiguous, different character of the soil or the vegetation due to the prolonged action of the water.  Relative to vegetation, it is that line where the vegetation changes from predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial (i.e., aquatic vegetation includes but is not limited to the following plants and plant groups:  water lily, pond lily, pickerelweed, cattail, wild rice, sedges, rushes, and marsh grasses; and terrestrial vegetation includes but is not limited to the following plants and plant groups:  upland grasses, aster, lady slipper, wintergreen, partridge berry, pines, cedars oaks, spruce, ashes, alders, elms, and maples). In places where the shore or bank is of such character that the high water cannot be easily determined (e.g., rockslides, ledges, rapidly eroding or slumping banks), the normal high water mark shall be estimated from places where it can be determined from the method above. 
PERENNIAL STREAM -Any stream channel flowing water year round. 
POND - Any inland body of water that has a surface area in excess of ten or more acres or where such body of water is made and in addition is completely surrounded by land held by a single owner or those privately owned ponds that are held primarily as waterfowl and fish breeding areas or for hunting and fishing. 
PUBLIC WATERS - Those water bodies designated by the Department of Environmental Services in the official “List of Public Waters in New Hampshire;” in the Town of Jaffrey, those water bodies consist of:  Gilson Pond, Thorndike Pond, Frost Pond, Parker Pond, Cheshire Pond, Black Reservoir, Hodge Pond, Gilmore Pond, Scott Pond, Cummings Pond, and Wildlife Pond. 
RIVER -Any free-flowing body of water from that point at which it provides drainage for a watershed of twenty-five square miles to its mouth. 
WETLAND - Wetlands mean an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. (Amended March 8, 2005) 
20.14 Emergency Operations 
Emergency operations shall include operations conducted for the public health, safety, or general welfare (e.g., protection of resources from immediate destruction or loss, law enforcement, and operations to rescue human beings and livestock from the threat of destruction or injury).

REGULATIONS 

SITE PLAN REVIEW REGULATIONS 
Adopted May 13, 1980, and as Amended 
SECTION I:  AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE 

Pursuant to the authority vested in the Jaffrey Planning Board by the voters of the Town of Jaffrey at Town Meeting March 12, 1979, and in accordance with the provisions of 674:43 and 44, New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, the Jaffrey Planning Board hereby adopts the following regulations governing the development or change or expansion of use of tracts for nonresidential uses or multifamily dwelling units (more than two units), whether or not such development includes a subdivision or re-subdivision of the site. These regulations shall be known as the Site Plan Review Regulations. 
The general purpose of these regulations is to promote the health, safety, and prosperity of the town and to preserve and enhance the quality of life, including protection of the community's environment.  Specific aims include safe and attractive development preservation of scenic views consistent with the surrounding properties with particular consideration given to structures or features of historic, cultural, or natural significance; safety from fire, flood, and other dangers; prevention of the overcrowding of land; protection of the quality and availability of water supply and of the quality of light and air; promotion of healthful, safe, and pleasant conditions of habitation; and assurance that the environment will be preserved and protected from avoidable harm and from undesirable and preventable elements of pollution. (Amended 2001) 
SECTION II:  DEFINITIONS 
The definitions contained in the Jaffrey Zoning Ordinance and in the Subdivision Regulations shall apply to the Site Plan Review Regulations where applicable. 
SECTION III: PROCEDURE 
(A) General 
Whenever any development or change of use of a site governed by these regulations is proposed or whenever any changes are proposed that differ from an existing site plan as previously approved by the Planning Board, before any construction, land clearing, building development or change is begun; before any permit for the erection of any building or authorization for development on such site shall be granted; the owner of the property or his authorized agent shall apply for and secure from the Planning Board approval of such proposed site development in accordance with procedures outlined in this regulation. 
Where there is any doubt as to whether a project requires Site Plan Review, the affected party should request a determination from the Planning Board. Said determination as provided for in Section IV of RSA 674:43 shall be recorded in the minutes of the Planning Board. 
In an effort to clarify what constitutes a change of use of sufficient magnitude or impact to trigger Planning Board action, the following guidelines will be observed: 
(1) Activities most likely to be subject to site plan review. 
a) new construction 
b) change of use category 
c) external modification or impact, including parking areas 
d) projects involving a property which has never been subject to site plan review for previous 
non-residential or multi-family use. 
(2) Activities not likely to be subject to site plan review. 
a) projects that involve no change in use or level of activity 
b) internal modification to non-residential use that do not affect scale of impact of existing use 
c) re-use of premises for which site plan review has been conducted, provided the new use is not 
different in type or impact. 
(B) 
Filing of Application 

(1) 
Application forms and a checklist are available from the Planning Board Clerk at the Jaffrey Town Offices during regular business hours.  Upon completion of all submission requirements including four copies of the plat, the applicant shall return the materials to the Planning Board Clerk no later than 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. 

(2) 
The Building Inspector or other designated agent of the Board will then review the plan for completeness.  If the plan is incomplete, the applicant will be advised of the need for a meeting to discuss the necessary steps to take in completing the application.  An incomplete application will not be submitted to the Board. 

(3) 
Upon determination that the application is complete, the Planning Board Clerk will be advised in writing that the application is ready for submission to the Board.  A copy shall be sent to the applicant. 

(4) 
Submission and acceptance of an application shall only occur at a regular meeting of the Planning Board after due notification has been given according to RSA 676:4,I(d).  Acceptance will be by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board members present. 

(5)

(4) 
If the notice for the public hearing was included in the notice of submission or any prior notice, additional notice of the public hearing is not required.  Additional notice is not required of an adjourned session of a hearing provided that the date, time, and place of the adjourned session is made known at the meeting. 

(E) 
Concurrent and Joint Hearings 

The Planning Board may hold a hearing on a site plan review in conjunction with a subdivision hearing if both are required for the same project.  A hearing for site plan review may also be conducted at the same time and place as hearing before the Historic District Commission or the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

(F) 
Approvals 


The Board may grant conditional approval of an application, but the plat will not be signed or recorded until all of the conditions have been met.  If the applicant has not complied with the conditions of approval within one year, the approval is considered null and void, and the applicant must resubmit a new site plan application.  A further public hearing is not required when such conditions: 
(1) 
are administrative in nature; or 

(2) 
involve no discretionary judgment on the part of the Board; or 

(3) 
involve the applicant's possession of permits and approvals granted by other boards or agencies (e.g., the Department of Transportation, the Wetlands Board, or the Water Supply and Pollution  Control Division).  Any subsequent change to the plan based upon such approvals shall require a new application submission. 


Site plan approval shall be considered void if no substantial work is done on the project in one year's time.  The Planning Board may specify the scope of work to be completed within a year's time that will constitute active and substantial development in order for the four-year exemption to apply.  All conditions shall be noted on the plat. 
(G) 
Developments Having Regional Impact 

All applications shall be reviewed for potential regional impacts according to a determination of the Board.  Upon such a finding, the Board shall furnish the regional planning commission and the affected municipalities with copies of the minutes of the meeting at which the determination is made. The copies shall be sent by certified mail within 144 hours of the meeting.  At least 14 days prior to the scheduled public hearing, the Board shall notify by certified mail the regional planning commission and the affected municipalities of the date, time, and place of the hearing and of their right to appear as abutters to offer testimony concerning the proposal. (Amended 2001) 

(H) 
Special Flood Hazard Areas (Amended March 2006)

(E) 	
The stormwater system shall be sized to treat and store the 2 year storm and infiltrate the 1-inch storm. Projects affecting between 10,000 sq ft and 1 acre (43,560 sq ft) of gross floor area and impervious surface may require a stormwater plan if, in the judgment of the Planning Director or Planning Board, there are potential significant impacts such as proximity to wetlands, surface waters, water supply, floodplain or aquifer protection areas. 

(F) 	
The stormwater management system design shall follow the New Hampshire Stormwater Manual, Volumes I-III, NH Department of Environmental Services, 2008 as may be revised from time to time (aka the “Stormwater Manual”). 


Criteria Relative to Noise 
NOISE CRITERIA DEFINITION -words and phrases used herein are defined as follows, in accordance with American Standard S1, 1-1960 entitled Acoustical Terminology: 
‘A’ BAND LEVEL -A band level is the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using the "A" weighting network. The unit of measurement is the dB(A). 
DECIBEL -Decibel is one-tenth root of ten (10), and the quantities concerned are proportional to 
power. 
FREQUENCY -Frequency is measured in the number of sound vibrations in one second. 
Leq -The sound pressure level (SPL) which if integrated over a specific time period interval would 
result in the same energy as a variable SPL integrated over the same period. 
SOUND ANALYZER -A sound analyzer is a device for measuring the band pressure level or 
pressure spectrum level of a sound as a function of frequency. 
SOUND LEVEL METER -A sound-level meter is an instrument including a microphone, an 
amplifier, and output meter, and frequency weighting networks for the measurement of noise and 
sound levels in a specified manner. 
SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL -A sound pressure level in decibels of sound is twenty (20) times the 
logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure 
which reference pressure must explicitly state. 
Noise Measurement -The measurement of sound or noise shall be made with a sound level meter and octave band analyzer meeting the standards prescribed by ANSI S1.4-1971, TYPE 1 and IEC 179. The instruments shall be maintained in calibration and good working order. Octave band corrections may be employed in meeting the response specifications. A calibration check shall be made of the system at the time of any noise measurement. Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representation of the noise source. The microphone during measurement shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement of diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen for the microphone shall be used when required. Traffic, aircraft and other transportation noise sources and other background noises shall not be considered in taking measurements except where such background noise interferes with the primary noise being measured. The slow meter response of the sound level shall be used in order to best determine that the average amplitude has not exceeded the limiting noise spectra set forth. The measurement shall be made at the nearest edge of the residential zoned district on which such noise is perceived, as appropriate, four feet above ground. In the case of an elevated or directional sound or noise source, compliance with the noise limits is to be maintained at any elevation at the boundary. 
SPLs will be measured in the A Weighted Decibel Scale (dBA). The Leq shall be employed when SPL are measured over a period of time rather than individual SPL measurements taken at fixed points in time to assess noise impact. The Leq will be integrated over a specific time period interval.  The Leq will be measured over a 2 hour, 4 hour or 24-hour period at the nearest edge of the residential zoned district. 
Application of Noise Control Methods -Consideration will be given to the application of noise control methods that may be applied to control noise emission sources at the point of generation that are by their very nature noisy (e.g., generators, high velocity/flow pumps, air conditioning units, etc.) as a means to achieve the maximum sound pressure limits as noted in the ordinance. Architectural designed and constructed walls/barriers and acoustical enclosures are sound reduction methods which can result in reducing the sound as the energy passes through the material as a transmission loss (TL). A barrier wall (or other equal means) constructed of concrete, stone, rock or a composite material capable of reducing the SPL to acceptable limits as specified in this ordinance are encouraged. 
Noise Limits. The Jaffrey Site Plan regulations limit daytime and nighttime noise that is “continuous, regular or (a) frequent source of sound”.  During the daytime, a maximum sound pressure limit of 60 dBA measured at the nearest edge of the residential zoning district is allowed.  During the nighttime, a maximum sound pressure limit of 50 dBA measured at the nearest edge of the residential zoning district is allowed. The sound is measured at a height of four feet. 
These standards may be enhanced by adjusting the decibel level limit to sounds that are not continuous and smooth, as follows: 
a. 	
Noise source operated at less than 20% of any one hour period – Plus 5 to limit. 

b. 	
Noise source operated at less than 5% of any one hour period – Plus 10 to limit. 

c. 	
Noise source operated at less than 1% of any one hour period – Plus 15 to limit. 

d. 	
Impulsive/repeating noise character during any one hour period (e.g. – hammering) Minus 5 to limit. 


Noise from safety alarms/signals, warning devices (excluding standard back-up signals on equipment), emergency pressure relief valves, emergency vehicles, emergency work (to protect persons or property), construction noise between the hours of 7:00 am and 7:00 pm on weekdays and 9:00 am and 7:00 pm on weekends and holidays, and unamplified human voices shall be exempt from these standards. 
Wellhead Protection 
In any areas designated by the Town of Jaffrey as groundwater protection and wellhead protection areas for community water systems, as defined in RSA 485:C,2,  (WPAs)  and depicted on the map “Wellhead Protection Areas, Town of Jaffrey, 2012”  the following performance standards shall be followed.

(C) 	
All regulated substances in containers with a capacity of five gallons or more shall be stored in product-tight containers on an impervious surface designed and maintained to prevent flow to exposed soils, floor drains and outside drains.  Such containers shall be secured in facilities to protect against unauthorized entry. 

(D) 	
Secondary containment shall be provided for any outdoor storage of regulated substances if they are stored in a container with the capacity to hold five (5) gallons or more. 

(E)

stations, dry cleaning or laundry facilities, subsurface storage of petroleum products (except 
propane, generator and heating fuels with corrosion control, leak detection and secondary 
containment), or aboveground storage of petroleum products (except propane, generator or heating 
fuels with corrosion control, leak detection and secondary containment) in excess of 500 gallons per 
lot. 
(G) 	All Uses and Activities subject to these regulations shall comply with all applicable state and federal requirements including RSA 147-A, Hazardous Waste Management and Env-Wq 401, Best Management Practices for Groundwater Protection Rules. 
Odors 
Odors.  Discharges causing odors which are regulated by the State of New Hampshire (pursuant to RSA 125-C, et seq.) and/or United States Environmental Protection Agency through the issuance of air permits shall be governed by such emission statutes and regulations. 
Discharges that are not regulated by the State of New Hampshire (pursuant to RSA 125-C, et seq.) and/or the United States Environmental Protection Agency shall be governed by the following standards: 
(A) 	
The emission of odorous air contaminants from any source which results in detectable odors at the lot line of the source, as defined below, shall be prohibited: 

i. 	
For areas used for residential purposes, it is a violation if odors are detected after the odorous air has been diluted with seven (7) volumes of odor free air. 


ii. 	In all other land use areas, it is a violation if odors are detected after the odorous air has been diluted with fifteen (15) volumes of odor free air. 
(B) 	
For the purposes of the Regulation, two odor measurements shall be made within a period of one hour, these measurements being separated by at least fifteen (15) minutes. These measurements shall be made outside the property line of the property from which the emission originates. 

(C) 	
The Barnebey-Cheney Scentometer, suitably calibrated, or any other equivalent instrument, device, or technique may be used in the determination of the intensity of an odor and may be used as a guide in the enforcement of this performance standard.

These regulations are designed to accomplish the purposes set forth in RSA 674:36 and for the purposes of protecting the health, safety, convenience, and economic and general welfare of our citizens. A summary of this statutory authority is presented in Appendix B to these regulations.

(3) 
For purposes of receiving testimony only and not for purposes of notification, the term "abutter" shall include any person who is able to demonstrate that his land will be directly affected by the proposal under consideration. 

(4) 
For purposes of receipt of notification by a municipality of a local land use board hearing, in the case of an abutting property being under a condominium or other collective form of ownership, the term “abutter” means the officers of the collective or association, as defined in RSA 356-B:3, 


XXIII. 
AGENT shall mean a person duly authorized by the landowner to act in his or her stead, demonstrated by a signed letter from the landowner to the Planning Board.

SECTION III:  GENERAL PROVISIONS (Amended 2004) 
(A) 
Land of such character that it cannot, in the judgment of the Board, be safely used for building development purposes because of exceptional danger to health or peril from fire, flood, poor drainage, excessive slope, or other hazardous conditions, shall not be platted for residential, commercial, or industrial subdivision nor for such other uses as may increase danger to life or property or aggravate the flood hazard. 

(B) 
The Board may provide against such scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, sewage disposal, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public services that necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services. The Planning Board may require as a condition of approval for a subdivision or site plan that development shall be so designed and so executed as to preclude runoff onto public or private ways or adjacent properties to include wetlands. In this connection, the Planning Board recommends that new development or changes to existing development adhere to the best management practices as published in the NH Department of Environmental Services booklet “Nonpoint Source Pollution” dated January 2004. 

(C) 
Criteria considered by the Planning Board in evaluation of a proposed subdivision sgall include, but not be limited to, the following goals: 


• 
Blend harmoniously with the surrounding neighborhood. 

• 
Be environmentally sensitive. 

• 
Protect existing and potential water sources. 

• 
Preserve, wherever possible, scenic open space, particularly that visible from the public way. 

• 
Provisions for landscaping and/or visual buffers between the area to be developed and the street(s) to which the subdivision has access. (Amended 2002, 2007) Further details on the criteria applied by the Planning Board in its deliberations regarding proposed subdivisions are presented in Appendix C to these regulations. 


(D) 
Reserve strips that, in the opinion of the Board, show an intent on the part of the subdivider to control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use shall not be permitted. 

(E) 	
In areas not currently served by public sewer systems, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or his agent to provide the necessary state approvals for the installation and operation of an individual sewage disposal system.  In subdividing parcels with existing dwellings, the subdivider must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the existing septic system is in good working order. 

(F) 	
Areas set aside for parks and playgrounds to be dedicated or reserved for the common use of all property owners shall be of reasonable size and character for neighborhood playgrounds or other recreational uses. 

(G) 
All water and sewer mains shall be installed at the extreme sides of proposed streets, to the extent possible and to the required specifications of the Jaffrey Public Works Department.  In subdividing parcels with existing dwellings, the subdivider must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the existing septic system is in good working order.  (Amended 5/11/93) 

(H) 
No more than two lots suitable for building may be served by any one driveway.  (Amended 5/11/93) 

(I) 	
Specifications pertaining to driveways are found in Appendix D to these regulations.  Per paragraph V, RSA 236:13, these specifications pertain to all driveways in the Town of Jaffrey other than those entering onto a Class I, II, or III highway. 

(J) 
For reasons of public safety the Planning Board may require that the applicant furnish an easement enforceable by the Town of Jaffrey to control present or future vegetation which might impinge on sight distances on public or private roads. 

(K) 
Subdivisions will be approved only along roads that meet applicable Town standards. Road design standards and acceptance regulations are found in Appendix A to these regulations. 


SECTION IV:  SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES 
(A) 
Preliminary Conceptual Consultation (Amended 2007) 

(1) 
This phase is optional for minor subdivisions, but required for major subdivisions (as provided in RSA 674:35 Section I).  The applicant for a minor subdivision may request a meeting with the Planning Board to discuss a proposal in conceptual form and in general terms. The applicant for a major subdivision must request a meeting with the Planning Board to discuss a proposal in conceptual form and in general terms.  The Planning Board strongly suggests that all applicants avail themselves of the opportunity to resolve at this early stage any issues that might become a problem later on.  Such preliminary review is directed toward reviewing the basic concepts of the proposal with regard to the Master Plan, Land Use Ordinances, state and local regulations, and a review of checklist items for required submission items. 

(2) 
Preliminary conceptual consultation shall not bind the applicant or the Board.  	Such discussion may occur without formal public notice but must occur only at a posted meeting of the Board. 

(B) 
Design Review Phase (OPTIONAL) 

(1) 
Prior to submission of an application for Board action, an applicant may request to meet with the Board or its designee for nonbinding discussions beyond the conceptual and general stage involving more specific design and engineering details of the potential application. 

(2) 
The design review phase may proceed only after identification of and notice to abutters and the general public as required by RSA 676:4,I(d). 

(3) 
Persons wishing to engage in pre-application design review shall submit a "Request for Pre­application Review" and associated fees not less than 21 days before the regularly scheduled meeting of the Board.  The request shall include: 

(a) 
List of abutters and their addresses from municipal records not more than five (5) days before submission. 

(b) 
A check to cover mailing and advertising costs. 

(4) 
Statements made by Board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating any action eventually taken on the application. 

(C) 
Completed Application (REQUIRED) 

(1) 
Application forms and a subdivision checklist are available from the Planning Board Clerk at the Jaffrey Town Offices during regular business hours. Upon completion of all submission requirements, the applicant shall return the materials to the Planning Board Clerk no later than 30 days before the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. 

(2) 
All plans will be reviewed for completeness by the Building Inspector or other designated agent of the Planning Board.  If the plan is incomplete, the applicant will need to schedule a meeting at which he or she will be advised what information is needed to constitute a complete application.   An incomplete application will not be submitted to the Board. 

(3) 
Upon determination that the application is complete, the Building Inspector or other agent shall inform the Clerk in writing that the application is ready for submission to the Board.  A copy shall be sent to the applicant. 

(4) 
Submission and acceptance of an application shall only occur at a regular meeting of the Planning Board after due notification has been given according to RSA 676:4,I(d). 

Acceptance will be by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board members present. 

(5) 
When a completed application has been accepted by the Board, the Board shall provide a receipt to the applicant indicating the date of acceptance, which is the start of the 65-day review. (Amended (2001) 

(D) 
Board Action on Completed Application 

(1) 
The Board shall begin consideration of the accepted application within 30 days of its submission.  The Board shall act to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the accepted application within 65 days of submission. (Amended 2001) 

(2) 
The Board may apply to the Selectmen for an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days before acting to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove an application.  An applicant may waive the requirement for Board action within the time periods specified in these regulations and consent to such extension as may be mutually agreeable. (RSA 676:4,I[f]) 

(3) 
Approval of the application shall be certified by written endorsement on the plat and signed and dated by the Chairman of the Board.  The Planning Board Clerk is responsible for the filing of the approved plat with the Registry of Deeds of Cheshire County.  The applicant shall submit a check made out to the Town for payment of the recording fees.  Any subdivision plan not filed within 90 days of approval shall be considered void. 

(4) 
If any application is disapproved, the grounds for such disapproval shall be adequately stated in the records of the Planning Board and in written notice given to the applicant within 144 hours of the decision. (Amended 2001) 

(E) 
Expedited Review 

(1) 
The Planning Board may allow for an expedited review of applications for lot line adjustments or minor subdivisions, as defined in Section II of these regulations. 

(2) 
The completed application may be submitted, accepted, and voted on at the same meeting, but no application shall be approved or disapproved without full notice to abutters and the public. 

(3) 
The Board may waive certain plat requirements for minor and technical subdivisions.  	The Building Inspector, in his completeness review, may recommend to the Board in writing certain submission items to be waived.  The Board reserves the final judgment in this matter. 

(F) 
Failure of the Planning Board to Act 

In the event that the Planning Board does not act on an accepted application within the prescribed 65 days, the applicant may petition the Selectmen to issue an order directing the Planning Board to act within 30 days.  If the Planning Board fails to act within 40 days of this directive, the Selectmen must approve the application unless they find in writing that the plan does not comply with a local regulation.  In the event the Selectmen fail to act, the applicant may petition superior court to approve the plan. (Amended 2001) 

(G) 
Conditional Approval 


The Board may grant conditional approval of an application, but the plat will not be signed or recorded until all of the conditions have been met.  If the applicant has not complied with the conditions of approval within one year, the approval is considered null and void and the applicant must submit a new subdivision application.  A further public hearing is not required when such conditions: 
(1) 
are administrative in nature; 

(2) 
involve no discretionary judgment on the part of the Board; or 

(3) 
involve the applicant's possession of permits and approvals granted by other boards or agencies (e.g., Department of Transportation, Wetlands Board, Water Supply and Pollution Control Division); however, any subsequent change to the plan required by such approvals would constitute grounds for a new application process. 

(H) 
Public Hearing 

Prior to the approval of a major subdivision, a public hearing shall be held as required by RSA 676:4, I, (d) with notice given to the applicant, abutters, and all engineers, architects, land surveyors, or soil scientists whose professional seal appears on the plat submitted, and the public.  Public hearings may be waived for lot line adjustments.  Minor or technical subdivisions do not require a public hearing, except that notice to abutters shall be given prior to approval of the application.  If a public hearing is to be held, it shall follow the procedures as outlined in RSA 676: 4, I, (d). 

(I) 
Notices 

(1) 
Notice of a design review or submission of a completed application shall be given by the Board to the abutters and the applicant by certified mail, mailed at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. 

(2) 
The public will be given notice at the same time by posting in the Town Offices and the Post Office and publication in the Monadnock Ledger or the Peterborough Transcript. 

(3) 
The notice shall give the date, time, and place of the Planning Board meeting at which the application or other item(s) will be formally submitted to the Board; it shall include a general description of the proposal that is to be considered and shall identify the applicant and the location of the proposal. 

(4) 
If the notice for the public hearing was included in the notice of submission or any prior notice, additional notice of the public hearing is not required.  Additional notice is not required of an adjourned session of a hearing, provided that the date, time, and place of the adjourned session was made known at the prior meeting. 

(J) 
Developments Having Regional Impact 


All applications shall be reviewed for potential regional impacts according to a determination of the Board.  Upon such a finding, the Board shall furnish the regional planning commission and the affected municipalities with copies of the minutes of the meeting at which the determination was made.  The copies shall be sent by certified mail within 144 hours of the meeting. (Amended 2001) 
At least 14 days prior to the scheduled public hearing, the Board shall notify by certified mail the regional planning commission and the affected municipalities of the date, time, and place of the hearing and of their right to appear as abutters to offer testimony concerning the proposal. 
SECTION V: FEES 
(A) 
All applications shall be accompanied by a check to reimburse the Board for its administrative and notification costs involved in processing applications. The following fee schedule is in effect: 

(1) 
Design Review Phase: 	$25 plus $4.50 per abutter 

(2) 
Lot Line Adjustment/Technical Subdivision: 	$50 plus $4.50 per abutter 

(3) 
Minor or Major Subdivision: 	$100 first lot / $25.00 each additional lot plus $4.50 per abutter 

(B) 
All costs of notices, whether mailed, posted, or published, shall be paid in advance by the applicant.  Failure to pay costs shall constitute valid grounds for the Board to not accept the application as complete. 

(C) 
Pursuant to RSA 676.4,I, (g) it shall be the responsibility of the applicant, if the Board deems it necessary, to pay reasonable fees for special investigative studies, environmental assessments, legal review of documents, administrative expenses, and other matters that may be required to make an informed decision on a particular application.  Failure to pay such costs shall constitute valid grounds for the Board to terminate further consideration of the application and to disapprove the plat without a public hearing. 


The applicant must also be notified of the proposal by certified mail at a cost of $4.50 in addition to the abovementioned fees. 
SECTION VI: PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE 
As a condition of approval, the Planning Board shall require the posting of a performance guarantee in an amount sufficient to defray the costs of construction of streets and public utilities (e.g., water and sewer drains and drainage structures). The amount of the security shall be based on an estimate of costs provided by the subdivider and, at the discretion of the Planning Board, reviewed by a licensed engineer. All costs shall be paid by the applicant. 
(A) 
The security shall be approved as to form and sureties by the Board and the municipal counsel. 

(B) 
The amount of the security shall include fees to cover the cost of periodic inspections.

The Department may require a bond to ensure that the construction meets the Town of Jaffrey Specifications. 
C. 	Driveway Specifications 
1. 	
No driveway shall be constructed within fifty (50) feet of the intersection of two or more public roads. 

2. 	
When two proposed driveways on the same side of the road are within fifty (50) feet of each other, the Planning Board or Department may, for reasons of safety and topographical considerations, require that a common access be used. 

3. 	
Per subdivision regulations Section III (H): No more than two lots suitable for building may be served by any one driveway. 

4. 	
The intersection of driveways with a public road shall be as nearly perpendicular to the road as conditions of the terrain permit. Driveways should be slightly flared at the point of intersection. 

5. 	
The width of driveways shall be proposed by the applicant and approved by the Department.  Driveways shall be of sufficient width and construction as to permit access and use by emergency vehicles. The Department reserves the right to approve a width different than proposed. 

6. 	
If a driveway intersects a paved Town road, the applicant shall pay for pavement of the Town right-of-way between his/her property line and the traveled way. This pavement to be constructed of at least 2 inches (compacted) bituminous concrete and finish grades such as to preclude runoff from the driveway from entering onto or crossing the road. This may be accomplished by having the elevation of the driveway at the intersection lower than the elevation of the side of the road or by construction of a swale or by other means necessary to preclude runoff onto the road. The Department reserves the right to require additional paving outside the right-of-way. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that vehicles leaving the intersection and entering onto the Town road do not damage the Town road.  

7. 	
Unless conditions or terrain preclude, a driveway shall be flat or gently sloping (at least 1% but not greater than 2%) away from the road for a distance of at least 20 feet (two standard car lengths). The Department may request that at least the first 4 feet of the driveway be constructed to prevent surface water from the roadway draining onto the property. 

8. 
A driveway shall be so positioned as to permit a minimum of 200' safe sight distance in either direction. Minimum sight distances are as follows: 


Vehicle speed  Sight Distance (Minimum) (ft)

DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS 
(Adopted 12/14/2010) 
SECTION 1:  AUTHORITY 
Pursuant to the authority granted under the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated 236:13 the Town of Jaffrey Planning Board hereby adopts the following regulations for driveway access to Town roads, public and private. 
SECTION 2: PURPOSE 
The purpose of these regulations is to provide the framework for safe and efficient access to properties, to ensure public safety, preservation of the environment, and protection of Town roads and other Town property. It is the intent to apply appropriate access regulations to land development that will incorporate the needs of the users of the site as well as those using the nearby roadways. It is also the intent to incorporate provisions for safe access opportunities for other modes of transportation such as pedestrian and bicycle. 
SECTION 3: PROCEDURE 
A. 	It shall be unlawful to construct or alter any driveway on any town road or construct a driveway as part of any site plan or subdivision review on any town or state-maintained road,  except when paving an existing driveway and no substantial change is proposed that would in any way substantially affect the size or grade of any driveway, entrance, exit, or approach within the limits of the right-of-way of any highway that does not conform to the terms and specifications of a written permit issued by the Director of Public Works or designee (Department). Substantial change includes change of location, grade or layout and temporary access for Forest Cuts. Temporary access driveway permit applications shall be obtained from, and filed with the Director of Public Works at the same time as the Notice of Intent to Cut. 
B. 	A New Hampshire Department of Transportation driveway permit is also required for any Class I, II or III roads in the Town of Jaffrey.  These roads include U.S. Route 202, State Routes 137 and 124, as well as Dublin Road and Troy Road. In cases where there is a conflict of standards with the Town of Jaffrey, the more restrictive standard shall apply. 
C. 	A written construction permit application must be obtained from, and filed with, the Director of Public Works by any owner, or authorized agent affected by the provisions of Section 3.A. Before any construction or alteration work is commenced, said permit application shall have been reviewed, and a construction permit issued by the Department.  Said Permit shall meet the following specifications: 
Driveway Specifications 
A. No driveway shall be constructed within fifty (50) feet of the intersection of two or more public roads. 
B. When two proposed driveways on the same side of the road are within fifty (50) feet of each other, the Planning Board or Department may, for reasons of safety and topographical considerations, require that a common access be used. 
C. Per subdivision regulations Section III (H): No more than two lots suitable for building may be served by any one driveway. 
D. The intersection of driveways with a public road shall be as nearly perpendicular to the road as conditions of the terrain permit. Driveways should be slightly flared at the point of intersection. 
E. The width of driveways shall be proposed by the applicant and approved by the Department.  Driveways shall be of sufficient width and construction as to permit access and use by emergency vehicles. The Department reserves the right to approve a width different than proposed. 
F. 	If a driveway intersects a paved Town road, the applicant shall pay for pavement of the Town right-of-way between his/her property line and the traveled way. This pavement to be constructed of at least 2 inches (compacted) bituminous concrete and finish grades such as to preclude runoff from the driveway from entering onto or crossing the road. This may be accomplished by having the elevation of the driveway at the intersection lower than the elevation of the side of the road or by construction of a swale or by other means necessary to preclude runoff onto the road. The Department reserves the right to require additional paving outside the right-of-way. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that vehicles leaving the intersection and entering onto the Town road do not damage the Town road.   
G. Unless conditions or terrain preclude, a driveway shall be flat or gently sloping (at least 1% but not greater than 2%) away from the road for a distance of at least 20 feet (two standard car lengths). The Department may request that at least the first 4 feet of the driveway be constructed to prevent surface water from the roadway draining onto the property. 
H. 	A driveway shall be so positioned as to permit a minimum of 200' safe sight distance in either direction. Minimum sight distances are as follows: 
Vehicle speed  Sight Distance (Minimum) (ft)  
30  200  
35  250  
40  305  
45  360  
50  425  

Sight distances are to be measured as follows: Measured at the height of 3.5 feet to represent the height of the driver’s eye in the vehicle stopped in the driveway at a distance of 12 feet back from the intersection of the driveway with the roadway; measured at the height of 3.5 feet to represent the object height of a vehicle on the street approaching the driveway. 
I. No driveway is to have a slope greater than 10%. 
J.  	Driveways shall be constructed as not to impede the natural lateral flow of water. If a culvert is required, the culvert shall be at least as long as the driveway is wide, of sufficient strength so as not to be crushed by the heaviest vehicle expected to use the driveway, and of sufficient diameter to accommodate the largest expected lateral flow of water. Maintenance of this culvert shall remain the responsibility of the property or driveway owner. 
K.  	Driveways constructed in areas of sidewalks or granite curbing-Applicants desiring a new, altered, abandonment, or reconstructed driveway shall apply for a permit. The material of construction of the driveway to be the same as the sidewalk, unless approved by the Department. 
For concrete, the driveway apron shall consist of no less than 6” of 4000 psi, 7% entrained air concrete, finished with light broom finish, or as approved by the Department.  The driveway apron to be constructed to comply with the American with Disabilities Act.  Removed granite curbing shall remain the property of the Town. The driveway shall be constructed as approved by the Department. 
L. If a proposed driveway crosses a wetland or a body of water, permits from the NH Wetlands Board shall be submitted with the driveway application as well as a copy of the Board of Adjustment approval of Special Exception as required by the Wetlands District. 
M.  	Any bridges that may be required shall be constructed in accordance with New Hampshire State Standards and as approved by the Director of Public Works. 
N. Driveways providing access for multi-unit residential, commercial, or industrial uses shall be designed to conform with good engineering practice using the New Hampshire Department of Transportation’s (NHDOT) manual Policy and Procedures for Driveways and Other Accesses to the State Highway System as a guide. 
O. The applicant or his/her agent shall provide 24-hour notice to the Director of Public Works before commencing construction. Final approval to use the driveway shall be granted upon inspection and determination that all work has been satisfactorily completed.   Any surety will be released upon final inspection and approval of construction. 
SECTION 4: BONDS & FEES 
A. 	Residential Driveways. Applicants for a residential driveway access permit shall submit a $50.00 application fee and a $1500.00 security bond to be held until it has been determined by the Director of Public Works, or his designee, that the construction of the driveway is in compliance with this regulation or poses no liability to Town Roads. Upon such determination, the security bond will be returned to the applicant. 
B. 	Multi-Unit Residential, Commercial or Industrial Driveways. Applicants for all Multi-Unit Residential, Commercial or Industrial driveway access permit shall submit a $50.00 application fee and a $1500.00 security bond to be held until it has been determined by the Director of Public Works, or his designee, that the construction of the driveway is in compliance with this regulation or poses no liability to Town Roads.  Upon such determination, the security bond will be returned to the applicant. 
C. 	Improperly Constructed Driveways. If the access is determined to be not properly constructed or poses a liability to Town Roads, the bond will not be returned and the Town shall place a lien on the property in order to recover any additional costs incurred to protect Town Roads. 
D. 	Permit Expiration and Fees. Driveway access permits expire one year from the initial date of construction permission.  Permits may be renewed prior to the expiration without additional fees, provided substantial construction of the driveway has occurred (substantial construction shall be determined by the Director of Public Works or his designee). If not qualified for renewal, the applicant must apply for a new permit and shall pay the additional permit fee of $50.00. 
SECTION 5:  ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT 
A. 	These regulations shall be administered by the Jaffrey Planning Board and Director of Public Works.  The enforcement of these regulations is vested with the Jaffrey Board of Selectmen and the Code Enforcement Officer. 
B. 	The standards of these regulations may be modified or waived by the Director of Public Works, when specific circumstances surrounding the proposal, or the condition of the land, indicate that strict adherence to the standards would not be possible or create an unnecessary burden for the landowner, and such modification or waiver will not be in conflict with the purpose and intent of these regulations. The Planning Board or Director of Public Works may require the owner or authorized agent to engage the services of a professional engineer or other qualified professionals in order to adequately assess the potential results of granting a waiver to the regulation.  All costs incurred shall be the responsibility of the owner.

Areas visible from a public way from which trees have been removed shall be replanted with tree seedlings set out in accordance with acceptable horticultural practices. Native species are preferred, but alternatives listed in the UNH Cooperative Extension “Alternatives to Invasive Landscape Plants” are acceptable. (B) Except for exposed rock ledge, all disturbed areas shall be spread with topsoil or any other soil capable of maintaining vegetation and shall be planted with seedlings or grass suitable to establish permanent vegetation. 

(C) 
All earth and vegetative debris resulting from the excavation shall be removed or otherwise lawfully disposed of. 

(D) 
All slopes, except for exposed ledge, shall be graded to natural repose for the type of soil of which they are composed so as to control erosion or at a ratio of horizontal to vertical proposed by the owner and approved by the Board.  Changes of slope shall not be abrupt but shall blend with the surrounding terrain. 

(E) 	
Any standing bodies of water created by the excavation that are judged to constitute a hazard to health and safety shall be eliminated. 

(F) 	
The topography of the land shall be left so that water draining from the site leaves the property at the original, natural drainage points and in the natural proportions of flow. 

(G) 
For excavation projects requiring a permit from the Division of Water Supply and Pollution Control, the provisions of RSA 485-A:17 shall supersede this regulation.  Copies of all such permits shall be filed with the Board. 


SECTION XI:  INCREMENTAL RECLAMATION 
Except for excavation sites of operating stationary manufacturing plants, any excavated area of five contiguous acres or more that is depleted of commercial earth materials, excluding bedrock, or any excavation from which earth materials of sufficient weight or volume to be commercially useful have not been removed for a 2-year period shall be reclaimed in accordance with Section X of these regulations within 12 months following such depletion or nonuse, regardless of whether other excavation is occurring on adjacent land in contiguous ownership.  A reclamation plan, including a reclamation timetable for the depleted areas within the reclamation site, shall be submitted to the Planning Board for approval. 
SECTION XII: PERFORMANCE BOND (Amended 2004, 2005, 2015) 
Prior to the granting of any permit or to the removal of any topsoil or other overburden material from a new area within an existing excavation site, the applicant shall submit to the Selectmen a bond with sufficient surety, as determined by the Planning Board, to guarantee compliance with the permit.  
Establishment of a commercial excavation site or crushing / processing site may require a bond for town road upgrade and/or damage repair.  Such requirement will depend on location, expected quantity of earth material to be transported, etc.  The regulator will determine the need for any “Road Bond” when reviewing the Permit Application. 
The surety may be in the form of a performance bond, cash, or mortgages or property escrow, irrevocable letter of credit, or any other form approved by the Board.  The surety may be phased to coincide with the phasing of work in an amount sufficient to guarantee reclamation of the applicable section to be released as sections are completed. Prior to a new section being opened, new securities shall be posted. The surety shall not be released until the Board is satisfied that all conditions of the site reclamation plan have been complied with. In requiring a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit, the Planning Board shall include provisions for partial release, upon satisfactory completion or portions of the development or excavation under consideration. 
SECTION XIII:  ADDITIONAL PERMIT REQUIREMENTS 
For any excavation requiring a permit, the standards of Sections IX and X are considered minimum standards; the operation may be subject to additional conditions of the permit, consistent with the purpose of these regulations, as deemed necessary by the Planning Board. 
SECTION XIV:  EXCEPTIONS 
Due to the diverse nature of excavation operations that vary in scale and scope, and due to the varying conditions of the land to be excavated, the Board may, upon application and following a duly-noticed public hearing, grant any exception in writing to the standards contained in Sections IX, X, XI, and XII for good cause shown.  The written decision shall state specifically what requirements are being waived and include any reasonable alternatives.

DESIGN GUIDELINES 
For Non-Residential Development 
Subject to Site Plan Review 

Purpose 
These guidelines have been developed to promote the goals of the Downtown and Master Plans vision statements, excerpted below. 
Downtown Plan 
Downtown Jaffrey is recognized as the cultural and financial anchor of a well balanced, thriving community. A carefully crafted mix of small town charm and economic vitality has established downtown as a destination for business owners and patrons alike. 
Attractive gateways frame each approach to the town center, beckoning the passerby with a hint of the friendly atmosphere and unique character awaiting them inside. This layout provides the visitor with a sense of place, and reveals the proud tradition of public and private investment that has made downtown Jaffrey a convenient and desirable place to gather and a great place to do business… 
Master Plan 
…Jaffrey will seek to attract new commerce and industry that will provide good jobs and career opportunities for Jaffrey's youth and work force. Jaffrey shall be a business-friendly community that promotes economic development by supporting a dynamic, diversified economic base consistent with its small town character.  This economic base is likely to consist of small and home-based businesses, small retail and service establishments, light industry, and tourism. 
The town's future development strategies should respect the value of community resources by preserving historical architecture and other historical features, providing a supportive environment for our cultural, social, and medical support organizations, and ensuring that a program of continuous improvement is instituted for our schools and recreational facilities. Jaffrey's future will include an expanded and prosperous downtown.  We envision additional opportunities for safe foot and bicycle travel in and around the town, with improved vehicular flow through the town center… 
In developing these guidelines two overlay district types have been defined, General Business and Gateway. These guidelines are designed to provide a flexible framework which: 
• 	
Promotes development consistent with Jaffrey’s historical character and mix of uses in the downtown area; 

• 	
Creates a sense of entry and cohesion into town through established corridors and gateways; 

• 	
Enhances Jaffrey’s sense of place and community; 

• 	
Coordinates pedestrian and bicycle opportunities with transportation improvements. 


Overlay Descriptions 
The Overlay Districts are defined as follows and shown on the map found in the appendices titled Design Guidelines Overlay Districts. 
Downtown Business Overlay 
Includes the General Business District and the Main Street Program Area (excluding Silver Ranch and VFW General Business Districts). The four Gateways are defined as follows: 
Gateway Overlays The design guidelines pertain to lots having frontage along designated roadways. Cheshire Pond Gateway -extending from the northerly edge of the Downtown Business District to the intersection of Nutting and Old Sharon Roads.
