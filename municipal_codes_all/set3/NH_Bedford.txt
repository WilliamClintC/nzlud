CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
GENERAL REFERENCES
Conduct of public officials  See Charter, Art.
VII.
§ 13-1. Purpose.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to RSA 31:39-a and the Town of Bedford
Charter.2 It is intended to guide public servants in balancing private
interests and their obligations to the public, and to ensure consistency
in the application of conflict-of-interest standards. It is further intended
to recognize a distinction between conflicts that may arise when a public
servant is acting in a legislative or quasi-judicial capacity. This chapter
recognizes that the area of matters on which public servants must pass
is of such a wide range that almost every public servant must inevitably
have some interest that may conceivably be affected by some legislative
proposal. It is not the intention of this chapter to prevent persons who
are peculiarly suited for public office by reason of their commercial or
professional experience from contributing their services to the community
and to encourage individuals who do not have a conflict of interest, as
provided herein, to participate in the decisionmaking process.
§ 13-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BOARD  Any board, committee, or commission, permanent or special,
appointed or elected.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST  A situation, circumstance, or financial interest
where a public officer votes on a matter in which he or she or a member
of his or her family has a direct, personal and pecuniary interest which is
immediate, definite, capable of demonstration, and not remote, uncertain,
contingent and speculative, such that a person of ordinary capacity and
intelligence would not be influenced by it.
EMPLOYEE  A person who is paid by the Town of Bedford for his or her
services, but who is not an independent contractor.
FAMILY  Any person who is related to the public servant in one of
the following ways: spouse, domestic partner, parent, grandparent, child,
grandchild, sibling, or similar relation to the individual's spouse. This
includes all persons who are members of the same household as the public

§ 1-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 13-2
1:7
servant in question, regardless of whether they are related by blood or
marriage.
LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY  A circumstance where a public servant is
engaged in the enactment of legislation, including ordinances and
regulations, or similar matters.
PECUNIARY INTEREST  Any advantage in the form of money, property,
commercial interest or anything else, the primary significance of which is
economic gain; it does not include economic advantage applicable to the
public generally, such as tax reduction or increased prosperity, generally.
PUBLIC SERVANT  All officials, officers and employees of the Town,
whether elected, appointed, paid or unpaid.
QUASI-JUDICIAL ACTION  Any action where the board or committee
members are acting like a judge or jury, where there is a duty to notify
potential parties, hear the parties, and decide on a matter after weighing
and considering such evidence and arguments as the parties choose to lay
before the board.
RECUSE  To disqualify or seek to disqualify from participation in a
decision on grounds such as prejudice or personal involvement.
§ 13-3. Conflicts of interest enumerated.
A. Public servants should avoid legal conflicts of interest.
Public servants shall not appear on behalf of a client or friend before
any governmental body of which the public servant is a member.
B.
A public servant shall not participate in any quasi-judicial matter in
which he or she, or a member of his or her family, has a personal or
pecuniary interest that may directly affect or influence the performance
of his or her duties. In such instances, the public servant shall recuse
him or herself from discussion and decisionmaking.
C.
No public servant shall inappropriately influence a party in any
business, transaction, or private employment, or have any direct
financial or other private interest that is in conflict with the proper
discharge of his or her official duties.
D.
No public servant shall use or attempt to use his or her position as a
public servant to obtain any financial gain, contract, license, privilege
or other private or personal advantage for the public servant or any
person, firm or organization associated with the public servant.
E.
No public servant shall coerce or attempt to coerce, by intimidation,
threats or otherwise, any public servant to engage in political activities.
F.
No public servant shall receive any type of compensation, except from
the Town, for performing any official duty. The receipt of gifts of a
nominal value which a reasonable person could not construe as being
capable of influencing a decision shall not create a conflict of interest.
G.
§ 13-2 BEDFORD CODE § 13-3
1:8
§ 13-4. List of nominal gifts.4
At the end of each calendar year, the Town Manager shall submit a list of
nominal gifts (over $50 cumulatively from one vendor) received by all Town
employees and boards and commissions. The Town Council Chairperson will
add any Council gifts to that list, and the list will be placed on file in the
Town Manager's office.
§ 13-5. Duty to disclose and to recuse.
Examples of gifts of nominal value would be but are not limited to
business grand openings, benefit golf tournaments, thank-you food
baskets. Appointed officials who are given a gift shall inform the
chairman of the board or commission they sit on. Town employees
shall inform their department head and/or the Town Manager of, and
receive approval for, any gift received. Any Town official who is acting
in a legislative or quasi-judicial matter, who has accepted any type of
gift in the past from a person or company presenting to the board or
commission they sit on must disclose said gift to the rest of the board
prior to any discussion on the item.3
No public servant acting in a legislative capacity may participate in
discussions, deliberations or decisions with respect to a matter in which
he or she has a direct, personal and pecuniary interest different from
that of a member of the general public. Any public servant who has
any interest in the legislative matter shall publicly and on the record
state all dealings, interest, and/or relationships (including employer/
employee) that might compromise the public servant's objectivity or
create a situation in which there was a potential of unfair economic
advantage or the possibility of improper financial gain.
A.
No public servant, acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, shall participate,
by means of discussion, deliberation or vote in any matter in which he
or she has a direct, personal and pecuniary interest which is immediate,
definite, and capable of demonstration, not remote, uncertain,
contingent and speculative, such that a person of ordinary capacity and
intelligence would not be influenced by it.
B.
Public servants have a duty to recuse themselves from participating in
a specific action or discussion where a conflict of interest exists.
C.
A public servant having a conflict of interest may not be seated with
other members during any discussions, deliberations or votes on the
matter in which the conflict exists, but may remain in the hearing room,
and may speak so long as it is clearly stated for the record that that
public servant is doing so only as a member of the general public.

the public servant may request, following full disclosure, that the board
vote on the question as to whether that member should recuse him or
herself. Any such request and vote shall be made prior to or at the
commencement of any required public hearing. Such a vote shall be
advisory and nonbinding and may only be requested by board members.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 212-1. Purpose and objectives; applicability.
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth uniform requirements for
the use of public and private sewers and drains, private wastewater
disposal, the installation and connection of building sewers and the
use of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) for the Town of
Bedford, County of Hillsborough, State of New Hampshire and will
enable the Town to comply with all applicable state and federal laws,
including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and the general
pretreatment regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The Town of Bedford,
New Hampshire, discharges wastewater to the City of Manchester's
publicly owned treatment works for treatment and disposal, and these
regulations shall be at least as stringent as the City of Manchester's
Sewer Rules and Regulations.
A.
Recognizing that significant opportunities exist to reduce or prevent
pollution at its source through cost effective practices, and that such
practices can offer savings through reduced purchases of materials
and resources, a decreased need for pollution control technologies, and
lower liability costs, as well as assisting to protect the environment,
the Town of Bedford establishes the following objectives of this chapter.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will interfere with its operation;
(1)
Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will pass-through the publicly owned
treatment works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or
otherwise be incompatible with the publicly owned treatment
works;
(2)
Protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may
be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their
employment and the general public;
(3)
Promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the publicly owned treatment works;
(4)
Provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned
treatment works; and
(5)
B.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment
works. The chapter authorizes the issuance of individual wastewater
discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and
enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures;
requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the

§ 212-2. Statutory authority.
In order to ensure proper removal and disposal of sewage wastes and
wastewaters within the region, to ensure the proper operation and
maintenance of public sewers, drains, treatment plants, and other drainage
or sewerage works within the region, and to provide for keeping adequate
records of sewers, drains and appurtenances, and connections thereto, the
following chapter regulating the user charge and cost recovery program,
the construction, use, repair, alteration, and discontinuance or
abandonment of sewers, drains, and appurtenances, the connections
thereto, including drains and pipes discharging directly or indirectly into
said sewers or drains, and the substances to be discharged directly or
indirectly into and through sewers, drains, and appurtenances of the public
sewerage system and storm drainage system of the region is hereby enacted
by the Town Council, as provided by RSA 149-I:6, including special acts
approved by the State Legislature and by the laws of the State of New
Hampshire.
§ 212-3. Powers and authority of Town Council.
equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein.
The Town Council shall make all rules and regulations for the use of
the Bedford wastewater collection system facilities within the Town of
Bedford and shall see to the enforcement of contracts or agreements
between the Town and the City of Manchester, regional communities,
industries, and commercial establishments pertaining to wastewater
treatment and municipal sewer facilities.
A.
The Director shall have supervision and management of the wastewater
collection system.
B.
The Town Council shall set the rates in accordance with Article IX, to be
charged by the users of the wastewater collection system, which rates
may be varied from time to time when the Town Council shall deem
such to be necessary for the wastewater collection system to remain
self-supporting.
C.
The Town Council shall have the authority to set up a separate and
distinct account for the wastewater collection system.
D.
The Town Council shall have the power to submit to the Collector of
Taxes with a warrant, under the hands and Seal of the Town, requiring
the collection of all delinquent sewer use charges, and the Collector
shall have the same rights and remedies and be subject to the same
liabilities in relation thereto as in the collection of taxes.
E.
The Town Council shall employ such engineering, administration,
clerical, and other personnel as it may require for the proper discharge
of its powers and duties.
F.
§ 212-1 BEDFORD CODE § 212-3
1:118
The Town Council shall have the power to exact a penalty charge as
a means of recovering both interest and additional cost of billing and
collecting on delinquent sewer use accounts, said penalty to become
progressively heavier in proportion to the period of delinquency.
G.
The Town Council shall have the power to issue and enforce rules
and regulations relating to the wastewater collection system, related
pumping stations and interceptors, and/or other appurtenant
structures, as are required for proper maintenance and operation. Any
person willfully violating such ordinances or bylaws shall be guilty of a
violation for each day of violation after written notice to desist has been
given.
H.
The Town Council reserves the authority to review all requests and to
accept or deny any applications for sewer connections outside of the
established sewer district. The presumption shall be that no properties
outside of the established sewer district shall be connected. Criteria for
review for such requests shall include but not necessarily be limited to
the following:
The applicant must prove acute septic system failure (the inability
of the land to support a septic system for existing commercial
or residential property) as a condition of review. Substandard
performance of existing septic system(s) when system upgrading or
replacement would cure the problem does not meet the standard of
proving acute failure;
(1)
The applicant has no alternative, including acquiring rights in
additional land;
(2)
The applicant shall agree to bear the cost of sewer extension,
although Town Council reserves the right to share or advance funds
to cover all or a portion of the cost, with reimbursement through
user-charge assessments;
(3)
(4) The best interests of the Town are served;
Existing capacity of the sewer system, existing commitments for
sewer connection, and estimated future demand.
(5)
I.
The Town Council may grant a waiver to those properties with adequate
alternative sewage disposal systems which comply with applicable state
regulations in accordance with RSA 147:8 and Administrative Rule Env-
Wq 1003.10 designed by a designer licensed in New Hampshire and
approved for construction by the DES (New Hampshire Department
of Environmental Services) after January 1, 1985. Upon the need for
repair and/or replacement of the disposal system, the property must
then connect to the public sewer system (REF. RSA 147:8 and subject
to all applicable fees).

located a public sanitary sewer of the Town is hereby required at his
expense to install suitable sanitary facilities therein, and to connect
such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter within 90 days after the date of official
notice to do so by the Director, provided that said public sewer is
determined to be accessible and available by the Town and located
within 100 feet of the dwellings/structure. The Town Council reserves
the right to grant a waiver to the requirement of connection to the
public sewer for properties with adequate alternative sewage disposal
systems which comply with applicable state and local regulations, and
where the best interests of the Town are served.
A.
Extensions greater than 90 days. Extensions greater than 90 days
may be granted by the Town Council to individual property owners
upon appeal. Said extension shall be granted only when it can be
demonstrated that the connection to the public sewer system would be
unpractical to construct and that an agreement between the owner and
the Town Council be enacted. Said agreement shall be conditioned on
the following:
The wastewater from the subject property not be discharged
directly to any natural outlet;
(1)
The property is served by an acceptable subsurface disposal
system, as determined by the DES;
(2)

If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the wastewater collection system that exceed the
standards or restrictions established in sections of this chapter, which
in the judgment of the Director may have a deleterious effect upon the
POTW, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or that otherwise
create a hazard to worker safety or health, or constitute a public
nuisance, the Director may:
Reject or prevent any discharge to the POTW after notice has been
served to the discharger and the discharger has had reasonable
opportunity to respond;
(1)
(2) Require pretreatment prior to discharge to the POTW;
Require control (e.g., equalization) over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
(3)
Require payment to cover additional cost of handling and treating
the wastes.
(4)
D.
Maximum allowable POTW headworks loadings limitations. The
numerical pollutant loading limitations in compliance with the City of
Manchester's local limits are presented in Appendix C.66

§ 212-34. Screening levels.
The Director shall calculate and administer daily concentration limits
(i.e., local limits) when required as described below to ensure that
the combined industrial pollutant discharge loadings do not cause or
contribute to exceedences of these limitations. For industrial discharge
applications, the local limits shall apply at the end of the process train
prior to dilution with nonindustrial wastewaters.
F.
Daily concentrations are the concentration of a pollutant discharged,
determined from the analysis of a flow-composited sample (or other
sampling procedure approved by the Director) representative of the
discharge over the duration of twenty-four-hour day or industrial
operating schedule of less than 24 hours.
G.
All concentration limits for metals represent total metal unless
indicated otherwise. The Director may impose mass limitations in
addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations.
H.
Local limits are developed based on the identification of users known to
be discharging each pollutant (industrial contributory flow procedure).
Unless specifically identified in an industrial discharge permit, a user
shall not discharge the locally limited pollutants at concentrations 20%
greater than the background concentrations used for local limits
development.
I.
The following pollutants shall not be discharged to the wastewater
collection system exceeding concentrations listed below without
approval of the Director:
The municipality may develop and include a list or include in
specific discharge permits.
(1)
A.
Screening levels are numerical values above which actions are initiated
to evaluate, prevent or reduce adverse impacts due to flammability,
chemical reactivity, organic/solids loadings, or worker health and
safety.
B.
If any of the screening levels are exceeded, repeat analysis must be
performed to verify compliance or noncompliance with that screening
level. If noncompliance is confirmed, then the user may be required, at
the discretion of the Director, to conduct an appropriate engineering
evaluation to determine the potential impact of the discharge of this
pollutant to the Town's wastewater collection system or alternatively,
to develop a pollution prevention plan specifically addressing the
pollutant that exceeds the screening level. This study or plan must
be conducted under the supervision and approval of the Town. Should
the evaluation indicate the impact to be unsatisfactory, the user shall
reduce the pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level. If the
evaluation supports development of an alternate site-specific limitation,

§ 212-35. Monitoring of prohibited discharges.
In all premises where wastes or substances specified to be excluded from
sewers or drains by this chapter are customarily present and liable to be
discharged directly or indirectly into any public sewer or drain, suitable and
sufficient piping layouts, oil or grease interceptors, or separators, screens,
sedimentation chambers, storage, regulating, treatment equipment, and
similar devices or equipment shall be provided, maintained, and operated,
as required by the Town Council, to ensure that no waste, substance, or
water required to be excluded from said sewer or drain shall be discharged
there into in violation of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 212-36. Sampling and treatment requirements.
Required sampling and treatment of prohibited discharges. At premises
where any of the substances or wastes prescribed as being or to be
excluded from any sewer or drain are present and liable to be discharged
contrary to the limitations of this chapter, the Town Council may require
that the owner, at the owner's expense, of said premises provide, operate,
and maintain a sampling well or wells, a flow-measuring device, manholes,
catch basins, or other suitable devices or treatment facilities on any or all
building sewers or drains from said premises near the point or points where
said drains connect to any public sewer or drain.
§ 212-37. Pretreatment facilities.
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all limits, prohibitions, and
requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified
by the EPA, the state, or the Director, whichever is more stringent. All
facilities required to achieve and maintain compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing
then the screening level shall be adjusted and administered as a limit
for the specific discharge.
Special agreements. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the Town and any user whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Town for treatment
provided that said agreements do not contravene any requirements
of existing federal or state laws, and/or regulations promulgated
thereunder, are compatible with any user charge system in effect, and
do not waive applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards.
Special agreement requests shall require submittal of a pollution
prevention plan that specifically addresses the discharge for which a
special agreement is requested. For pollutants with numerical local
limits, the Town has allocated a percentage of its allowable industrial
loadings for such special agreements. Requests for special agreements
that exceed this allocation will not be approved.
D.
§ 212-34 BEDFORD CODE § 212-37
1:156
such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director
for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director and the DES before
such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to
the Town under the provisions of this chapter.
§ 212-38. Additional pretreatment measures.
Whenever deemed necessary to protect the wastewater collection
system and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of
this chapter, the Director may require users to restrict their discharge
during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points
of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary.
A.
The Director may require any person discharging into the wastewater
collection system to install and maintain, on their property and at
their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. An industrial discharge permit may be issued solely
for flow equalization.
B.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided at the owner's
expense when, in the judgement of the Director, these devices are
necessary for the preliminary treatment of wastewater containing
excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Director and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly,
as required by local and state codes. The owner shall be responsible for
the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured
materials and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal,
which shall be subject to review by the Director. Any removal and
hauling of the collected materials shall be performed by currently
licensed waste disposal firms.
C.
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter and alarm.
D.
Where pretreatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, these devices shall be maintained
continuously to ensure satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at his expense.
E.
Sampling. By means of said sampling well or wells or other devices, the
owner, owners, and occupants of said premises and the Town Council,
or any public officer charged with any duty involving the supervision
of the disposal of wastewaters, may secure samples of or examine the
F.
§ 212-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-38
1:157
§ 212-39. Maintenance of preliminary treatment facilities.
Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any water or
wastewater, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at no expense to the Town.
§ 212-40. Inspection of preliminary treatment facilities.
The Town or its authorized representative shall have the right to enter and
inspect any part of any premises served by the public sewers and drains
of the Town upon which there may be reason to believe that violations of
the requirements of this chapter have occurred or are likely to occur, for
the purpose of ascertaining facts as to such violation or suspected violation,
or of obtaining samples of wastes, substances, or waters being discharged
into sewers or drains, or of inspecting devices provided to exclude such
prohibited discharges.
§ 212-41. Accidental discharge/slug control plans.
At least once every two years, the Director shall evaluate whether each
significant indirect discharger needs an accidental discharge/slug control
plan. The Director may require any user to develop, submit for approval,
and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the Director may develop such a
plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address,
at a minimum, the following:
wastes and wastewaters discharged into said public sewer or drain
and measure the quantities thereof for the purpose of ascertaining the
compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of this chapter.
Installation and operating expenses. All such devices and facilities shall
be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible at all times. The Town may require that
the owner perform and keep records of all monitoring and/or sampling
data and submit said records upon request to local, state, or federal
officials.
G.
Sampling methodology. Sampling shall be carried out following 40 CFR
Part 136 to reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.
H.
A dental practice which applies, alters, maintains or removes mercurycontaining
dental amalgam shall install, operate and maintain an
amalgam separator(s) in accordance with DES Env-Wq 306.

1:158
§ 212-42. Pollution prevention plans.
The Director may require any person discharging wastes into the
wastewater collection system to develop and implement, at that person's
own expense, a pollution prevention plan. The Director may require users
to submit as part of the pollution prevention plan information that
demonstrates adherence to the following elements:
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection
and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials,
loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker
training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
D.
Management support. For changes to be effective, the visible support
of top management is required. Management's support should be
explicitly stated and include designation of a pollution prevention
coordinator, goals, and time frames for reductions in volume and
toxicity of wastestreams, and procedures for employee training and
involvement.
A.
Process characterization. A detailed process waste diagram shall be
developed that identifies and characterizes the input of raw materials,
the outflow of products, and the generation of wastes.
B.
Waste assessment. Estimates shall be developed for the amount of
wastes generated by each process. This may include establishing and
maintaining waste accounting systems to track sources, the rates and
dates of generation, and the presence of hazardous constituents.
C.
Analysis of waste management Economics. Waste management
economic returns shall be determined based on the consideration of:
(1) Reduced raw material purchases;
(2) Avoidance of waste treatment, monitoring and disposal costs;
(3) Reductions in operations and maintenance expenses;
(4) Elimination of permitting fees and compliance costs; and
Reduced liabilities for employee/public exposure to hazardous
chemicals and cleanup of waste disposal sites.
(5)
D.
Development of pollution prevention Alternatives. Current and past
pollution prevention activities should be assessed, including estimates
of the reduction in the amount and toxicity of waste achieved by the
identified actions. Opportunities for pollution prevention must then
be assessed for identified processes where raw materials become or
generate wastes. Technical information on pollution prevention should
be solicited and exchanged, both from inside the organization and out.

§ 212-46. DES industrial wastewater indirect discharge request
requirement.
All significant industrial users must receive DES approval for any new
industrial discharge, or any alteration in either flow or waste
characteristics. Such approvals shall be obtained in accordance with DES
Env-Wq 305 and this chapter.
Evaluation and implementation. Technically and economically feasible
pollution prevention opportunities shall be identified and an
implementation timetable with interim and final milestones shall be
developed. The recommendations that are implemented shall be
periodically reviewed for effectiveness.
F.
The review and approval of such pollution prevention plans by the Town
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibilities of modifying
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Town in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
G.
No significant indirect discharger shall discharge wastewater into the
wastewater collection system without first obtaining an industrial
discharge permit from the Director, except that a significant indirect
discharger that has filed a timely and complete application pursuant
to this chapter may continue to discharge for the time period specified
therein.
A.
The Director may require other users to obtain industrial discharge
permits, or submit an application for an industrial discharge permit, as
necessary to execute the purposes of this chapter.
B.
Any violation of the terms and conditions of an industrial discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall subject
the industrial discharge permittee to the enforcement actions set out in
this chapter. Obtaining an industrial discharge permit does not relieve
a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal state, and local law.

Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of a user to maintain its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
B.
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors
any pollutant more frequently than required by the Director, using the
procedures prescribed in Sections 6.11 and 6.12 of this chapter, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
C.
The Director may require the user to submit such information as may
be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including
the submittal of an industrial discharge permit application under this
chapter.
A.
Upon approval of the request by the Director, an industrial wastewater
indirect discharge request may be submitted by the Town to DES on
behalf of the user. All applicable DES review fees shall be provided by
the user.
B.
Upon approval of the discharge request by DES, the Director may
issue an industrial discharge permit or modify an existing industrial
discharge permit under this chapter in response to changed conditions
or anticipated changed conditions.
C.
A DES sewer connection permit, in accordance with § 212-22 of this
chapter, may be required.
D.
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause adverse
impacts to the wastewater collection system, the user shall immediately
telephone and notify the Director of the incident. This notification
shall include identifying the location of the discharge, type of waste,

§ 212-62. Reports from unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain an industrial discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the Director as the Director may require.
§ 212-63. Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting.
If the results of sampling performed by a user indicate a violation, the
user shall notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit
the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days subsequent
to becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample
if the Director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if
the Director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user
receives the results of this sampling.
§ 212-64. Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part
136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Town.
§ 212-65. Sample collection.
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions conducted
by the user.
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived
by the Director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s)
of the discharge and the measures to be conducted by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be
incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater collection system,
natural resources, or any other damage to person or property, nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other
liability that may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
B.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's employee bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a discharge described in Subsection A above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur
or who may be present when a discharge occurs are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
C.
Except as indicated in Subsection B below, the user shall collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not practical,

§ 212-66. Timing.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, the date of receipt of the
report be the person designated in the industrial discharge permit shall
govern.
§ 212-67. Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter
and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact location, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) obtaining the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least five years. This period shall
be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the Town, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Director. Before destroying the records, the user
shall request and receive permission from the Town.
the Director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a
minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this
will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
In addition, grab samples may be required to demonstrate compliance
with instantaneous discharge limitations (e.g., screening levels
established to protect worker health and safety). A single grab sample
may also be used in place of a composite sample with approval of the
Director when:
The effluent is not discharged on a continuous basis (i.e., batch
discharges of short duration), and only when the batch exhibits
homogeneous characteristics (i.e., completely mixed) and the
pollutant can be safely assumed to be uniformly dispersed;
(1)
Sampling a facility where a statistical relationship can be
established between previous grab samples and composite data;
and
(2)
The waste conditions are relatively constant (i.e., are completely
mixed and homogeneous) over the period of the discharge.
(3)
Samples for temperature, pH, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic
compounds shall be obtained using grab collection techniques.

§ 212-68. Pollution prevention reports.
Permitted users discharging pollutants on the local limits or pollution
prevention action lists of this chapter, at concentrations greater than
background levels, shall report annually on pollution prevention activities
undertaken to reduce or minimize the generation of wastes containing these
pollutants. The Town may publicize these efforts in the annual notification.
§ 212-69. Special agreements permitted.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the City and Town and
any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength
or character may be accepted by the Town for collection and City for
treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern, provided
that such agreements do no contravene any requirements of existing federal
or state laws, and/or regulations promulgated thereunder, and are
compatible with the user charge system.
§ 212-70. Septage discharge prohibited.
No septage shall be discharged to the Town wastewater system.
§ 212-71. Dilution of wastes.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on users
who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations
is appropriate.
A.
Users implementing process changes may request that compliance
be determined based on mass limitations in lieu of concentration
limitations. Such mass-based limitations will be calculated from the
permitted concentration-based limitations and flows, and shall be
equivalent to or less than the mass discharge in effect at the time of
the request. The intent of a mass-based limit is to encourage and allow
pollution prevention and/or water conservation measures that might
cause a facility to increase pollutant concentrations in its discharge
even though the total mass of the pollutant discharged does not
increase, and may in fact decrease. Decisions on granting requests
for mass-based compliance limitations will be based on user-specific
information and current operating conditions of the wastewater
collection system, and will be at the discretion of the Director.
Implementation of mass-based limitations may not contravene any
requirements of federal or state laws and/or regulations implemented
thereunder and may not waive applicable categorical pretreatment
standards.

commercial, industrial, or manufacturing purposes without first having
obtained a permit from the Town.
§ 212-73. Application requirements.
Any person desiring to install a garbage disposal unit shall first make
application in writing to the Town upon a form provided by it for that
purpose, which application shall state the name and address of the
applicant, the address of the premises in which such installation is desired,
and a general description of the premises and the existing sewerage system
within the premises affected.
§ 212-74. Review of application.
Upon filing of such application, the Town shall, within a reasonable
time, cause the premises and the available sewer system to be
inspected and surveyed and, from the findings so obtained, determine
upon such change or alteration in such system as, in its opinion, shall
be necessary before issuing an approval of the application.
A.
No such approval shall be issued in any instance where the capacity
of the public sewerage system within the particular sewer district shall
be insufficient, or where the additional demand and service caused
by the use of such garbage disposal unit shall be likely to impair the
efficiency of such sewerage system. A reasonable time in this case
shall be considered to mean no more than two weeks from the date of
application.

allow unrestricted access by Town, State and EPA personnel ["Inspector(s)"]
for the purpose of determining whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this chapter, and any industrial discharge permit or order
issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Inspector(s) ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
If a user has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the Inspector(s) will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
A.
The Inspector(s) shall have the right to set up on the user's property,
or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
B.
The Inspector(s) may require the user to install monitoring equipment
as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure accuracy.
C.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the Inspector(s) and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
user.
D.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Inspector(s) access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
E.
The Inspector(s) is authorized to obtain information concerning
industrial processes that have a bearing on the kind or source of
discharge to the public sewer. The user may request that the
information in question not be disclosed to the public. The information
in question shall be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES
permit, or the pretreatment program. The burden of proof that
information should be held confidential rests with the user. However,
information regarding wastewater discharge by the user (flow,
constituents, concentrations, and characteristics) shall be available to
the public without restriction.

§ 212-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-75
1:175
§ 212-76. Search warrants.
If the Director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the Town designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit
or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Director may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Manchester District Court.
§ 212-77. Right of entry through easements.
Duly authorized employees of the Town, bearing proper credentials and
identification, shall be permitted to enter all private properties through
which the Town holds an easement for the purposes of, but not limited to,
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance
of any portion of the sewage works lying within said easement. All entry and
subsequent work, if any, on said easement shall be done in full accordance
with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private
property involved.
§ 212-78. Confidential Information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, industrial
discharge permit applications, industrial discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Director's inspection and sampling activities, shall
be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director,
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes,
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated
by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report that might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program,
and in enforcement proceedings involving the person providing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as
While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in this section, the Inspector(s) shall observe all safety rules applicable
to the premises established by the user. The user shall be held harmless
for injury or death to the Inspector(s), and the Town shall indemnify
the user against loss or damage to its property by Town employees
and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property
damage asserted against the user and growing out of the monitoring
activities, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the
user to maintain safe conditions.

compliance schedule. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section shall
comply with the following conditions:
§ 212-83. Pollution prevention plan development.
The Director may require any user that has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, an industrial discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to develop
a pollution prevention plan. The pollution prevention plan must specifically
address violation(s) for which this action was undertaken. The pollution
prevention plan shall be developed using good engineering judgment and
shall be submitted to the Director no later than 60 days after the user was
notified of this requirement.
Any person or user who willfully or negligently violates any provision
of this chapter or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a violation, punishable by a fine not to exceed
$1,000 for each violation. Every separate provision violated shall
constitute a separate violation. Every day that a violation occurs shall
be deemed a separate violation.
C.
The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards, including, but
not limited to, retaining an engineer, completing preliminary and final
design plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing
and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine
operation;
A.
B. No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
The user shall submit a progress report to the Director no later than
14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance which identifies, as a minimum, whether or not it complied

a list of the users that, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
§ 212-85. Show cause orders.
The Director may order any person or user which causes or contributes to
violation of this chapter or wastewater permit or order issued hereunder,
to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the offender specifying the time and place for
the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such
action, and a request that the offender show cause why this proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall
be served personally or by certified mail (return receipt requested) at least
10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any person,
principle executive, general partner, or corporate officer. Whether or not
a duly notified offender appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action
may be pursued.
§ 212-86. Cease and desist orders.
§ 212-87. Consent orders.
The Director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances
of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders shall
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period also specified by the order. Orders may also contain
such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate
to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment
systems, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. Such
When the Director determines that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
Implement such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may
be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,

to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of wastewater collection system personnel or the
public. The Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with
the operation of the wastewater collection system or that presents, or
may present, an endangerment to the environment.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
terminate or eliminate its wastewater discharge. In the event of a
user's failure to immediately comply with the suspension order, the
Director may implement such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the wastewater collection system, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings of
this chapter are initiated against the user.
(1)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and
the measures implemented to prevent any future occurrence, to the
Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing
of this chapter.
(2)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
B.
Nothing herein contained shall be interpreted to prevent any individual
industry or group of industries from erecting, maintaining, and
operating a private sewer treatment facility, such facility to be
designed, constructed, and operated in accordance with the applicable
local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, and regulations.

uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment
that is part of the public sewerage system. Any person violating this
provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly
conduct pursuant to the local ordinances, and shall also be subject to
penalties under state and federal statutes.
§ 212-94. Injunctive relief.
When the Town determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, an industrial discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Town may petition the Court through the Town's Attorney for the issuance
of an ex parte temporary judicial relief, as appropriate, that restrains or
compels the specific performance of the industrial discharge permit, order,
or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user.
The Town may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal
and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, implementing any other action against a user.
§ 212-95. Civil penalties.
All private treatment facilities shall be operated by a person licensed by
the State of New Hampshire for the class of facility to be operated and
shall employ a full-time treatment plant operator.

chapter, an industrial discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the
Town for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation, per day, plus
actual damages incurred by the wastewater collection system. In the
case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
A.
The Director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the Town. The Director shall petition the Court to impose,
assess, and recover such sums.
B.
In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall consider all
relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm
caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other
factor as justice requires.

be guilty of a violation, punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000 for
each violation. Every separate provision violated shall constitute a separate
violation. Every day that a violation occurs shall be deemed a separate
violation. (Ref. RSA 47:17, I, RSA 149-I:6, RSA 31:39, III.)
§ 212-97. Nonexclusive remedies.
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Town may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. However, the Town may pursue other action against any user without
limitation, including ex parte temporary judicial relief to prevent a violation
of this chapter. Further, the Town is empowered to pursue more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
§ 212-98. Upset.
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, implementing any other action against a user.
D.
For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
pretreatment standards due to factors beyond the reasonable control
of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or
careless or improper operation.
A.
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of
Subsection C, below, are met.
B.
A user who intends to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence, that:
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(1)
At the time being of the upset, the facility was operated in a
prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with
applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
(2)
The user has submitted the following information to the Director
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (If this information
is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five days.):
(a) A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(3)
C.
§ 212-95 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 212-98
1:185
§ 212-99. Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions of this chapter or
the specific prohibitions of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference
and that either:
§ 212-100. Bypass.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the amount of time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(b)
Action being implemented and/or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(c)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
D.
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with pretreatment standards.
E.
Users shall control all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or
failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies
in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
F.
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the passthrough
or interference; or
A.
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Town
was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
B.
For the purposes of this section:
"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
(1)
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence
(2)
A.
§ 212-98 BEDFORD CODE § 212-100
1:186
of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provisions of Subsections C and D of this section.
B.
Notice.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Director, at least 10 days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
(1)
A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of
the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the amount of time it is expected to continue;
and steps implemented or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the
written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
(2)
C.
Enforcement and approval by Director.
Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may initiate enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
Bypass was required to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
(a)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass that
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and
(b)
The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C of
this section.
(c)
(1)
The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, subsequent to
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection (D)(1) of this
section.

for paying the cost of construction, payment of interest on debt incurred,
management, maintenance, replacement, operation, and repair of the
Town's sewer system and appurtenant structures, as well as the Town's
share of the City's wastewater treatment facilities. Said sewer rental
charges shall consist of a service charge and a sewer user charge.
§ 212-106. Responsibility of owners for payment of charges.
Sewer rental charges for residential premises, commercial establishments,
and industrial establishments shall be paid by the owner of any such
structure containing one or more dwelling units, commercial
establishments, or industrial establishments from which structure sewage
discharges into the Town sewer system.
§ 212-107. Occupied or unoccupied premises; multiple dwelling
units.
The Town of Bedford has developed and is implementing a program
for the construction and operation of wastewater treatment facilities.
A regional treatment plant and pumping station have been constructed
by the City of Manchester and a system of interceptor sewers has been
partially completed by the Town of Bedford. Under the requirements
of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit issued
to the Town of Bedford by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, the treatment and disposal works became partially operational
on April 1, 1984. Under the requirements of said permit, the Town is
proceeding with the completion of said program.
A.
The purpose of this article is to ensure that all persons whose mains
enter main drains, common sewers, and treatment facilities and all
persons whose lands receive or will receive a special benefit from said
wastewater treatment facilities shall pay their just share of the costs of
said facilities as hereinafter provided.
B.
An additional purpose of this article is to comply with the user charge
requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Act Amendments of 1972

of wastewater discharged by users.
B.
Measurements of BOD and SS content. Strength shall be determined
from the BOD and SS content of the wastewater as determined by
periodic composite sampling by the Town.
C.
Samplings. Said periodic composite sampling shall be conducted by or
under the supervision of the Chief Sanitary Engineer of the City of
Manchester, as an authorized representative to the Town, to an extent
that will permit a reasonable determination of BOD and SS.

IMPACT FEE  A fee or assessment imposed upon development,
including subdivision, building construction, or other land-use change,
in order to help meet the needs occasioned by the development for
the construction or improvement of capital facilities owned or operated
by the municipality, including and limited to water treatment and
distribution facilities; wastewater treatment and disposal facilities;
sanitary sewers; stormwater, drainage and flood-control facilities;

open space.
B.

authorized to assess impact fees, as herein defined, and in accordance
with the standards herein set forth. The Planning Board shall have
the authority to adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this
chapter. Impact fee formulas may be adopted in the Bedford Zoning
Ordinance, the Bedford Subdivision Regulations, and/or the Bedford
Nonresidential Site Plan Regulations.
C.
Assessment methodology.
The amount of any impact fee shall be a proportional share of
municipal capital improvement costs which is reasonably related to
the capital needs created by the development, and to the benefits
accruing to the development from the capital improvements
financed by the fee.
(1)
Upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructures, the need for
which is not created by new development, shall not be paid for by
impact fees.
(2)
In the case of development created by a change of use,
redevelopment, expansion, or modification of an existing use, the
capital facilities fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in
the impact created by the new use as compared to that which was
or would have been assessed for the previous use.
(3)
D.
E. Administration of impact fees.
§ 275-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-20
1:289
Each impact fee shall be accounted for separately, shall be
segregated from the Town's general fund, may be spent upon order
of the governing body, and shall be used solely for the capital
improvements for which it was collected, or to recoup the cost of
capital improvements made in anticipation of the needs for which
fees are collected to meet.97
(1)
All impact fees shall be assessed at the time of Planning Board
approval of a subdivision or site plan. When no Planning Board
approval is required, or has been made prior to the adoption of this
section, impact fees shall be assessed prior to, or as a condition for
the issuance of a building permit or other appropriate permission
to proceed with development. [Amended 3-8-2005]
(2)
Impact fees shall be collected at the time a certificate of occupancy
is issued. If no certificate of occupancy is required, impact fees
shall be collected when the development is ready for its intended
use. [Amended 3-8-2005]
(3)
The Town of Bedford and the assessed party may establish an
alternate, mutually acceptable schedule of payment of impact fees
in effect at the time of subdivision plat or site plan approval by the
Planning Board. [Amended 3-8-2005]
(4)
If an alternate schedule of payment is established, the Town of
Bedford may require developers to post bonds, letters of credit,
accept liens, or otherwise provide suitable measures of security
so as to guarantee future payment of the assessed impact fees.
[Amended 3-8-2005]
(5)
In the event that bonds or other debt instruments have been issued
for public capital facilities which were constructed in anticipation
of new development, or are issued for advanced provision of capital
facilities identified in this chapter, capital facilities fees may be
used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments.
(6)
Waiver and appeal of fees.
Any person may request from the Planning Board, a full or partial
waiver of capital facilities fee payments required by this section
where it can be shown that reduced impact or no new impact will
be created due to mitigating circumstances.
(1)
On-site and off-site improvements which are required by the
Planning Board as a result of subdivision or site plan review,
including but not limited to extension of water and sewer mains or
the construction of roads or other infrastructure, which would have
to be completed by the developer regardless of the capital facilities
fee provisions, shall not be considered eligible for waiver under this

section. Any aggrieved party may appeal any decision under this
§ 275-20 to the Superior Court as provided for in RSA 677:15.98
Refund of fees paid. Any fee payer shall be entitled to a refund of that
fee, plus accrued interest where:
The capital facilities fee has not been encumbered or legally bound
by the Town Council to be spent for the purpose for which it was
collected within a period of six years from the date of the final
payment of the fee; or
(1)
The Town Council has failed, within the period of six years from
the date of the final payment of such fee, to appropriate the nonfee
share of related capital improvement costs.
(2)
G.
Credits.
Land for capital facilities and/or public capital facility
improvements may be offered by the fee payer as total or partial
payment of the required fee. The offer must be determined to
represent an identifiable dollar value computed in a manner
acceptable to the Planning Board.
(1)
The Planning Board may authorize to the fee payer a capital
facilities fee credit in the amount of the value of the contribution.
Any claim for credit must be made no later than the application
acceptance and public hearing on the development proposal before
the Planning Board. Determinations made by the Planning Board
pursuant to the credit provisions of this section may be appealed to
the Superior Court as provided by RSA 677:15.
(2)
H.
Periodic review of fee schedules. The capital facilities fee schedules
found in the Bedford Land Development Control Regulations shall be
reviewed annually by the Planning Board using the methodology
established in the schedules. Such review may result in the Planning
Board recommending to the Town Council that adjustments be
approved in one or more of the fees. Adjustment of the fees shall
not be approved more frequently than once per fiscal year. Schedule
adjustments to the recreation impact fee or the Kilton Road impact fee
which would change the methodology prescribed in the Bedford Land
Development Control Regulations shall be made only by amendment to
this chapter.99
I.
Applicability. This chapter shall not be deemed to affect the existing
authority of the Planning Board over subdivisions and site plans,
including but not limited to the authority to declare a development to be
premature or scattered in accordance with the regulations of the Board
and in accordance with RSA 674:36, II(a).

NH RSA 126-X, authorizing the use of therapeutic cannabis, and
to regulate the location and operations of alternative treatment
centers, so as to promote and protect the public health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the Town of Bedford. The intent of this
Subsection is to:
Provide for the safe sale and distribution of therapeutic
cannabis to patients who qualify to obtain, possess and use
cannabis for medical purposes under RSA 126-X and as
managed by the New Hampshire Department of Health and
Human Services; and
(a)
Protect public health and safety through reasonable limitations
on business operations as they relate to location, noise, air,

L.
Definition. The permitted density is the number of dwelling units
allowed in the development. This number shall not exceed the number
which would be allowed using conventional subdivision requirements
for the zoning district(s) in which the cluster residential development
is proposed except for density bonuses permitted for workforce
ownership housing developments provided for in Subsection B of this
section. [Amended 3-10-2009]
A.
Computation of permitted density. The total number of dwelling units/
lots that shall be permitted on a tract of land proposed for a cluster
residential development shall be determined by the following steps:
B.
§ 275-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-33
1:315
§ 275-34. Design requirements.
Computation of lot size [Amended 3-12-1996]
Where municipal sewerage facilities or municipal water
facilities will serve the development, compute the minimum
lot size using Table 1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, in
§ 275-22, Dimensional Regulations;
(a)
Where community or individual septic systems and community
or individual wells will serve the development, compute the
minimum lot size using Table 1A of the soils and steep slope
regulations of the Subdivision Regulations of the Town of
Bedford.
(b)
(c) The computation is a weighted average of all usable soils.
Usable soils are the soils of the tract minus surface water
bodies, 100% of Hydric A soils and 75% of Hydric B soils, and
soil types classified as "N/A" (Not Allowed) identified in Table
1A. [Amended 3-11-1997]
(d)
(1)
Compute the dwelling unit density by using the following formula:
Divide the "net developable area" (see definition) by the
minimum lots size as computed in Subsection B(1)(a) or (b).
[Amended 3-12-1996]
(a)
One additional lot shall be permitted for each four acres of
Hydric B. [Amended 3-11-1997]
(b)
(2)
Sites in more than one zone [Added 3-14-1989]
If the proposed cluster residential development is located in
more than one zoning district, then the total number of
dwelling units allowed within the tract shall be the sum of
those allowed for the portion of land lying within each zoning
district.
(a)
Where the calculation results in a fraction of a unit, and the
fraction is 1/2 or greater, the number of units may be rounded
to the next larger whole number.112
(b)
(3)
Diversity and originality. Diversity and originality in lot layout and
individual building design shall be encouraged to achieve the best
possible relationship between development and the land.
A.
Drainage. Natural surface drainage channels shall be either
incorporated into the overall site design or shall be preserved as part of
the required open space.
B.

Architectural styles. Architectural styles which are compatible with the
natural amenities and topography of the site will be encouraged.
C.
Design priorities. Lots, buildings, streets, parking areas, and cluster
units shall be designed and arranged to:
(1) Minimize alteration of the natural site features to be preserved;
(2) Relate to surrounding properties;
(3) Improve the view from and view of buildings;
(4) Lessen the area devoted to motor vehicle access; and
Avoid the adverse effects of noise, shadows, lights, and traffic on
the residents of the development.
(5)
D.
Open space.
That portion of the common open space area which is not
comprised of environmentally sensitive areas, but which is
comprised of land suitable for parks, recreation, conservation, or
agricultural purposes, shall have a shape, dimensions, character,
and location that will ensure its usability for those purposes by
all residents of the CRD. Forty percent of the minimum common
open space area, all of which is suitable for parks, recreation,
conservation, or agricultural purposes, shall be retained in
contiguity. The first acre of such common open space retained in
contiguity shall have a minimum horizontal dimension, whether
length or width, of 200 feet, and there shall be an additional 25 feet
of minimum horizontal dimension for each additional acre of such
common open space retained in contiguity. [Amended 3-14-2000]
[Example #1. In the case of a minimum CRD tract area of 15
acres, 25% of the tract, or a total of 3.75 acres, is required for
common open space. Forty percent of the common open space
which amounts to 1.5 acres, is required to be contiguous and
suitable for parks, recreation, conservation, or agricultural
purposes, and have a minimum dimension of 200 feet. The acre
and a half of usable open space which would be provided in this
minimum size CRD is a reasonable area for a small neighborhood
playground or passive park.]
[Example #2. A one-hundred-acre CRD would yield 25 acres of
common space of which 10 acres would be required to be
contiguous and suitable for parks, recreation, conservation, or
agricultural purposes with a minimum dimension of 425 feet. Ten
acres of usable open space represents an adequate area to support
park facilities and playfields, or alternatively, is coincident with
the current use standards for a range of open space uses including
agriculture and forestry.]

Buffer zone.
All single detached dwellings, together with any accessory
buildings, structures, and other man-made improvements,
shall be located a minimum of 50 feet from the external
boundary of a cluster residential development. The fifty-foot
perimeter buffer shall be comprised of existing vegetation and
shall be included in the square footage of each lot area. The
Planning Board may permit roads, driveways and utilities to
cross through the buffer as needed to access lots within the
development. [Amended 3-8-2016]
(a)
All single attached dwellings, together with any accessory
buildings, structures, and parking facilities, shall be located a
minimum of 100 feet from the external boundary of a cluster
residential development. The Planning Board may permit
streets and utilities to cross through the one-hundred-foot
buffer area, and may allow certain outdoor recreational
facilities within this area, provided that such improvements
are compatible with adjacent land uses. Existing vegetation,
including significant large trees, shall be preserved in this

§ 275-35. Management requirements.
An integral part of the cluster residential development submission requires
the preparation and presentation to the Planning Board, by the developer,
of the proposed articles of association or incorporation which establishes
the homeowners' association. Said document must be approved, in writing,
by the Planning Board prior to the granting of development approval, but
only after legal review by the Board's counsel. The cost of such legal review
shall be borne by the developer. Any proposed changes in such articles of
association or incorporation shall require the prior written approval of the
Planning Board. The following shall apply to the provisions of the articles of
association or incorporation:
setback is eliminated. Where a zero lot line arrangement is proposed
for single detached dwellings located on individual lots, the Planning
Board may allow one of the side yard setbacks to be reduced or
eliminated in a consistent pattern for all lots, provided that the side
yard setbacks on adjacent lots shall not be eliminated in such a manner
so as to result in the single detached dwellings located thereon sharing
a party wall. [Added 3-14-2000]
Design standards for single attached dwelling for elderly and workforce
housing. [Added 3-14-2000; amended 3-10-2009]
There shall be a maximum of four single attached dwellings per
building. There shall be a minimum of 50 feet of separation
between all such buildings.
(1)
Each single attached dwelling shall have available a private yard of
at least 500 square feet adjacent to the building and dedicated to
the exclusive use of the residents of said building. The private yard
space may contain patios, decks, fences, landscaping, gardens, and
other outdoor facilities. [Amended 3-10-2009]
(2)
The installation of residential sprinkler systems shall be required
for buildings containing single attached dwellings. Where
municipal water service is not available, on-site water storage
facilities shall be designed and installed to provide fire protection
and suppression capabilities for buildings containing single
attached dwellings. [Amended 3-11-2008]
(3)
Workforce ownership housing units shall be designed to be similar
in exterior appearance, scale and massing and be otherwise
visually indistinguishable from market-rate units in the
development. They shall also be geographically dispersed
throughout the development. [Added 3-10-2009]

Membership.
Membership in the homeowners' association shall be mandatory for
cluster subdivision property owners and made a required covenant
in all deeds issued or passed.
(1)
A.
§ 275-34 BEDFORD CODE § 275-35
1:320
The association shall provide voting and use rights in the open
space area(s) when applicable and may charge dues or levy
assessments to cover expenses which may include tax liabilities
of common areas and for the maintenance of such common areas,
open space areas, improvements, rights-of-way, utilities, etc.
(2)
Such organization shall be responsible for the perpetuation,
maintenance, and function of all common lands, uses, and facilities.
(3)
Restrictive covenants.
All lands and improvements shall be described and identified as to
location, size, use, and control in a restrictive covenant.
(1)
These restrictive covenants shall be written so as to run with the
land and become a part of the deed of each lot or dwelling unit
within the development.
(2)
B.
Continuance of restrictive covenants and the association.
Such restrictive covenants and the association shall continue in
effect so as to control the availability of facilities for their intended
function, and to protect the development from additional
unplanned densities and use.
(1)
Such association shall not be dissolved, nor shall such association
dispose of any common, open space or natural land by sale or
otherwise, except to an organization or association conceived and
organized to own and maintain such areas, without prior written
consent of the Planning Board.
(2)
C.
Open space land.
Except as may otherwise be allowed by the Planning Board in
accordance with this article, any and all open space lands within
a cluster residential development tract shall be held in common
ownership by the dwelling unit owners. [Amended 3-14-2000]
(1)
All open space, however, has been set aside to lessen the
environmental impact of subdivisions on the Town. Therefore, any
change in the open space, other than to maintain it in reasonable
order and condition in accordance with the approved final plan,
requires prior written approval of the Planning Board.
(2)
D.
Failure to maintain open space areas.
Notification by Town. In the event that the organization established
to own and maintain the open space areas, or any successor
organization, or the owner or owners of the dwelling units located
within the development who own said open space shall, for any
reason, fail to maintain the open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the approved final plan, the Town
Council shall serve written notice upon such organization,

§ 275-36. CRD options involving two noncontiguous tracts [Added
3-14-2000]
The Planning Board is authorized to administer and grant conditional use
permits to allow a CRD to include two noncontiguous tracts: one tract for
development on which all dwelling units will be developed and a second
tract which will provide for the minimum common open space. Options
available through the conditional use permit process include the retention
of the open space tract by the homeowners' association or the conveyance
of the open space tract, for permanent protection purposes, to a
governmental entity or to a private land trust. Where the proposed open
space tract includes developable land and is of an area that exceeds the
successor organization, or residents setting forth the deficiencies
in the maintenance, order, and condition of the open space.
Contents of notice. Such notice shall include a demand that said
deficiencies be cured forthwith and that a statement of intent to
comply and a date of compliance shall be filed with the Town
Council within 14 days of said notice.
(2)
Public hearing. If such maintenance shall not have been performed
or said statement of intent shall not have been filed by the stated
time, the Town Council shall hold a public hearing, with notice
to the officers of the organization and notice as required by RSA
676:4(d). At the hearing, the organization or the residents of the
development shall show cause why such maintenance has not been
performed. [Amended 3-11-2003]
(3)
Court action. Following the hearing, the Town may initiate court
action to remedy the violation, including the right to enter and
perform the necessary maintenance, the right to recoup costs
associated with such maintenance, the right to place liens on
individual units, the right to levy fines, and the right to collect
attorney's fees. [Amended 3-11-2003]
(4)
Compatibility with existing documents. Provisions of this section
shall in no way be in derogation of, or supplant the rights of the
Town as provided in any declaration or other documents related to
a cluster which are recorded in the Registry of Deeds. [Amended
3-11-2003]
(5)
Cost of such maintenance by the Town.
The cost of such maintenance by the Town shall be assessed
against the properties in the development in direct relation to their
proportionate interest in the common area and shall become a tax
lien on said properties.
(1)
At the time of entering upon said common areas for the purpose of
maintenance, notice of such lien shall be filed in the office of the
Hillsborough County Register of Deeds.

1:322
requirements for common open space, the tract, or a portion thereof, may
be transferred to the tract that is to be developed for dwelling units as part
of the CRD.
Retention of the open space tract by a homeowners' association. Where
the tract to be retained as open space is located within 1/4 mile of the
tract that will be developed such that the residents of the CRD will
have ready access, an unobstructed view, or other benefit from the open
space tract, the Planning Board may allow the CRD to occur on two
tracts, provided that the open space tract is encumbered by covenants
and restrictions that permanently protect its status as open space, and
that the open space tract is linked by deed or other appropriate legal
instrument to the dwelling units on the development tract. The distance
between tracts shall be measured in a straight line, from property
boundary to property boundary.
A.
Conveyance of the open space tract. Where the tract to be retained as
open space is deemed important to the Town of Bedford in accordance
with the Town's officially adopted open space plans and policies, the
Planning Board may allow the CRD to occur on two tracts, provided that
the open space tract is conveyed, subject to covenants, restrictions,
or agreement, to a governmental entity or to a private land trust.
In granting a conditional use permit under these circumstances, the
Planning Board shall make a finding that the open space benefits to the
community from the cluster residential development occurring on two
lots exceed any benefits to be derived from the protection of common
open space that would otherwise occur in a standard cluster residential
development on a single tract. The Planning Board shall also approve
the deed of conveyance including all covenants and restrictions, and
any maintenance agreements concerning the open space.
B.
Transfer of the right to develop dwelling units. In any application for a
conditional use permit for a CRD including two noncontiguous tracts,
where the size of the open space tract exceeds the area requirements
for common open space in accordance with this article, and where
the excess area of the open space tract meets the standards of net
developable area in accordance with § 275-32L, Net developable area,
of this chapter, the Planning Board may allow the transfer of the right
to develop dwelling units that would otherwise be able to be built on
that excess portion of the open space tract to the CRD development
tract. The maximum number of units that can be transferred under
these circumstances is equal to the number of dwelling units that
could theoretically be developed on an area equivalent to 90% of the
minimum required open space area in accordance with § 275-32J,
Common open space, of this chapter, when subjected to an analysis of
the net developable area and the permitted density standards of this
article. In granting a conditional use permit under these circumstances,
the Planning Board shall make a finding that the water supply and
subsurface wastewater disposal facilities available to the development
C.
§ 275-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-36
1:323
tract are capable of accommodating the additional dwelling units to be
transferred from the open space tract.
Open space requirement for the development tract. In a CRD which
includes two noncontiguous tracts, the tract on which all dwelling units
will be developed shall retain a minimum of 10% of the minimum
open space as required pursuant to § 275-32J, Common open space,
of this chapter. No more than a 1/4 of said common open space shall
be comprised of environmentally sensitive areas, and the location and
arrangement of said common open space shall comply with the
standards of § 275-34E, Open space, of this chapter.
D.
A quarter of a mile limitation on the separation between noncontiguous
tracts is imposed upon those CRDs where the association would retain
ownership of the open space. A minimum requirement is set forth for
open space to be retained within the development tract. A total of 10%
of the required open space must be retained with the development
tract. Therefore, 90% of the required open space on the development
tract is available for the transfer of dwelling units from the
noncontiguous open space tract. [Amended 3-14-2000113]

Performance Zoning District116
§ 275-56. Statutory authority. [Amended 3-8-1994]
This Article VIII is enacted by the Town of Bedford pursuant to RSA 674:21,
II. This innovative land use control ordinance shall provide for all approvals,
including the granting of conditional or special use permits, by the Planning
Board. Any decision made by the Planning Board under this innovative land
use control ordinance may be appealed directly to Superior Court in the
same manner provided by statute for appeals from the Planning Board,
as set forth in RSA 676:5, III, and RSA 677:15. A waiver process from
particular requirements set forth in Article VIII may be employed by the
Planning Board where the applicant demonstrates substantial compliance
with the standards set forth in Article VIII, § 275-58, Purpose, Subsections
A through E.
§ 275-57. Intent.
§ 275-58. Purpose. [Amended 3-13-2012]
The purposes of this Performance Zoning District Ordinance are:
Zoning was first implemented as a technique for separating
incompatible types of land development, thereby protecting lowintensity
uses from the harmful or disagreeable impacts of highintensity
uses. However, conventional zoning may produce its own set
of undesirable side-effects.
A.
As design and technology continually change in the marketplace, new
types of land uses are proposed which cannot be easily assigned to
existing zoning classifications. Too often, innovative land developments
are either denied outright (resulting in loss of tax revenue to the
municipality), appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment (where
special conditions are imposed), or subjected to lengthy rezoning
procedures (requiring a Town-wide ballot vote).
B.
Performance standards measure the quantifiable impacts of each
proposed development rather than prohibiting certain classes of land
use. This type of zoning offers an alternative method for implementing
community goals as outlined in the 1990 Bedford Master Plan and
the 1983 Route 3 Corridor Study, while protecting the right of private
property owners to utilize their land according to highest and best use.
C.
To attract environmentally acceptable commercial, industrial,
recreational, institutional, and residential uses to the District;

Table of Performance Dimensional Standards.
In order to accomplish the stated intent and purpose of this article,
as well as ensure that the goals and objectives of both the 1990
Bedford Master Plan and the 1983 Route 3 Corridor Study are
fulfilled, performance zoning standards enumerated within Table
3, Table of Performance Dimensional Standards, have been
developed.122
(1)
No building or structure shall be erected, enlarged, altered, or
relocated, nor shall any existing lot size be changed or new lot
created within the Performance Zoning District, except in
accordance with the Table of Performance Dimensional Standards
or as otherwise specified within this article. [Amended
3-13-2012]
(2)
A.
Incentive bonus standards.
In recognition of the need to protect the overall integrity and
character of the Performance Zoning District, as well as to promote
the development of a system of local roads and utilities for properly
servicing properties within the Performance Zoning District, the
performance zoning standards presented in Table 3, Table of
Performance Dimensional Standards, have been formulated so as
to include incentive bonus standards. [Amended 3-13-2012]
(1)
These incentive bonus standards have been created as means for
rewarding those who choose to voluntarily develop their properties
in a way that is most compatible with the stated goals and
objectives of the 1990 Bedford Master Plan and the 1983 Route 3
Corridor Study.
(2)
Incentive bonus standards which are implicit in these performance
zoning standards include:
Minimum lot areas and frontage.
Purpose. Recognition that less restrictive minimum lot
area and frontage requirements for sites which either
front on local roads or have shared access from Route 3
can promote favorable development along this corridor,
without adversely affecting traffic patterns.
[1]
Reduction in minimum lot area and frontage. As an
incentive bonus to encourage this concept of local road
construction and/or shared access, minimum lot area and
frontage requirements will be relaxed from a minimum lot
size of three acres with 300 feet of frontage, to 1.5 acres
with 150 feet of frontage when a municipal water supply
and/or municipal sewer is not available.

§ 275-62 BEDFORD CODE § 275-62
1:348
Waiver of soils and steep slopes regulation. The Planning
Board may further waive the soils and steep slopes
regulation contained within the Subdivision Regulations of
the Town of Bedford, New Hampshire, for sites created
under this incentive bonus standard. (See Figure 4,
Incentive Bonus Standards.123)
[3]
Municipal sewer and water connections.
Purpose. Recognition that sites created which take
advantage of the incentive bonus standard outlined above
should have an additional incentive bonus to expend funds
for connection to municipal sewer and a municipal water
supply.
[1]
Reduction in minimum lot area and frontage. This
incentive bonus standard is provided by allowing these
sites to further reduce minimum lot area to one acre with
75 feet of frontage.
[2]
Waiver of construction improvements. This incentive is
provided in order to offset the cost of providing these
utilities. This incentive bonus can also be attained by
contributing funds to a Town-administered fund for future
utility connection in lieu of actually constructing these
improvements at the time of subdivision. (See Figure 4,
Incentive Bonus Standards.)
[3]
(b)
Easement deeds.
Land within 50 feet of U.S. Route 3. Recognition that
individuals who voluntarily agree to provide easement
deeds over that portion of their land within 50 feet of
the present center line of U.S. Route 3, thereby reserving
this easement area for future widening or similar
improvements to this corridor, may be compensated for
this action by being allowed to develop their properties
to an extent greater than that allowed by the maximum
impervious coverage requirements otherwise permitted
within this district.
[1]
Excess impervious coverage. The amount of excess
impervious coverage allowed being equal to the actual
computed area of the easement area provided for future
improvements. (See Figure 3, Incentive Bonus Formula for
Route 3 Easement.124)

Table of Performance Dimensional Standards,126 may be
reduced if all the following criteria are met:
A parcel of land, with an area greater than or equal to the
difference between the minimum required lot area from
Table 3, Table of Performance Dimensional Standards, and
the proposed lot area is deeded in fee simple to the Town
of Bedford or a nonprofit organization acceptable to the
Bedford Town Council;
[1]
Those utilizing this performance standard must offer any
land, which is not to be retained by the subdivider, to
the Bedford Town Council. In considering any such offer,
the Town Council may elect to accept the land for Town
ownership and use; reject the offer; or defer ownership
to a third party, nonprofit organization of their selection
for permanent use as public recreation, conservation, open
space, or historic preservation;
[2]
The parcel to be retained by the subdivider shall meet
applicable NHDES lot sizing criteria when public sewers
are not available at the time of subdivision. Further, the
Planning Board may elect to waive the soils and steep
slopes based lot sizing requirements contained within the
Subdivision Ordinance of the Town of Bedford;
[3]
Any parcel created under this performance standard shall
have a total area of not less than 1/2 acre.
[4]
(e)
Intent. To preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the
Performance Zoning District by establishing a matrix of landscape
design and planting options which perform in relationship to the
intensity of the proposed land use. It is anticipated that through the
implementation of landscape strips and incentive bonuses, the
following objectives can be accomplished: [Amended 3-13-2012]
Diminish potentially adverse impacts of structures, lighting glare,
noise, wind velocities, and odors which could result from
permitting widely varying land uses on adjacent parcels;
(1)
Ensure that each tract of land has benefit of an adequate buffer
between neighboring parcels in order to preserve and protect
property values;

Correction of deficiencies. Any deficiencies found with regard to
these items shall be corrected and may require the installation
of additional plantings prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for the property.
(2)
C.
Reclamation of disturbed areas. All areas disturbed by construction
shall be covered with a minimum thickness of four inches of suitable
topsoil and be subsequently planted with grass seed, sod, or other
vegetative ground cover.
D.
Waiver of landscape requirements when necessary for public safety.
None of the landscape requirements contained within this article shall
be construed so as to require installation, where proper site distance at
drives or along public streets may be inhibited by such improvements.

Watercourses with a designated regulatory floodway.
Along watercourses with a designated regulatory floodway, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development are allowed within the
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practices that the proposed encroachment would not
result in any increase in flood levels within the community during
the base flood discharge. [Amended 3-13-2007]
(1)
In Zone A, the Building Code Official shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any floodway data available from federal, state,

As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
METEOROLOGICAL TOWER (MET TOWER)  Includes the tower, base
plate, anchors, guy wires and hardware, anemometers (wind speed
indicators), wind direction vanes, booms to hold equipment for
anemometers and vanes, data loggers, instrument wiring, and any
telemetry devices that are used to monitor or transmit wind speed and wind
flow characteristics over a period of time for either instantaneous wind
information or to characterize the wind resource at a given location. For the
purpose of this chapter, met towers shall refer only to those whose purpose
is to analyze the environmental factors needed to assess the potential to
install, construct or erect a small wind energy system.
MODIFICATION  Any change to the small wind energy system that
materially alters the size, type or location of the small wind energy system.
Like-kind replacements shall not be construed to be a modification.
NET METERING  The difference between the electricity supplied to a
customer over the electric distribution system and the electricity generated
by the customer's small wind energy system that is fed back into the electric
distribution system over a billing period.
POWER GRID  The transmission system, managed by ISO New England,
created to balance the supply and demand of electricity for consumers in
New England.
SHADOW FLICKER  The visible flicker effect when rotating blades of the
wind generator cast shadows on the ground and nearby structures causing
a repeating pattern of light and shadow.
SMALL WIND ENERGY SYSTEM  A wind energy conversion system
consisting of a wind generator, a tower, and associated control or
conversion electronics, which has a rated capacity of 100 kilowatts or less
and will be used primarily for on-site consumption.
§ 275-93 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-94

ARTICLE XV
River Corridor (RC) Smart Growth District
[Added 3-13-2012]
§ 275-101. Statutory authority.
§ 275-102. Intent.
This article is enacted by the Town of Bedford pursuant to RSA 674:21.
This innovative land use control ordinance shall provide for all
approvals, including the granting of conditional or special use permits,
by the Planning Board. Any decision made by the Planning Board under
this innovative land use control ordinance may b1e appealed directly
to Superior Court in the same manner provided by statute for appeals
from the Planning Board, as set forth in RSA 676:5, III, and RSA
677:15. A waiver process from particular requirements set forth in this
article may be employed by the Planning Board where the applicant
demonstrates substantial compliance with the standards set forth in
Article VIII, § 275-58, Purpose, Subsections A through E; provided,
however, that said Subsection D is hereby modified to obligate the
applicant to mitigate traffic impacts, not minimize them.
A.
The applicant shall have the option of applying for plan approval
pursuant to the zoning controls set forth in this article or complying
with all applicable zoning controls set forth in the zoning ordinances
of the Town of Bedford for the underlying district or for other overlay
zoning that may be therein defined. Smart Growth development
projects proceeding under this article shall be governed solely by the
provisions of this article and the RC Projects Design Review Guidelines
and shall be deemed exempt from all other standards and/or
procedures of the underlying zoning district and other overlay
provisions.
B.
The Town of Bedford (the "Town") recognizes that:
Land is a nonrenewable resource, and it and other natural
resources of this planet are limited, and parcels of land within
the Performance Zoning District (the "Performance Zone") which
have no development have diminished, and there is potential for
redevelopment and further development of currently developed
parcels;
(1)
Many societal needs, particularly those of senior citizens and young
adults, may be best served by zoning which will vary from most
current types of real estate development which, in conformance
with currently conventional zoning ordinances, excessively
separate land uses and result in the requirement of vehicular
travel;
(2)
A.
§ 275-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-102
1:411
It should promote forms of development which facilitate the
provision and maintenance of adequate public services and
infrastructure;
(3)
It should promote forms of development which facilitate all modes
of transportation (including foot traffic) and which regulate the
design of public space -- streets, squares, plazas, greens, parks --
for the use and enjoyment of its citizens;
(4)
It should seek to ensure an adequate supply of housing which is
affordable to households of all income levels;
(5)
It should promote forms of development which foster a strong
sense of community identity based on a shared, coherent,
functionally efficient physical environment and a shared economic,
legal, political, social, and cultural environment;
(6)
It should adopt policies and ordinances designed to alleviate traffic
congestion, conserve energy, provide an alternative means of
developing land and otherwise promote public health, safety, and
welfare; and
(7)
It adopted the following goals and objectives, among others, in the
adoption of the 2010 Master Plan:
Encourage innovative, higher density mixed-use development
and redevelopment in the South River Road, U.S. Route 3, area
(the "River Corridor");
(a)
Promote growth that is environmentally sustainable and
capable of withstanding economic downturns;
(b)
Support and stabilize the existing businesses and employment
base to the greatest extent possible;
(c)
Ensure that the remaining vacant land and redevelopment
along the River Corridor is utilized to the highest and best use
for achieving the Town's economic objectives;
(d)
Encourage higher density, innovative mixed-use development
along the River Corridor that creates housing opportunities
for all age groups and all income levels, in combination with
nonresidential uses, in order to promote efficient land use;
(e)
Encourage higher density of existing commercial areas, and
the potential for innovative mixed use, along the River
Corridor. Develop a strategy for improving the mix of
businesses and residences along the River Corridor to better
serve the needs of the community; and
(f)
Maintain the New England-style architectural character of
uses along this corridor and improve pedestrian, bicycle and
vehicular access.
(g)
(8)
§ 275-102 BEDFORD CODE § 275-102
1:412
The Town further recognizes that many American cities and towns
established between 1690 and 1940 continue to be desirable places
for today's population to live, work, shop and recreate. Such places,
developed prior to the intensive use of the automobile and the creation
of the interstate highway system, accommodate pedestrians as well as
vehicles within their built-up fabric. Essential characteristics of these
traditional neighborhoods include:
Dwellings, shops, and workplaces generally located in close
proximity to each other;
(1)
Appropriately sized buildings fronting on, and aligned with, streets
in a disciplined manner, generally uninterrupted by parking lots;
(2)
Generally regular geometric patterns of streets and blocks
arranged to provide comprehensible and interesting routes of
travel;
(3)
A hierarchy of streets, some narrow and convenient for a balanced
mix of both pedestrians and automobiles, while others wider to
carry greater traffic and perhaps serve as the major ceremonial
avenue, boulevard, or commercial main street;
(4)
Well configured squares, greens, gardens and parks woven into
street and block patterns and dedicated to collective social activity,
recreation and visual enjoyment;
(5)
A recognizable, functionally diverse, visually unified neighborhood
or town center, often focused on a major civic space such as a
village green or square, frequently also linked to a traditionally
important crossroads or waterfront; and
(6)
A built-up neighborhood area with an overall size small enough
to permit residents and workers, if they so choose, to walk or
ride bicycles comfortably rather than being required to drive
throughout much of the neighborhood.
(7)
B.
The Town recognizes, for the purposes of this section of the Zoning
Ordinance, the desirability of promoting an ordinance and a review
process designed to recognize all of that cited above and to explicitly
promote:
A reduction in the number and length of automobile trips and,
consequently, traffic congestion, within the River Corridor Smart
Growth District (the "RC Smart Growth District");
(1)
Increased pedestrian travel to increase citizen security, interaction,
neighborliness, and community bonding;
(2)
The physical and social integration of citizens diverse in age,
lifestyle and economic status;
(3)
C.
§ 275-102 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 275-102
1:413
§ 275-103. Purposes.
The purposes of the RC Smart Growth District are:
A diversity in types of housing, shopping, commercial trade, civic
facilities, recreation and employment; and
(4)
The orderly patterns of streets and blocks, subdivision lots, open
space, automobile parking, pedestrian pathways, building mass
and height and lot occupancy, based partly on the natural site
conditions of the RC Smart Growth District as well as the existing
constructed conditions adjacent to the RC Smart Growth District.
(5)
It is additionally intended that this section of the Zoning Ordinance
will allow for and encourage the expansion of opportunities for the
development of land in the Town consistent with the goals and
objectives of the adopted Master Plan and other requirements of law.
D.
This section of the RC Smart Growth District shall be construed as the
constitution of the RC Smart Growth District, and any interpretation
of the RC Smart Growth District shall be made in accordance with the
principles cited herein.
E.
To provide an opportunity for higher density commercial development,
to permit residential development together with commercial
development and to especially encourage mixed-use development,
including both new construction and renovation of existing buildings,
within a distinctive, attractive and livable environment that supports
the commercial revitalization of the River Corridor.
A.
To promote continuing development and redevelopment in the River
Corridor that is pedestrian friendly and consistent with the Town's
history and architecture.
B.
To ensure high quality site planning, architecture and landscape design
that enhances the distinct visual character and identity of the River
Corridor and provides an environment with safety, convenience and
amenity.
C.
To provide for a diversified housing stock at a variety of costs within
walking distance of services and public transportation, including
workforce housing and other housing types that meet the needs of the
Town's population.
D.
To generate positive tax revenue for the Town, while providing the
opportunity for new business growth and additional local jobs.
E.
To encourage preservation and rehabilitation of historic structures and
buildings.
F.
To promote efficient use of land and existing parking supply and limit
expansion within the district by encouraging shared parking.

Signs.
The sign standards of the Performance Zoning District
(§ 275-68) shall apply to the RC Smart Growth District. The
provision of kiosks, or other directional/informational clusters
of signs, with each sign of 1.5 square feet or less and which
pertains exclusively to lots within the RC Smart Growth
District is encouraged. These kiosks, where provided, shall
generally be located on civic lots and in other areas designed
for pedestrian gatherings.
(a)
No internally illuminated, flashing, moving or portable signs
are permitted within the RC Smart Growth District.
(b)
(4)
Property ownership and control within RC projects may include fee
simple lots; condominiums; and zero-lot lines, as well as portions of
buildings in fee simple, buildings apart from the land they are on and
leaseholds involving buildings, structures and land. Boundaries will
therefore include interior and exterior building walls, ceilings, roofs,
and conventional lot lines. "Lots," however, in a more conventional
sense, are not intended to be a large part of any RC project, as it is
the configuration of the streets and blocks formed by streets and the
placement of the buildings that determine the character of each RC
project.
A.
For the above reasons, lots may have almost any configuration, as is
described in more detail in the RC Projects Design Review Guidelines;
provided, however, that lot lines shall be regularly configured in logical
arrangements related to the RC project, or portion thereof, as they
relate to. Lot lines may not be designed to subvert the intents of this
article, for example, by creating "flag" lots in an attempt to separate
commercial from adjacent non-RC project residential property.
B.
No less than 50% of the perimeter of an open space area lot shall abut
either a street or an active pedestrian way.
C.
Applications for plan approval shall be governed by this section and the
RC Projects Design Review Guidelines.
Minimum lot area None

Impervious coverage. Impervious coverage shall not exceed 75% for the
entire RC Smart Growth Development District. Individual lots within
the RC Smart Growth development project may exceed 75%. Individual
RC projects may satisfy this requirement by permanent dedication
to pervious cover of sufficient other land in the district to meet the
seventy-five-percent criterion.
E.
Subdivision. Existing lots located in the RC Smart Growth District may
be subdivided and adjusted to form all or a part of a RC project.
F.
Building height. All building heights shall be subject to applicable
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements. A maximum
building height of 100 feet is allowed for projects in excess of six acres
as an incentive bonus for developments which include a workforce or
housing component, provided that the Fire Department agrees it has
the apparatus necessary to adequately respond to emergencies in a

§ 275-110. Street types and uses.
building of the height proposed or the applicant agrees to supply the
necessary apparatus at his or her cost.
Location of main entrances. The primary building entrances for
commercial establishments shall generally open to the front sidewalk.
B.
Civic/community buildings. Buildings located in civic use areas shall
be located adjacent to village greens, parks, squares or at a vista
termination.
C.
Waterfront development.
No buildings may be placed within 125 feet of the mean high
water line of the Merrimack River, unless an active pedestrian way
is provided across the lot on which the private building is sited
between the building and the river; and at least 35% of the length
of said active pedestrian way provides direct access to the river.
(1)
No private lot may extend to within 100 feet of the mean high water
line of the Merrimack River unless an active pedestrian way is
provided across the lot, between the lot and the river; and at least
35% of the length of said active pedestrian way provides direct
access to the river.
(2)
For the purposes of this section, "direct access to the river" is
provided if no buildings or non-water-dependent structures lie
between the active pedestrian way and the river.
(3)
D.
Building codes. All buildings and structures within the RC Smart
Growth District shall comply with all applicable Town, state and federal
building and safety codes as may be adopted by the Town or as may
otherwise be in effect in the Town.
E.
Streets shall be designed to ensure the safety of motorists and
pedestrians and shall generally:
Improve the view of and the view from buildings and other
prominent vistas;
(1)
(2) Minimize the area devoted to motor vehicle traffic;
Promote active pedestrian way design so that it is generally more
convenient and pleasant for most of the community to walk short
distances than to drive;
(3)
(4) Promote the creation of vista terminations;
Provide for connection of streets within a lot to abutting lots so that
each of the lots within the RC Smart Growth District will provide
continuous pedestrian and vehicular flow of traffic on foot and by
vehicle, bicycle and other means without reliance on Route 3; and
(5)
A.
§ 275-109 BEDFORD CODE § 275-110
1:422
Create safe vehicular and pedestrian passage within the RC Smart
Growth District.
(6)
Identification. The applicant shall depict on the plan which street
sections are proposed for all thoroughfares as a part of the Preliminary
Hearing Phase of the plan review.
B.
Property lines coincident with right-of-way. All property lines of each
lot shall be coincident with the public right-of-way for that street which
serves as primary access to the lot.
C.
Sidewalk sizes and requirements. Sidewalks at least 10 feet in width
shall be provided adjacent to all commercial uses, and sidewalks no less
than five feet in width shall generally be provided along one or both
sides of all streets within the RC Smart Growth District. Sidewalks shall
generally be parallel with the streets they adjoin and may be either
within the street right-of-way or within an individual lot. The sidewalk's
use and maintenance shall be ensured by permanent easement. In the
event of mixed commercial/residential uses within 150 feet of each
other, the commercial sidewalk standard width of 10 feet shall control.
D.
Lighting. Streetlights shall be provided along all active pedestrian ways
at not less than one-hundred-foot intervals.
E.
Crossings. Street and active pedestrian way design shall be done to
minimize pedestrian crossings at through streets.
F.
Access. Lot layout and active pedestrian ways shall be designed to
ensure pedestrian access to all lots.
G.
Street sections. Street sections proposed for use within the RC Smart
Growth District shall be a part of the RC Projects Design Review
Guidelines. Street sections are intended to provide the Planning Board
with sufficient detailed information in both plan and cross section view
to enable the Planning Board to determine how parked and moving
vehicles will interact with each other and with pedestrians, bicyclists
and other users of the street so that the safety of the street section may
be evaluated. The file of street sections may be added to from time to
time either by the Planning Board or by parties submitting new street
sections for review and approval by the Planning Board. The primary
review criteria of the street sections shall be based upon the intent and
purposes of the RC Smart Growth District.
H.
Layout. The maximum perimeter of any block formed by streets is 1,800
feet. The minimum perimeter of any block formed by streets is 600 feet.
Perimeters of blocks formed by streets are encouraged to be in the
range of 800 to 1,500 feet. Street layouts shall be generally rectilinear
with "deformations" as may be physically proper to adapt streets to
topographic or other natural conditions and to generally ensure vista
terminations at street intersections.

§ 275-111. Parking requirements.
§ 275-112. Utility requirements.
Construction requirements. Streets constructed within all RC projects
shall be constructed in accordance with the structural aspects of the
Bedford Road Standards in effect at the time of construction. This
provision specifically shall not, however, apply to any horizontal
dimension of any part of a street in a RC project.
J.
All parking requirements and guidelines are contained in the RC
Projects Design Review Guidelines. In general, parking both on street
and off street is to be treated as a shared resource in the RC Smart
Growth District. A goal is to achieve mixed-use "park-once" areas where
multiple destinations are served by parking once. The reverse, or
conventional development, provides parking for each use at each use,
thereby generating more traffic, more paved areas and an aesthetically
less pleasing walking environment. Both are schematically diagrammed
below.
A.
Snow emergency. The master developer shall provide a snow
emergency plan for the Planning Board's review and consideration
prior to final approval of a RC project. The snow emergency plan shall
show where vehicles will be stored during snow emergency periods;
how and by what methods snow will be removed from the streets and
sidewalks; and generally how the development project will function
during and after a snowstorm. The snow emergency plan shall not
require the Town to remove snow from private streets, sidewalks or
other private property, unless prior responsibility therefor has been
assumed by the Town.
B.
Utilities and location. All utilities shall be located underground where
permitted by applicable codes and shall also generally be located within
street rights-of-way or within alleys. All utility outlets, service
entrances, transformers and the like shall generally be clustered in
a neat and orderly fashion and shall be screened from view where
permitted by building and electrical codes.
A.
§ 275-110 BEDFORD CODE § 275-112
1:424
§ 275-113. Compliance required.
Local standards. All RC projects shall comply with all applicable provisions
of this article, the Land Development Control Regulations, the RC Projects
Design Review Guidelines and other pertinent ordinances, regulations and
policies of the Town; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict
between such ordinances, regulations or policies, the provisions of the RC
Smart Growth District and RC Projects Design Review Guidelines shall
control.

§ 275-115. Procedures and submission requirements.
Local, state and federal standards. Water and sewerage facilities shall
be designed and installed in accordance with applicable Town, state
and federal standards.
B.
Property owners' association(s).
Membership in a property owners' association (POA) or
associations established by a master developer shall be required
for all property owners within the RC Smart Growth Development
and shall be made a required covenant in all deeds issued or
passed.
(1)
The master developer shall prepare POA documents for the POA(s).
POA documents shall provide, at a minimum, that the POA shall
accept title to any open space areas which may be deeded by
the master developer to the POA, and shall provide for the
maintenance of any common area improvements, private streets,
private sidewalks, rights-of-way, utilities and open space areas
owned by the POA. The POA documents shall provide voting and
use rights, shall provide the POA with the authority to acquire a
lien upon the property of any of its members in order to secure
collection of any amounts due to the POA from its members, and
may also provide for the charge of dues, levies or assessments to
cover expenses which include, but are not limited to, tax liabilities,
maintenance and municipal or state assessments.
(2)
Any open space area may be deemed desirable to the Town or other
governmental agency during the approvals process. Any such area
will be so designated on the plan of the RC project and will be
offered to the Town or governmental agency for up to five years
from the approval of the RC project. Any such area not transferred
to a governmental entity shall then be transferred to the POA
initially designed by the master developer to receive ownership of
such open space area in the association documents.

§ 275-116. Applicable Performance Zoning District provisions.
To the extent not otherwise provided in this River Corridor Smart Growth
District Zoning, the provisions of the Performance Zoning District set forth
in Article VIII of the Town of Bedford Zoning Ordinances shall apply.
§ 275-117. When effective.
This River Corridor Smart Growth District Zoning shall not be effective
until the RC Projects Design Review Guidelines have been adopted by the
Planning Board.
Design Standards and Guidelines shall apply to this district unless
otherwise noted within this section or modified by approval of the
Planning Board.
The Planning Board may adopt review procedures and submission
requirements for the RC Smart Growth District which differ from those
for other subdivision and site plan criteria. No application for the
RC Smart Growth District submitted to the Planning Board will be
considered "complete," as defined by statute (RSA 676:4), until the
Planning Board either adopts such RC Smart Growth District specific
criteria or until a period of 120 days has elapsed from the effective date
of the ordinance, whichever first occurs.
B.
Due to the unique nature of this district and its intent and purposes,
the Planning Board may consider an application for a RC project that
alone does not comport with the requirements herein but which may
otherwise qualify if other properties are effectively connected through
reciprocal cross easements or otherwise legally connected to create
areas that together satisfy the requirements, intent and purposes
herein.

Plans and all elevations, drawn to scale, showing the architectural
features of the proposed new building, addition or alteration as
well as the relationship of the new work to any existing structure;
drawings to call out the exterior finish materials, dimensions and
accurately depict doors, windows, rooflines, exterior lighting and
fixtures and other architectural features and elements.
