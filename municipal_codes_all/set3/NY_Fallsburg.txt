DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Officers and employees  See Ch. 48.
§ 7-1. Legislative intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to confer the benefits of § 18 of the Public
Officers Law and provide legal and financial protection for those individuals
serving the Town of Fallsburg from losses which may result from legal
actions which may be brought against them in their individual capacity
for actions taken while in the performance of their official duties and
responsibilities. In enacting this chapter, the Town Board finds that other
towns in the State of New York have enacted similar provisions for the
legal and financial security of their officers and employees and further
finds that such security is also required for Town of Fallsburg personnel.
By enactment of this chapter, the Town Board does not intend to limit
or otherwise abrogate any existing right or responsibility of the Town of
Fallsburg or its employees with regard to indemnification or legal defense.
It is solely the intent of this chapter to provide similar coverage for local
employees as is presently provided for employees of other towns, so as to
continue to attract qualified individuals to local government service.
§ 7-2. Definitions.
As used herein, the following words shall have the meanings below set
forth:

employment in the service of the Town, but shall not include an independent
contractor. The term "employee" shall include a former employee, his or her
estate or judicially appointed personal representative.
TOWN  The Town of Fallsburg.
§ 7-3. Provisions for defense and indemnification by Town.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 7-8 of this

civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any
alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to
have occurred while the employee was acting or, in good faith,
§ 1-16 FALLSBURG CODE § 7-3
1:16
purporting to act within the scope of his or her public employment or
duties. Such defense shall not be provided where such civil action or
proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the Town. The Town shall
indemnify and save harmless its employees in the amount of any
judgment obtained against such employee, or in the amount of any
settlement of a claim, provided that the act or omission from which such
judgment or claim arose occurred while the employee was acting or,
in good faith, purporting to act within the scope of his or her public
employment or duties; provided further that in the case of a settlement
the duty to indemnify and save harmless shall be conditioned upon the
approval of the amount of settlement by the Town Board.
(1) The Town shall make a determination of whether the employee was
acting or, in good faith, purporting to act within the scope of his or
her employment or duties, as soon as practicable after presentation
of suit. Such determination shall be made after a full investigation
into the allegations of the complaint by the Town's attorney, with
the assistance of such other individuals as may be reasonably
necessary. If the Town determines that the employee was not acting
within the scope of his or her employment or duties, the Town shall
bear no legal expense on behalf of such employee, nor shall it
indemnify the employee for any judgment obtained against him or
her; further, if, after an initial determination that the employee was
acting within the scope of his or her employment, the Town
determines that the employee has misled the Town or has
otherwise acted in bad faith during the pendency of the action or
proceeding and the Town determines that the employee was not, in
fact, acting or purporting to act within the scope of his or her
employment or duties, the Town shall bear no legal expense on
behalf of such employee, nor shall it indemnify the employee for
any judgment obtained against him or her.
(2) In accordance with the provisions of § 50-j, Subdivision 6, of the
General Municipal Law, the Town shall provide for the defense of
any civil action or proceeding brought against a duly appointed
police officer of the Town and shall indemnify and save harmless
such police officer from any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction whenever such action, proceeding or judgment is for
punitive or exemplary damages arising out of a negligent act or
other tort of such police officer committed while in the proper
discharge of his duties and within the scope of his or her
employment. The determination of whether any such police officer
properly discharged his or her duties within the scope of his or her
employment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection A(1) of this section.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in this chapter, the employee shall be
represented by the Town's attorney or an attorney employed or retained
by the Town for the defense of the employee. The Town Board shall
employ or retain an attorney for the defense of the employee whenever

§ 7-4. Limitation of applicability.

any provision of this chapter be construed to affect, alter or repeal any
provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 7-5. Extension of benefits to certain employees limited.
The benefits of this chapter shall be extended to an employee of a
negotiating unit for which an agreement has been negotiated pursuant to
Civil Service Law Article 14 only if such agreement expressly so provides.
§ 7-6. Effect on insurers.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.
§ 7-7. Construal of provisions.
As otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, the provisions of this
chapter shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit, modify,
abrogate or restrict any immunity available to or conferred upon any unit,
entity, officer or employee of the Town or any right to defense provided for
the Town does not have an attorney or the Town Board determines,
based upon its investigation and review of the facts and circumstances
of the case, that representation by the Town's attorney would be
inappropriate or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a
conflict of interest exists and that the employee cannot be represented
by the Town's attorney. Reasonable attorney's fees and litigation
expenses shall be paid by the Town to such attorney employed or
retained from time to time during the pendency of the civil action or
proceeding, subject to certification by the Town Supervisor that the
employee is entitled to representation under the terms and conditions
of this chapter. Payment of such fees and expenses shall be made in the
same manner as payment of other claims and expenses of the Town.
Any dispute with respect to representation of multiple employees by
the Town's attorney or by an attorney employed or retained for such
purposes or with respect to the amount of the fees or expenses shall be
resolved by the court.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Town Supervisor as required by § 7-8 of this chapter, the Supervisor
shall take the necessary steps, including the retention of an attorney
under the terms and conditions provided in § 7-3B of this chapter, on
behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment, pending
resolution of any question relating to the obligation of the Town to
provide a defense.

Alternate Members

time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 59-5. Title.
This article shall be a new article of the Code of the Town of Fallsburg
entitled "Alternate Members of Zoning Board of Appeals and Planning
Board."
§ 59-6. Statutory authority.
This article is enacted pursuant to the provisions of Municipal Home Rule
Law § 10 and Town Law §§ 267(11) and 271(15).
§ 59-7. Purpose and findings.
§ 59-8. Alternate appointments for Zoning Board of Appeals.
A. The intention of this article is to establish alternate members of the
Zoning Board of Appeals and the Planning Board of the Town of
Fallsburg pursuant to Town Law §§ 267(11) and 271(15) and further to

Law §§ 267(11) and 271(15). Neither § 267 nor § 271 of the Town Law,
governing zoning and planning, contain any express prohibition against
the adoption of a local law to provide for an expansion of the conditions
under which alternate members of said Boards may serve.
B. The need for this article arises not only out of conflicts of interest which
may require a member of said Boards to recuse themselves, but also to
provide a working majority for purposes of voting on various issues and
applications where a quorum is not present due to illness or absence of
members of said Boards for any reason. It is the intention of this article
to assist both the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Planning Board, as well
as applicants appearing before said Boards to proceed with the
applications brought before said Boards in an efficient and timely
manner.
A. Pursuant to Town Law § 267(11), the Town Board hereby establishes
and authorizes the appointment of not more than three alternate

delegated power of municipal boards to impose disciplinary measures on

informing them of the Chief's determination. The Chief shall provide a copy
of the Chief's decision to the Town Board. Upon the issuance of the Chief's

Within 14 days of the member receiving the Chief's decision that imposition
of a disciplinary penalty is required, the member may request a hearing on
the charges by having a written demand for a hearing served upon the Town
Supervisor. Within 45 days of the Town Supervisor's receipt of a member's
written demand for a hearing, the Town Board shall do one of the following:
§ 62-8. Recommended decision; final determination.
The hearing officer or Town Board member selected to hear and determine
the charges shall conduct a hearing and shall issue a decision containing
findings of fact and a recommended disciplinary penalty, if applicable, to
the Town Board. Said decision shall be reviewed by the Town Board, and,
after its review, the Town Board may accept or reject, in whole or in part,
the recommended findings of fact and/or the recommended disciplinary
penalty, if applicable. The Town Board shall make the final determination of
the charges alleged in the notice of discipline and, where applicable, shall
impose any penalty consistent with the provisions of the New York State
Town Law, or any other penalty agreed to between the Town Board and the
respondent member.
§ 62-9. Appeal.
In accord with Town Law § 155, the determination of the Town Board shall
be subject to review by the Supreme Court in the judicial district in which
the Town is located in the manner provided for by Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules, provided that the proceeding is commenced within
30 days from the date of the Town Board's determination.
§ 62-10. Due process; representation.
Any member that is served with a notice of discipline may have a
representative or legal counsel represent him or her in connection with
any proceedings provided for by this article. The hearing of the charges
alleged in the notice of discipline shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of Town Law § 155, and such hearing shall be transcribed by a
stenographer. A copy of the transcript of the proceedings shall be provided
to the member free of charge.

ARTICLE I
Recreation Land Fees
[Adopted 2-24-2004 by L.L. No. 1-200442]
§ 135-1. Legislative findings; statutory authority; effect on other
laws.
The Town Board of the Town of Fallsburg hereby finds that there is a present
need for expansion of park and recreational facilities in the Town, based
on projected population growth to which all residential subdivisions and
residential site plans will contribute. The Town Board has determined that
a unified system of parks and recreational facilities located to meet the
needs of the residents of the entire Town is desirable. Therefore, the Town
Board determines that it is a proper case that each residential subdivision
and residential site plan contribute recreational fees calculated on lots or
dwelling unit count resulting from new subdivisions and site plans. The
Town Board determines that the provisions of this article are consistent with
the purposes of Town Law §§ 277(4) and 274-a.6 and that to the extent, if
any, that this article may hereinafter be determined to be inconsistent, this
article shall, as provided in Article IX of the New York State Constitution
and the Municipal Home Rule Law, supersede such provisions in reference
to the Town of Fallsburg.
§ 135-2. Imposition of fee in lieu of recreation land.
There is hereby imposed a one-time fee to be assessed upon real property
in the Town of Fallsburg on which new residential building construction
is proposed, when such construction will result from subdivisions and site
plans (including condo units, co-ops, etc.) hereinafter approved. Such fees
shall be levied and collected in accordance with this article. Such fees shall
be called "recreation fees." The obligation to pay such fees shall be a lien
against the property, which shall contain the new construction as of the
time of approval and shall be satisfied as hereinafter provided. All monies
collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a trust fund to be
used by the Town exclusively for park, playground or other recreational
purposes, including the acquisition of property within the Town of Fallsburg
for such purposes. For purposes of this article, a fee schedule has been
established as set forth hereinafter. The Town of Fallsburg may, from time
to time, vary the amount of such fees by resolution of the Town Board.
§ 135-3. Collection of fees. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. IV)]
The fees shall be due and paid before the signing of the subdivision or site
plan by the Planning Board. No Town official shall issue a building permit,
certificate of occupancy or other report concerning such property unless
such official has determined that the fees required hereby have been paid.
42.Editor's Note: This local law also provided that it shall apply to any project, residential
site plan or subdivision approved by the Planning Board after 3-10-2004.
§ 135-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-4
1:139
§ 135-4. Exemptions.
§ 135-5. Fees not waived by failure to collect.
The neglect or failure of the Town to collect such recreational fees at the
time when such fees are due shall not waive the Town's right to collect such
fees.
§ 135-6. Notice of assessment levied.
In the event the Town Board determines such fees are due and owing but
have not been paid, the Town Boad shall, after notice to the property owner
and the provision of an opportunity to be heard, assess such recreational
fees, together with interst and costs related to such assessment, against
such real property. Notice by certified mail to the address shown on the
Town's latest assessment roll at least 10 days prior to the date of the
hearing shall be deemed good and sufficient notice. Such assessment shall
be levied on the annual state, county and Town real property tax bill.

Water and Sewer Development Fees
[Adopted 5-11-2004 by L.L. No. 2-2004]
§ 135-8. Legislative findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Fallsburg is aware that there has been a
substantial increase in subdivisions and site plans submitted to the Town
of Fallsburg Planning Board and that projections indicate that same will
continue based on a projected population growth in the Town of Fallsburg
over the next number of years. This increased growth will increase the
demand for water services and wastewater disposal services and will
directly impact the existing wastewater disposal system and water supply
facilities operated by the Town of Fallsburg which will necessitate the
expansion thereof and increase the necessity to repair and maintain same.
In order to equitably distribute the monies needed for such expansion,
repair and maintenance, new developments should contribute their fair
share of the cost of providing said facilities for wastewater disposal and
water service.
§ 135-9. Imposition of fee. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. IV)]
There is hereby imposed a one-time fee to be assessed on the real property
in the Town of Fallsburg on which new construction is proposed when such
construction results from subdivision or site plan approval by the Town of
Fallsburg Planning Board. Such fees will be called "water development fee"
or "sewer development fee," as the case may be. The fee will be due and
payable by the property owner and shall be a lien against the real property
until paid. All subdivisions and site plans approved by the Town of Fallsburg
Planning Board on or after May 13, 2004, shall be subject to the payment
of the fees set forth herein. All monies collected pursuant to this article
shall be deposited in a fund to be used by the Town for expansion, repair
or maintenance of the sewage disposal system or water supply system of
the Town of Fallsburg, it being understood that all sums paid for water
development fees shall be used for the expansion, repair or maintenance
of the water supply system and all sums paid for sewer development fees
shall be used for the expansion, repair or maintenance of the sewerage
disposal system, including the acquisition of any property necessary for said
purposes.
§ 135-10. Rate of fees per unit. [Amended 6-24-2013 by L.L. No.
2-2013; 3-14-2016 by L.L. No. 2-2016]
A. For purposes of this article, the payment of development fees shall be
based on a gallon-per-day charge. The charge or fee is hereby
established as $0.86 per gallon per day for water development fee and
$2.81 per gallon for sewer development fee for in-district development,
and $5.26 per gallon per day for water development fee and $16.42 per
gallon per day for sewer development fee for out-of-district
§ 135-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 135-10
1:141
development. Whether a property is in-district or out-of-district shall
be established by the district lines as they will exist on May 13, 2004.
So, for example, if a subdivision is proposed whereby the subdivider
wishes to add a sewer or water extension district to an existing district,
those structures that are built on premises that on May 13, 2004, are
not part of the district will be considered an out-of-district structure for
purposes of this article. Further, the Town of Fallsburg may from time to
time change the amount of such fees by resolution of the Town Board.
B. Gallons per day for various uses have been established and tabulated
(Table I) and shall be utilized for the calculation of development fees.
C. The Town Engineer may use his/her discretion in calculating gallons per
day for uses not provided on Table I.
D. The Town reserves the right to collect fees in the event additional
homes or bedrooms are built beyond the approved.

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization; Purpose
§ 137-1. Findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Fallsburg finds that the potential and/
or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the
residents of the Town of Fallsburg and that such damages may include
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 137-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 137-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages;
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands, and;
F. Qualify and maintain for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
§ 137-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-3
1:151
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. To provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and,
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.

Definitions
§ 137-4. Definitions and word usage.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percentor-
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one
to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly
referred to as the base floodplain or one-hundred-year floodplain. For
purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor,
18 inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside
of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed
area, which may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must
be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed
crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the equalization
of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
§ 137-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-4
1:153
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building built, in the case
of a building in Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, to
have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zone
V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure
member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow
of the water, and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the
base flood. In the case of Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X,
or D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means
of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones
V1-V30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise
meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower
area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls that meet the federal
standards.
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY  The federal
agency that administers the National Flood Insurance Program.
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)  An official map
of the community published by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as part of a riverine community's Flood Insurance Study. The
FBFM delineates a regulatory floodway along watercourses studied in
detail in the Flood Insurance Study.
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY  An examination, evaluation and
determination of the flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding
water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and
determination of flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)  An official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been
designated as Zone A but no flood elevations are provided.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  An official map of a
community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY  See "flood elevation study."
FLOOD or FLOODING 
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(a) The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source.

of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water
exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied
by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a
flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual
and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in
Subsection B(1)(a) above.

the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including
a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or
footings, installation of pilings or construction of columns. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation (such as clearing,
excavation, grading, or filling), or the installation of streets or
walkways, or excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations,
or the erection of temporary forms, or the installation of accessory
buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units

The Code Enforcement Officer is hereby appointed local administrator to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain
development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 137-12. Floodplain development permit.
§ 137-13. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 137-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures;
fill; storage of materials; drainage facilities; and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee as set by resolution of the Town
Board. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing
the Town of Fallsburg for any additional costs necessary for review,
inspection and approval of this project. The local administrator may
require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover these additional costs.

relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 137-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 137-13, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
§ 137-13 FALLSBURG CODE § 137-14
1:162
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 137-15A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 137-13G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meets the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses.
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Administrator, Region II, Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.

(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search-and-rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 137-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-20

in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in

increases beyond the three acres, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases. [Amended 12-22-2014 by L.L. No.

B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:

minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
§ 137-20 FALLSBURG CODE § 137-21
1:174

the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Written notice.
(1) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 137-14H of this chapter.

In order to prevent blight and the spread thereof, it is hereby declared all
property in the Town of Fallsburg (the "Town"), improved or unimproved,
including, but not limited to residences, office buildings, shopping centers,
supermarkets, retail stores, discount houses, warehouses, manufacturing
or fabrication plants, factories, gasoline service stations, public garages,
motor vehicle repair shops or other business uses, whether occupied or
vacant, and accessory structures and unlicensed or junk vehicles located in
the Town of Fallsburg shall be maintained in conformity with the standards
set out in this chapter so as to assure that these structures and properties
will not adversely affect the neighborhood and the community at large. It is
found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive
deterioration, certain structures and properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, unhealthy, unsanitary
and unsafe conditions and that if same are not curtailed and removed, the
aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the
expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and/or eliminate.
By reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the
growth of slums and blight may be prevented and the neighborhood and
property values thereby maintained, the desirability and amenities of
residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhood enhanced and the
public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.

4-2015]
All tests, including site and soil appraisals (including percolation tests
and deep test pits), required by this § 230-10.1 shall be conducted by
a design professional who shall certify to the Town that the proposed
location and wastewater disposal system plan meet the requirements of
this article and the standards of applicable laws and regulations. All testing
for purposes of designing new and modified wastewater disposal systems
and qualifying new subdivision lots for placement of such systems therein
shall, at a minimum, meet New York State standards, as supplemented and
superseded by the following additional requirements:
(1) Any realty subdivision as defined by Article 11, Title 2, of the New
York State Public Health Law or Article 17, Title 15, of the New
York State Environmental Conservation Law;
(2) Any alternative system as defined by Appendix 75-A of Part 75 of
Title 10 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations (10 NYCRR
75-A.9);
(3) Any wastewater facility required to be permitted by the NYSDOH;
and
(4) Any wastewater disposal treatment system or other system with
effluent in excess of 1,000 gallons per day.
B. No permit shall be issued for any private wastewater disposal system
employing an alternative subsurface treatment system (as defined by
10 NYCRR 75-A.9) except after review and approval by the Town Board
pursuant to § 230-10.1C and G. No wastewater disposal system, except
where permitted pursuant to this chapter, shall be permitted to
discharge to any natural outlet.
A. Two percolation tests and a deep test pit shall be provided within at
least 60% of the proposed absorption field areas. Additionally, two
percolation tests and a deep test pit shall be conducted for at least 60%
of the replacement areas. The CEO, in his or her sole discretion, may
require more than the minimum percolation and/or deep test pits.
Locations of all tests shall be depicted on the plans for the on-site
individual wastewater treatment system and on each lot in connection
with subdivision plan. Each absorption area for a dwelling shall be sized
on the basis of the number of bedrooms anticipated. Where the number
of bedrooms is unknown, each dwelling unit shall be assumed to include
four bedrooms. All tests required by this chapter relating to a major
subdivision must be witnessed and certified by a design professional
and, if not so certified, then such tests shall not be relied upon by the
Planning Board in the subdivision review process.
B. Soils with percolation test results faster than five minutes per inch shall
not be used for absorption fields and seepage pits. The design
§ 230-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-10.1
1:277
professional shall, in such case, evaluate whether the soils can be
modified to meet state requirements.
C. Where percolation rates exceed 60 minutes per inch, a subsurface
disposal system shall not be allowed, except as may be granted by
formal waiver. An applicant subject to this subsection may apply to the
Town Board pursuant to § 230-10.1G(3) for a waiver to use an
alternative subsurface treatment system designed in accordance with
10 NYCRR Part 75, Appendix 75-A, as amended.
D. An additional 100% of the required absorption field area shall be
available for future expansion and replacement. Such area shall be
depicted on the plans for the wastewater disposal system and on each
lot in question.
E. Depth to the seasonal high groundwater shall be determined at the
location of each deep test pit from direct measurement, documenting
evidence of soil mottling and other characteristics. The source of the
data must be cited in the design professional's report.
F. The certified report of the design professional shall contain an estimate
of the average gradient of the groundwater table toward or away from
the nearest point of water use or the nearest surface water body such
as a stream, pond, lake or wetland in the vicinity of each deep test pit
location. An estimate shall also be made of the distance from the deep
test pit location to the nearest point of water use or nearest surface
water body. The certified report of the design professional shall address
the potential for groundwater quality degradation due to subsurface
wastewater disposal in the vicinity of the test pit locations. Where this
preliminary analysis indicates subsurface wastewater disposal at the
site has a moderate to high potential to cause groundwater quality
degradation, the CEO may require additional data to determine if the
site is suitable for subsurface sewage disposal. At a minimum, the
additional data, if required, shall consist of test borings, with detailed
boring logs, sufficient in number and location, as approved by the CEO,
to determine the gradient, thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the
shallowest saturated zone (aquifer) underlying the site. Based on the
above information, the applicant's design professional shall submit
dilution calculations of expected nitrate pollution at the property
boundary. On the basis of this additional data, the CEO may determine
the site is suitable, is suitable only with specific conditions, or that the
site does not appear to be suitable for subsurface wastewater disposal.
In the latter case, additional detailed modeling of groundwater flows
and pollutant dispersion may be submitted by the applicant in order to
demonstrate the site is appropriate for subsurface wastewater disposal
and such activity will not cause an unacceptable degradation in
groundwater quality.
G. The number of alternative subsurface treatment systems designed in
accordance with 10 NYCRR Part 75, Appendix 75-A, as amended, in the
aggregate, shall be limited as follows:

§ 230-27. Restrictions on discharge of certain wastes.
A. The following described substances, materials, waters or waste shall be
limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or
quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment
process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or
constitute a nuisance. The Superintendent may set limitations lower
than the limitations established in the regulations below if in his or her
opinion such more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above
objectives. In forming his or her opinion as to the acceptability, the
Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of
subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials
of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process
employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of
treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors.
B. The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste
or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be
violated without approval of the Superintendent are as follows:

to the receiving waters.
(10) Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form
suspended solids which interfere with the collection system, or
create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment
processes.
(11) Any substance which may cause the discharge from the POTW or
any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludge, or scums,
to be unsuitable for reclamation process where the POTW is
pursuing a reuse and reclamation program. In no case shall a
substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in
noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or
regulations affecting sludge use or disposal development pursuant
to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic
Substance Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge
management method being used. [Amended 5-18-2015 by L.L.

ARTICLE XI
Imposition and Computation
§ 230-59. Title.
This Part 3 shall be known and may be cited as the "Sewer Impact Fee Law
of the Town of Fallsburg, Sullivan County, New York."
§ 230-60. Findings and purpose.
A. Findings. The Town Board of the Town of Fallsburg makes the following
findings and conclusions:
(1) Projections indicate that the population of the Town of Fallsburg
will increase substantially during the next 20 years;
(2) The increase in population and the incidential demand for
wastewater services will directly and adversely impact the existing
wastewater treatment and disposal facilities as provided by the
Fallsburg Consolidated Sewer District;
(3) In order to accommodate this impact, the wastewater treatment
and disposal facilities of the Fallsburg Consolidated Sewer District
will have to be expanded;
(4) The existing wastewater treatment and disposal facilities of the
Fallsburg Consolidated Sewer District are not sufficient to
accommodate anticipated new development which is expected to
occur in the Town of Fallsburg;
(5) The Town of Fallsburg Comprehensive Plan provides that land
development be permitted only where adequate public facilities
exist, or can be provided to accommodate it;
(6) Existing revenue sources are not sufficient to fund capital
improvements necessary to accommodate new development;
(7) New development should contribute for its fair share of the costs of
providing new facilities necessary to accommodate such new
development;
(8) A thorough engineering study has been made to establish a method
for developing capital recovery and capital impact fees for
expanding wastewater treatment and disposal facilities;
(9) The capital recovery fee formula is to provide that new developers
shall pay their equal share of capital costs incurred;
§ 230-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-60
1:309
§ 230-61. Authority and supersession of Town Law.
Pursuant to §§ 10(1)(ii)(a)(9-a), (11) and (12) of the Municipal Home Rule
Law and § 10(6) of the Statute of Local Governments, the Town of Fallsburg
has authority to enact this Part 3; and, whereas, pursuant to Municipal
Home Rule Law § 10(1)(ii)(d)(3), the Town may supersede provisions of the
Town Law; § 277 of the Town Law, and any of the provisions of the Town
Law, to the extent that it is in conflict with this Part 3, is hereby superseded
and amended.
§ 230-62. Rules of construction.
(10) The capital impact fee formula is not established at a rate to
correct existing deficiencies;
(11) The capital impact fee formula as determined in this Part 3
establishes a fair and conservative method of assessing new
development for its fair share of costs;
(12) The capital recovery and impact fees will not fully pay for the costs
of wastewater treatment and disposal facilities necessary for new
development, and the Town recognizes that the shortfall will have
to come from other revenue sources; and
(13) Increasing the capacity of wastewater treatment and disposal
facilities in order to provide essential services is a recognized
responsibility of government and is in the best interest of public
health, safety and welfare.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this Part 3 is to assure that new development
does not overtax existing levels of service and that new development
bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditure necessary
to provide wastewater treatment and disposal services required to
mitigate the impacts of new growth in the Town of Fallsburg.
A. Liberal construction. The provisions of this Part 3 shall be liberally
construed so as to effectively carry out its purpose in the interest of the
public health, safety and welfare.
B. Generally. For the purposes of administration and enforcement, unless
otherwise stated, the following rules of construction shall apply to the
text of this Part 3:
(1) In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text of this Part 3 and any caption, illustration, summary table, or
illustrative table, the text shall control.
(2) The word "shall" is always mandatory and not discretionary; the
word "may" is permissive.

§ 234-8. Directional signs.
§ 234-9. On-premises signs.
A. Directional sign content shall be limited to the identification of the
activity, facility, attraction, area or site, an indication of the mileage
from the sign to the site, a route number or other needed directional
wording.
B. Directional signs shall be permitted in all zoning districts and shall be
no larger than four square feet in area.
A. A sign display or device will be considered an on-premises sign if it
meets the following requirements: The sign must be located on the
same premises as, and within 1,500 feet of the activity or property
advertised, and must have as its purpose the identification of the
activity, its products or services or the sale or lease of the property on
which the sign is located.
B. The following will not be considered to be a part of the premises on
which the activity is conducted and any signs located on such land will
be considered "off-premises" advertising:
(1) Any land which is not used as an integral part of the principal
activity. This would include but is not limited to land which is
separated from the activity by a roadway, highway or other
obstruction and not used by the activity and extensive undeveloped
highway frontage contiguous to the land actually used even though
it might be under the same ownership.
(2) Any land which is used for or devoted to a separate purpose
unrelated to the activity. For example, land adjacent to or adjoining
a service station but devoted to agriculture, residential or other
commercial or industrial use having no relation to the service
station premises even though under the same ownership.
(3) Land which is at some distance from the principal activity and is in
closer proximity to the highway than the sign site and occupied
solely by structures or uses which are only incidental to the
principal activity and would serve no integrated purpose related to
the activity other than to attempt to qualify the land for signing
purposes. Generally, these will be inexpensive facilities such as
picnic, playground or camping areas, golf-driving ranges, common
or private roadways or easements, walking paths, fences and
maintenance sheds.
(4) Where the sign site is located at or near the end of a narrow strip
contiguous to the advertised activity, the sign site shall not be
considered part of the premises on which the activity being
advertised is conducted. A narrow strip shall include any
configuration of land that cannot be put to any reasonable use
related to the activity other than for signing purposes.
§ 234-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234-9
1:323
§ 234-10. Signs in residential districts.
(5) In no event shall a sign site be considered part of the premises on
which the advertised activity is conducted if it is located upon a
strip which is not buildable such as swamp land, roadway or held
by easement or other wet land or which is a common or private
roadway or held by easement or other lesser interests than the
premises where the advertised activity is located.
C. When a sign brings rental income to the property owner and consists
principally of name or trade name advertising and the product or
service advertised is only incidental to the principal activity, it shall be
considered an off-premises sign. An example would be a billboard
located at a service station advertising a brand of cigarettes which is
incidentally sold in a vending machine on the property.
D. A sign which advertises activities conducted on the premises but which
also advertises in a prominent manner activities not conducted on the
premises is not an on-premises sign. An example would be a sign
advertising a motel or restaurant not located on the premises with a
notation indicating "skeet range here." The on-premises activity would
not only be the skeet range.
E. A sale or lease sign which also advertises any product or service not
located upon and unrelated to the business selling or leasing the land
on which the land is located is not an on-premises sign.
A. The following types of signs and no others shall be permitted in
residential districts:
(1) Signs advertising the sale or rental of the premises upon which
located, provided they do not exceed one per property and a total of
five square feet in area and are nonilluminated. [Amended
5-11-2010 by L.L. No. 7-2010]

area.

entrance of such development, provided that such signs do not
exceed one per street entrance and eight square feet in area.
(4) Signs identifying a school, house of worship or other institution not
exceeding one per street frontage and 12 square feet in area.
(5) Small announcement signs designating professional offices or
home occupations, provided the sign area does not exceed two
square feet. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1,
General Provisions, Art. IV)]
B. Signs in residential areas shall have letters and numbers which do not
exceed three inches in height.

agricultural districts:

L.L. No. 1-2013]
The following types of signs and no other shall be permitted in commercial
districts:
C. Nonilluminated and illuminated nonflashing signs are allowed.
D. One sign per dwelling unit shall be permitted, except in the case of
corner lots where two signs (one facing each street) shall be permitted
per dwelling unit.
A. Signs advertising a sale or rental of the premises on which they are
located, provided they do not exceed one per property, six square feet in
area.
B. Signs advertising a business or trade or identifying a location of a trade,
provided they do not exceed two per property. Each sign may be no
more than six square feet in area.

square feet in area,

such sign is located are prohibited.

located are prohibited. This shall not apply to directional signs, which
shall be limited to four square feet in area.
D. General directory signs shall be no larger than 40 square feet in area
and shall include only the names of the establishments in letters no
higher than five inches. Such signs shall only be permitted upon special
approval by the Architectural Review Board which shall encourage
uniform directory signs.
E. There shall be no more than one sign for each tenant on the premises on
each wall fronting a street. The aggregate area in square feet of all
signs on any wall shall be no greater than two times the length in feet of
such wall.

A. In the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this chapter, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the owner of the premises, in
writing, to remove, repair or bring the sign into conformance, within 30
days of the date of such notice.
B. Any person, firm or corporation, whether as owner, lessee agent or
employee, who violates any of the provisions of this chapter, or who fails
to comply with any order or regulation made thereunder, or who erects,
moves or alters any sign in violation of any detailed statement or plans
submitted by him and approved under the provisions of this chapter,
shall be guilty of a violation as the same is defined in the Penal Law and
shall be fined not more than $250 for each violation. [Amended

C. Each day that such violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a

Road Cuts
[Adopted 8-13-2012 by L.L. No. 8-2012]
§ 257-15. Permit required. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. IV)]
A permit shall be required for any and all road cut work to be conducted. A
road cut permit shall be available upon application at the Town of Fallsburg
Highway Department or the Town of Fallsburg Water/Sewer Department.
The permit application fee/road cut bond shall be as set by resolution of
the Town Board. A portion of the fee shall be nonrefundable; the remaining
portion shall be refundable if the Town Engineer has approved the
restoration of the roadway.
§ 257-16. Holding of bond.
The Town of Fallsburg reserves the right to hold the refundable portion for a
period of two years from the date of restoration. The purpose of holding the
road cut bond for this length of time is to allow evaluation of settlement or
pothole conditions within the restored portion of roadway. The vast majority
of the time, it takes about one year for any flaws to appear and two years
for the road to completely reveal any imperfections in the restored area.
§ 257-17. Periodic inspection; repair.
After the road work area has been restored, the contractor will be
responsible for periodically inspecting the cut site and assuring the area is
properly maintained. This should especially be done after heavy rainfall, ice
treatment and snow removal. If the Town discovers problems in the restored
area, the Town will notify the contractor and the contractor must repair the
section within a reasonable period of time. If the repairs are not completed,
the Town will proceed to make any necessary repairs and deduct the cost
from the refundable portion of the original bond based on $20 per square
foot.
§ 257-18. Bond refund.
At the completion of the two-year period, it is the contractor's responsibility
to request the bond refund from the Town. Upon final inspection and
approval of the road cut area by the Highway Superintendent and Town
Engineer, a claim voucher will be filled out through the Town Engineer's
Office, signed by the Highway Superintendent and submitted to the
Accounting Department for payment. The refund will represent either the
full amount of $1,900 or the balance remaining after deducting any costs
the Town incurred to affect necessary repair(s). Supporting Town repair
documents will be copied and filed in the Town Engineer's Office.

A. Preapplication procedure.
(1) Previous to the filing of an application for approval of a preliminary
plat, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Board a sketch
plan and data as specified in § 260-6. This step does not require
formal application fee or filing of plan with the Planning Board.
(2) Within 30 days, the Planning Board shall inform the subdivider that
the sketch plan and data as submitted, or as modified, do or do not
meet the objectives of these regulations and it shall express its
reasons therefor.
§ 260-2 FALLSBURG CODE § 260-3
1:360
(3) When the subdivider has been notified that the sketch plan has met
the objectives, he shall then consult the New York State
Department of Health and Water Resources Commission if his
proposed subdivision is five or more lots. If the subdivision is
located within 500 feet of a municipal boundary at any point, it
shall be referred to the County Planning Board for coordination.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. IV)]
(4) If the subdivision is to utilize a form of subsurface leaching, the
subdivision engineer should prepare the preliminary plat only after
an inspection and percolation tests have been made of the property
in accordance with the requirements of the New York State
Department of Health.
(5) If the installation of a public sewer system is involved, the
subdivider shall consult with the New York State Department of
Health and the Town Board and prepare the preliminary plat in
accordance with their requirements.
B. Preliminary plat procedure.
(1) On reaching conclusions informally as recommended in this section
above, regarding his general program and objectives, the
subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together
with improvement plans and other supplementary material as
specified in §§ 260-4 and 260-6.
(2) Two copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material
specified shall be submitted to the Planning Board with two copies
of the application for conditional approval at least 14 days prior to
the meeting at which it is to be considered.
(3) Following review of the preliminary plat and other material
submitted for conformity thereof to these regulations, and
negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and
the kind and extent of improvements to be made by him, the
Planning Board, shall, within 62 days, act thereon as submitted or
modified, and if approved, the Planning Board shall express its
approval as conditional approval and state the conditions of such
approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express its disapproval and
its reasons therefor in the minutes of the meeting. [Amended at
time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
IV)]
(4) The action of the Planning Board shall be noted on the two copies of
the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions
determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the
other retained by the Planning Board.
(5) For any subdivision or portion of subdivision, the Planning Board
will state in writing the character and extent of required public
§ 260-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-3
1:361
improvements for which waivers may have been requested by the
subdivider and which in the opinion of the Planning Board may
be waived without jeopardy to public health, safety, morals, and
general welfare or which were inappropriate because of
inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent to or in
proximity to the proposed subdivision.
(6) Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the
final plat. Rather it shall be deemed as expression of approval to
the layout submitted on the preliminary plat, as a guide to the
preparation of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of
the Planning Board and for recording upon fulfillment of the
requirements of these regulations and the conditions of the
approval, if any.72
C. Final plat procedure.
(1) The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to
record and develop at the time; provided, however, that such
portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
(2) After three copies of the final plat have been approved by the New
York State Department of Health, they may then be submitted, with
three copies of the application for approval of the final plat, to the
Planning Board at least 14 days prior to the meeting at which it is
to be considered.
(3) The three copies of the final plat and other exhibits required for
approval shall be prepared as specified in §§ 260-4 and 260-6 and
shall be submitted to the Planning Board within six months after
approval of a preliminary plat; otherwise, such approval shall
become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and
granted by the Planning Board. [Amended 5-11-2010 by L.L. No.
7-2010]
(4) Before approval of the final plat is given, a public hearing shall be
held by the Planning Board. This hearing shall be advertised at
least once in the official Town newspaper or a newspaper of general
circulation in the Town if there is no official paper and a notice of
hearing posted in at least three prominent places at least five days
before the hearing.
(5) Within 62 days following the public hearing on the final plat, the
Planning Board shall: [Amended 5-11-2010 by L.L. No. 7-2010]
(a) Review the final plat and other material submitted for
conformity thereof to these regulations;

(b) Act thereon as submitted or modified; and
(c) If approved, express its approval, if disapproved, state its
reasons therefor in the minutes of the meeting.

appropriate notation to that effect will be made on the face of the
linen prints. One copy will be retained by the Planning Board and
the other two copies will be returned to the owner.
(7) The owner shall file one of his copies of the approved final
subdivision plan with the County Clerk within 62 days after the
approval by the Planning Board. If the final subdivision plan is not
filed within this period, the approval shall expire, as provided in
§ 276 of the Town Law.

Planning Board may extend the time for filing and recording such
plat if in its opinion such intention is warranted by the particular
circumstances thereof.

(1) The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of
all streets shall conform to the Official Map and the Comprehensive

by the Planning Board to meet a particular situation where
topographic or other conditions make continuance or
conformance to existing streets impracticable.
(3) Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged.
(4) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Planning Board may require marginal access

reservation along the rear property line, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of
§ 260-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 260-4
1:363
residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
(5) Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way
or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Board may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such
right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for
commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such
distances shall also be determined with due regard for the
requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
(6) Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed in the Town under
conditions approved by the Planning Board.

arterial streets deflect from each other by more than 5°, they shall
be connected by a curve of not less than 800 feet in radius.
(10) Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less

(11) Intersections of minor streets with arterial or collector streets shall
be held to a minimum to avoid hazard and delay.
(12) Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of 10 feet, or of a greater radius, where the Planning Board may
deem it necessary. The Planning Board may permit comparable
cutoffs or chords in place of rounded corners.

1:364
(14) Half streets shall be prohibited except where it is necessary to
provide the remaining half of a previously approved half street.
(15) Culs-de-sac shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided
at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside right-of-way
diameter of 100 feet; however, they may be longer when in the
judgment of the Planning Board they do not impose any problems
and constitute a positive design feature.
(16) Temporary turnarounds shall have a diameter of 100 feet and shall
be shown on the map with arrangements for that portion of the
right-of-way of the turnaround outside the right-of-way of the street
to revert to the abutting property owners upon continuation of the
street.
(17)No subdivision shall have a single street or system of streets with
any one street longer than 500 feet unless there exists a distinctly
second means of public vehicular access into the site.
(18)No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to
the approval of the Planning Board and should follow standard
procedures of house numbering.
(19) Street grades shall conform to the following:
Street Type Grade
Arterial As determined by state or county road
authorities
Collector 5%, and in no case shall it be waived to
exceed 7%
Minor 8%, and in no case shall it be waived to
exceed 10%
Marginal access Same as arterial

§ 270-15. Legislative findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Fallsburg has determined that, from time
to time, it would be appropriate for the Town to send notification regarding
official Town business to all property owners within the Town. The Town
Board has determined that the most cost-efficient method to provide these
notices to property owners within the Town is to include these notices with
the annual tax bill which is sent by the Town to the property owners. In this
manner, the notices could be sent with the tax bill, and the Town would save
the postage charges to send the notices separate from the tax bills.
§ 270-16. Sending of notices.
Section 1826 of the Tax Law of the State of New York permits a municipality
to send notices, circulars, pamphlets, cards, handbills, and printed or
written notices of any kind, other than advertising and propaganda material
(collectively referred to as "Official Notices"), to property owners within the
Town together with an official tax bill or notification of tax to be assessed or
levied.
§ 270-17. Town Board authorization.
In furtherance of § 1826 of the Tax Law of the State of New York, the Town
Board of the Town of Fallsburg hereby authorizes any person, corporation,
association, or agent or employee thereof, who mails or delivers or causes to
be mailed or delivered a Town tax bill or notification of a tax to be assessed
or levied, to include with said tax bill or notification any Official Notices,
provided that, in each instance in which any such Official Notice is sent, the
inclusion of such Official Notice is authorized by an appropriate resolution
of the Town Board.

General Provisions
§ 278-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Town of Fallsburg
Commercial Timber Harvesting Law."
§ 278-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health and safety of the
residents of the Town of Fallsburg through the protection of the natural
environment where affected by timber harvesting. The Town recognizes
that the timber resources in the Town are of significant value and may be
harvested. The Town also recognizes that if timber harvesting practices are
improperly performed, they can result in significant environmental damage
to the land as well as to adjacent lands and waters. Thus, this chapter is
intended to regulate those commercial harvesting activities that most often
result in environmental damage, to require reclamation efforts that will
limit subsequent environmental damage, particularly to control soil erosion
and sediment-laden runoff, and to utilize professional forest management
expertise in the preparation and evaluation of timber harvest planning.
§ 278-3. Permits required.
§ 278-4. Hazardous or harmful conditions.
Whenever any timber harvesting operation (commercial or personal)
becomes a hazard to life and limb, or endangers property or adversely
affects the safety, use or stability of a public way or drainage channel,
the owner of the property upon which the timber harvesting operation is
located, or other person or agent in control of said property, upon receipt of
notice in writing from the Code Enforcement Officer, shall, within the period
specified therein, repair or eliminate such hazard and be in conformance
with the requirements contained herein.
§ 278-5. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
A. No person shall do any commercial timber harvesting, as defined in
§ 278-5 of this chapter, without first having obtained a commercial
timber harvesting permit from the Town Code Enforcement Office.

a fee as set forth in the rate table. The meter shall remain the property
of the Town. The Department of Public Works (DPW) must have access

forth in the rate table, shall be paid prior to the installation of a new
meter in said building.

responsibility will be charged to the owner's account.

event of an emergency. A fee as set forth in the rate table will be
charged for each occurrence to turn on or off the water service at the
owner's request. No person shall interfere with or cause obstruction to
any curb box. Unauthorized use of curb stops shall be subject to a
penalty of $250 for each occurrence.
B. All service pipes and their fixtures and appurtenances from the curb
valve or gate valve and into the premises shall be maintained and kept
in repair and free from leaks at the expense of the consumer. Leaks in
service pipes shall be repaired within 48 hours after notice is given to
the consumer. If leaks are not repaired within said period, the district

unless written applications for such water service are signed by the
owner of the property to be supplied, or his agent, and have first been
approved by the district. Any person who shall be supplied with water
by the district shall be deemed to have accepted and approved the rules
and regulations pertaining thereto. The continuance to take water after
any amendment, change or addition to the rules and regulations shall
be deemed an acceptance of such.

families other than those specified in the application for service or the
use indicated by rate charges; i.e., single-family residence, commercial,
etc. If any water is so supplied, the party supplying the same shall be

water to prevent piping from freezing will be permitted, except at a
special rate and with written consent of the Department. The owner

the Town to make a tap to a Town main, he must notify the Town not
later than one week before the tap is required and must agree to the
date and exact hour that he will be ready for such tap to be made. The

then be submitted to the applicant, including a shutoff fee. In the event
that the same said owner requests the water district to resume service
within a one-year period, he will be liable for the minimum charges that
would normally have been accrued during that shutoff period, including
a turn-on fee.

[Adopted 5-9-1989]
§ 299-19. Requirements. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see
Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. IV)]
Water mains may be extended under the following circumstances:
A. Building must be in the water and/or sewer district whichever applies.
(1) Property must be in the water and/or sewer district, whichever
applies to the type of main being applied for.
(2) This requirement limits the Town's responsibility to only that
property within the district and is consistent to all laws, policies
and past practices of the Town of Fallsburg.
B. Physical main must be greater than 100 feet from property line.
(1) Physical existing Town mains must be greater than 100 feet from
the property line.

not cost-prohibitive for property owners to pay.
C. All main extensions must be on Town-owned property.
(1) All proposed main extensions must be on existing Town land, roads
or easements.
(2) This requirement restricts landlocked properties and keeps future
Town-owned mains within accessible rights-of-way. It avoids land
disputes and requires dedication of small easements to the Town.

1:507

supply and sewage disposal systems or private sewage disposal systems
may require larger lot sizes and widths than are specified because of
unusual subsoil or geological conditions found to exist on the particular
location in question. In such cases, the minimum lot area otherwise
required shall be increased where necessary to the extent required to
allow the proposed water and/or sewerage installation to operate
effectively in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

prepared by a professional engineer and submitted to the Code
Enforcement Officer and approved by him/her before a building permit
shall be issued. The suitability of the proposed systems shall conform to
the standards of the New York State Department of Health.

(1) Whenever a parcel of land is combined with an adjacent lot for the
purpose of increasing the size of the existing lots, or a number of
smaller lots are resubdivided, or reallotted so as to make a lesser
number of larger lots, or there is desired another change to the lot
which, in the Planning Board's opinion, provides an improvement to
the premises, whether regarding ingress, egress, sight distance,
safety, etc., then all applicants must receive Town of Fallsburg
Planning Board approval, provided that:
(a) Other than as set forth above, any lot proposed to be reduced
in size shall comply in all aspects with provisions of the Town of
Fallsburg Zoning Law and applicable state statutes.

width shall be less than the approved lot frontage. The driveway access to a

the close proximity of residences in the vicinity of the Town's commercial
and industrial areas and certain residential developments, including PRD,
PUD, duplex, townhouse, manufactured home developments and
multifamily developments, lighting shall be designed, directed and shielded
in such a manner that direct light does not leave the perimeter of the
site. All outdoor lighting, including the fixture, pole, and other supporting
elements, shall be designed to complement the overall design of the site
and prevent excessive glare. To minimize excessive lighting, entry points
and pedestrian crosswalks can be lit with accent lighting that helps to
define these areas. Such lighting shall be provided utilizing architecturalgrade
equipment and shall not exceed 0.9 footcandle measured at ground
level. Lower-level lighting can then be used in other areas of the site
where less lighting is required. Shorter lighting poles can also be used to
light pedestrian walkways and/or the use of light posts also referred to as
"bollards." The following additional standards shall be required:
G. Where the standards in this section are inconsistent with provisions
elsewhere in this chapter or the Town Code, the more restrictive shall

A. Title; authority. This section shall be known as the Town of Fallsburg
"Outdoor Wood-Burning Boiler Law." It is adopted pursuant to the
authority of Article 2, Subsection 10, of the New York State Municipal
§ 310-5.15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-5.16
1:539
Home Rule and the powers granted to the Town by virtue of Article IX,
Subsection 2(C)(5) of the New York State Constitution.
B. Legislative intent. Outdoor wood-burning boilers (OWB) may provide an
economical alternative to conventional heating systems. However, the
New York State Attorney General's office and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation found that OWBs are
among the dirtiest and least economical modes of heating. OWBs
produce offensive odors and fine particulate matter pollution with
negative short-term and long-term health consequences. Outdoor
wood-burning boilers (OWB) also deprive neighboring residents of the
enjoyment of their property and/or use of their premises. Since neither
federal nor New York State laws adequately regulate outdoor woodburning
boilers, this Town of Fallsburg section is intended to impose
reasonable limits and performance standards on OWBs so that OWBs
do not endanger the health, safety, comfort, and general welfare of the
residents and inhabitants of the Town of Fallsburg.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
EPA-APPROVED  An outdoor wood-burning boiler device that has
been tested and demonstrated to meet current United States
Environmental Agency (EPA) emission standards for such device, and
has received certification of approval from the EPA.
OWB  Commonly known as an "outdoor wood-burning boiler." A selfcontained
unit designed to provide heating to a building or structure,
which unit is located outside of that building or structure.
SMOKESTACK  What is commonly known as a "chimney."
D. The permitted use of all OWBs located within the Town of Fallsburg
shall not violate § 310-5.20 or § 310-5.19A(4) of the Zoning Chapter. An
order to remedy and cease usage may be issued by the Code
Enforcement Office for OWBs determined to be in violation of
§ 310-5.20 or § 310-5.19, and, until such order is complied with, the use
of the OWB shall be prohibited.
(1) OWBs shall be prohibited in the following zones: R, HR, PUD, PRD,
B and MX zones.
(2) The use and installation of such furnaces shall follow all operating
and installation instructions supplied by the manufacturer.
(3) In areas where OWBs are permitted, a property must be a minimum
of two acres.

the roof associated with the dwelling which it serves. Smokestacks
in existence prior to enactment of this law shall not be less than 12
feet high measured from the base of the OWB to the top of the
spark arrestor.
(10) Lawfully permitted OWBs that are intended for use after April 15 to
October 15 shall be required to receive a special permit from the
Zoning Board of Appeals for continued operation and only for the
purpose of heating domestic hot water or swimming pools,
provided the emissions do not generate complaints of affecting air
quality or any normal property usage of neighboring properties in
any manner that may be detrimental to humans, domestic animals,
livestock or protected wildlife.
(11) OWB boilers must be EPA-approved.
(12)No more than one OWB shall be permitted on any lot regardless of
the amount of dwellings situated on the lot.

including, but not limited to, impervious surfaces, interior
roadways and parking lots shall not exceed 25% of the
duplex development site. The calculation shall not include
steep slopes, wetlands or unusable land. See the definition
for "impervious surface."94
(3) Yard and setback requirements.
(a) Duplex development site. It is the intent of this section to treat
the yard and setback requirements for duplex developments
differently when located in hamlet centers or when located in
areas surrounding hamlet centers. When located outside of
hamlet centers, duplex developments should be visually
buffered from surrounding uses. When located in hamlet
centers, duplex developments should be integrated with the
hamlet streetscape, visually compatible with existing hamlet
development, and strongly connected to the pedestrian and
street facilities. The following standards apply when duplex
developments are located in the R or HR Districts:
94.Editor's Note: See § 310-2.2.
§ 310-5.30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-5.30
1:551
[1] Front yard and setback from external public right-of-way
or frontage street; buffer.
[a] In the R District, a minimum front yard and front
setback of 150 feet from an external public right-ofway
or frontage street shall be provided and any
existing vegetation shall remain undisturbed within 75
feet of the streetline or right-of-way line of the road
giving access and street frontage to the development.
This vegetative buffer in the first 75 feet shall provide
year-round screening of the development from the
public right-of-way. The Planning Board, in its
discretion, may require the vegetative buffer to be
supplemented with earthen berms, trees, shrubs, and
additional landscaping to achieve the objective of a
year-round vegetative buffer in a quantity and type to
be determined by the Planning Board. Driveways,
parking and maneuvering spaces, stormwater
management facilities and other accessory uses other
than buildings may be located behind the seventy-fivefoot
vegetative buffer in the remainder of the onehundred-
fifty-foot required front yard. The location of
the edge of the required undisturbed buffer shall be
flagged prior to the commencement of clearing,
grading or construction to prevent accidental
incursions during the site development process. In the
R District, the minimum side and rear yards and
setbacks shall be 50 feet from an external public rightof-
way or frontage street.
[b] In the HR District, a minimum front yard and front
setback of 35 feet from an external public right-of-way
or frontage street shall be provided. Parking and
maneuvering spaces, internal access roads, and
stormwater management facilities shall be prohibited
from the required front yard. The building facades,
walkways, and any features of the front yard shall be
oriented, connected, and integrated to the pedestrian
facilities of the frontage street of the hamlet. Chain
link fences shall be prohibited, and any fencing shall
be no higher than four feet. In the HR District, the
minimum side and rear yards and minimum side and
rear setbacks shall be 25 feet from an external public
right-of-way or frontage street.
[2] Side and rear yard buffers.
[a] In the R District, an undisturbed vegetative buffer of a
minimum of 50 feet shall be provided around the
perimeter of the duplex development site along other
lot lines than the front lot line. Where necessary, the
§ 310-5.30 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-5.30
1:552
Planning Board may require plantings to provide a
visual buffer between the duplex development and
adjacent properties. The buffer shall extend from a
side or rear property line to the outside and not be
disturbed in any way and/or built upon or improved
on. The Planning Board, in its discretion, may require
the vegetative buffer to be supplemented with earthen
berms, trees, shrubs, and additional landscaping to
achieve the objective of a year-round vegetative buffer
in a quantity and type to be determined by the
Planning Board.
[b] In the HR District, this undisturbed buffer required
may be reduced to 15 feet. The location of the edge of
the required undisturbed buffer shall be flagged prior
to the commencement of clearing, grading or
construction to prevent accidental incursions during
the site development process.
[3] Interior access roads other than the entrances or exits
giving direct access to and from the development's
frontage street shall be situated at least 75 feet back from
all property lines in the R District, and at least 35 feet in
the HR District.
(b) Duplex buildings, distances between buildings and setbacks
from internal access streets.
[1] Front yard and front setback between duplex buildings
and internal street. In the R and HR Districts, a front yard
and front setback of 15 feet from the building front to any
internal street or drive shall be required for duplex
buildings.
[2] Rear yard and rear setback between duplex buildings and
internal street. In the R and HR Districts, each duplex
building shall have a minimum rear yard and rear setback
of not less than 25 feet.
[3] Side yards and side setback between duplex buildings and
internal street. Each duplex building shall have two side
yards no less than 15 feet six inches and shall have a
minimum building separation of 31 feet. The only items
permitted within the separation distance are walkways,
and landings or decks of less than five feet in width. No
porch or similar structure shall protrude or be installed
into this required separation. If fire flow calculations can
be met, then the required separation distance between
buildings can be reduced to a minimum of 25 feet.
[4] Separation between duplex buildings. The minimum
distance between duplex buildings shall be as follows:
§ 310-5.30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-5.30
1:553
[a] Front wall to front wall: 85 feet (including street or
access road right-of-way).
[b] Side wall to side wall: 31 feet.
[c] Rear wall to rear wall: 50 feet.
(4) Minimum floor area per dwelling unit.
(a) The minimum habitable floor area per duplex unit with three or
more bedrooms shall be 1,100 square feet.

habitable floor area per duplex unit shall not exceed 2,750 square
feet. The maximum footprint for each duplex unit shall not exceed
1,750 square feet, and the number of allowable bedrooms for each
duplex unit shall not exceed six. Basements are allowed in one- and
two-story duplexes; provided, the basement wall reveal will be
limited to four feet, except in the area surrounding the basement
ingress/egress, in which case, the full basement wall may be
revealed for up to 10 feet in width. Bedrooms will be allowed in the
basement when ingress and egress is provided in accordance with
all building code requirements, and when within the allowable
number of bedrooms for the unit.
(6) Architectural design.
(a) The design and materials of individual duplex buildings shall
provide for the same total facade details or appearance for
both dwelling units.
(b) Variations in the design and materials of adjacent duplex
buildings shall be incorporated so that no more than two
abutting buildings have the same total facade details or
appearance.
(c) The design of duplex buildings and associated accessory
buildings shall be reviewed by the Planning Board with such
design elements as dormers, roof and gable end overhangs,
covered entryways, windows with shutters, etc., to provide
visual interest, particularly in areas with higher visibility to
adjacent development, pedestrian, or street traffic. The
Planning Board may refer the application to the Architectural
Review Board for its recommendations. Prior to the approval of
the design, the Planning Board shall set the review of the
building elevations and landscaping as a separately noticed
§ 310-5.30 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-5.30
1:554
agenda item for the purpose of notice and obtaining public
input.
(d) Duplex units shall be separated by a common party wall that is
designed to meet the New York State Uniform Fire Protection
and Building Code.
(e) Garages, if provided, shall be designed so as not to dominate
the front building facade through the use of offsets and
variation in the details of doors.
(f) Mailboxes shall be placed within a common area that is
complementary to the overall design of the development.
(7) Access, circulation and parking.
(a) An internal circulation system shall be designed to provide safe
and convenient access to duplex buildings and community
facilities. The internal circulation system shall be sufficient for
vehicular and bicycle movement and must accommodate fire
and emergency access needs. The right-of-way width for a
public road shall be 50 feet. The road right-of-way for a private
interior road may be no less than 35 feet. Either may have a
paved street width of 24 feet, or a twelve-foot paved street for
one-way traffic, as determined by the Planning Board.
(b) A minimum of two off-street parking spaces shall be provided
for each duplex unit on each duplex lot or within common
parking areas. An additional 1/2 space per duplex unit shall be
provided within common parking areas for visitors. Common
parking spaces may not be located on fee simple lots.
Developers must prepare construction drawings that show all
required parking on the approved plan but may elect to defer
full improvement of up to 10% of the required parking when
there is some uncertainty as to the parking demand for the
proposed development. If demand is needed in the future as
determined by the Code Enforcement Officer, the reserved
spaces must be constructed by the developer, the condominium
association, or the homeowners' association, as the case may
be. The Planning Board may approve an area designated for
the parking of commercial vehicles used by residents within a
supplemental parking area.
(c) Duplex developments in the HR zone shall be designed in a
manner which integrates roads, sidewalks, and other
improvements with other neighborhoods in the HR Zoning
District. Within the HR Zoning District, both internal and
external pedestrian sidewalks that extend the public sidewalk
system may be required by the Planning Board within all
duplex developments and along their public street frontage.
Sidewalks, if required, shall be a minimum of four feet in width
in order to provide for the safe movement of pedestrians
§ 310-5.30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-5.30
1:555
between duplex units and to and from all common recreation
facilities. Said sidewalks may be separated from the edge of
the road by a six-foot median strip provided for the planting of
street trees or grass or provided within an interior courtyard
that is owned in common by the condominium association or
a homeowners' association, as the case may be. Curbing may
also be required.
(d) The outside storage of recreational vehicles and/or boats on
individual duplex lots or in common areas shall be prohibited.
The Planning Board may authorize the provision of
recreational vehicle storage spaces within a designated area,
provided such area is screened from public view and used
solely for duplex residents.
(8) Landscaping. A landscaping plan designed by a professional
landscape architect who understands the local climate and growing
patterns shall be submitted to the Planning Board for its review and
approval. The following minimum standards shall apply:
(a) Lawns of all duplex units shall be properly graded and seeded
to provide for grass lawns.
(b) Street trees shall be provided in a quantity that is equivalent to
that of spacing the trees 30 feet on center. Such trees shall
then be grouped into groves in order to simulate a more
natural stand of trees, rather than repetitive rows. Groves of
street trees shall be a minimum height of six feet to eight feet
with a caliper of 2 1/2 inches at breast height at the time of
planting and a minimum drip-line diameter of 20 feet at full
growth.
(c) Front lawn trees shall have a height of 13 feet to 14 feet with a
caliper of 1 1/2 inches or more at breast height at the time of
planting. Species shall be consistent with the flowering type.
(d) Rear and side yard trees should include a mix of deciduous and
evergreen trees (not pine). Evergreens shall be a minimum
height of six feet at the time of planting and be used to provide
visual separation (buffer). Deciduous trees shall be four feet to
six feet with a caliper of two inches at breast height at the time
of planting and a drip-line diameter of 15 feet to 30 feet at full
growth and be located in a manner that provides shade in the
summer and sun in the winter.
(e) Shrubs and ground plantings shall be shown on the
landscaping plan.
(f) All landscaping within common areas owned by the
homeowners' association shall be well maintained and kept in a
healthy condition. When plantings die, they shall be replaced.
§ 310-5.30 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-5.30
1:556
(g) Duplex developments shall be designed so as to incorporate
existing natural wooded vegetation throughout the layout of
the site. Duplex developments shall be designed and integrated
and follow the natural topography in a manner that limits site
grading. No more than five duplex buildings shall be arranged
in a single series, pod or set. Each series, grouping or set of
five duplex buildings shall be separated by a sixty-two-foot
vegetative buffer between the next series, pod or set of duplex
buildings. Said buffer shall consist of existing wooded
vegetation which shall be preserved in its natural state. The
Planning Board shall have the discretion to determine those
wooded areas within the site which shall be preserved to
accomplish this objective.
(9) Common areas and recreational facilities.
(a) Every duplex development shall provide for common open
space and recreational amenities for project residents that are
maintained by a not-for-profit homeowners' association.
Common open space may include, but is not limited to, land left
in either a landscaped or undisturbed state for passive uses
such as observing wildlife, walking or picnicking. Recreational
amenities may include, but are not limited to, lands dedicated
to active recreation such as games, playgrounds or sports, and
may include accessory structures. Common open space and
recreational amenities shall be provided in accordance with
the following standards:
[1] The minimum lot area for common open space and
recreational amenities shall be 5,000 square feet.
[2] For a duplex development that includes more than 25
duplex units, a common recreation clubhouse shall be
provided that is at least 2,000 square feet in size. Such
structure shall provide one off-street parking for each six
persons based upon maximum permitted occupancy and
be maintained by the not-for-profit homeowners'
association. It is an option that the developer can disperse
some of these parking spaces throughout the development
so that a large parking lot is not created next to the
community building. This must be approved by the
Planning Board.
[3] The requirement of calculating the amount of common
space and recreational amenities area shall be calculated
and provided for at a rate of 750 square feet per proposed
dwelling unit and shall not include the area within the
required buffer and yard/setback, or within stormwater
basins. On large projects, the Planning Board may require
that recreational amenities be located in several areas.
§ 310-5.30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-5.30
1:557
The Planning Board shall approve the location(s) of such
recreational amenities as part of the site plan review.
(10) Utilities.
(a) All electric, telephone, and cable shall be located underground
within the proposed duplex developments.

under no circumstances can a duplex home be renovated if the
result of said renovation will violate the foregoing provisions.
(b) All offering plans applicable to the sale of homes in a duplex
development shall include a covenant and restriction in the
recorded governing documents which sets forth the size
limitations and number of bedrooms limit set forth in the Town
of Fallsburg Duplex Development Law and shall confirm that
the Town of Fallsburg Code Enforcement Officer (or his or her
authorized agents) shall have the right to inspect the duplex
home to confirm compliance with the aforesaid limitations.
(c) All fee simple lots approved in accordance with this section
shall include a covenant and restriction in a recorded
document setting forth the requirements of Subsection
A(11)(b).
(d) The portions of condominiums' and homeowners' association
documents including provisions required in this section shall
be provided to and approved by the Planning Board prior to
granting subdivision or site plan approval.
(12) Right to inspect. To insure compliance with the requirements of
this section, it shall be a condition to approval that the Town Code
Enforcement Officer (or his or her authorized agents) shall be
allowed, from time to time, to inspect the duplex homes to insure
compliance with these regulations and with all other applicable
laws, including, but not limited to, the size of the home and the

1:558
§ 310-5.31. Two-family dwelling.
The following standards shall apply to two-family residences constructed
after the effective date of this chapter. A two-family dwelling development
wherein each two-family dwelling is constructed on an individual lot and
not located with other two-family dwellings on common land shall meet
the bulk requirements applicable to the district in which it is located, and
their design may be referred to the Architectural Review Board for its
recommendations and approval. Existing legal two-family residences shall
not be considered nonconforming by virtue of the following supplementary
regulations, provided they are located in districts where such uses are
permitted:
number of bedrooms. Failure to cooperate with inspections or
noncompliance with this section shall result in revocation of the
unit certificate of occupancy.
(13) Enforcement. Any violation of the provisions of this section
(§ 310.5.30) shall be subject to fines and penalties, as follows:
(a) Fines. Fines for violating the provisions of this section shall be
established by the Town Board by resolution. The Town Board
can establish escalating fines for second and subsequent
violations, and each day of violation can be subject to
continuing additional fines.
(b) Restoration and renovation. In addition to fines, the Town Code
Enforcement Officer can require that the duplex home be
restored and/or renovated, at the sole cost and expense of the
homeowner, to the condition which existed prior to the
violation or to such other condition which is otherwise in
compliance with this section, including, but not limited to, the
elimination of one or more bedrooms. Failure to comply with
this section shall result in revocation of the certificate of

ARTICLE VI
Special Permit Uses
§ 310-6.1. General provisions.
The uses listed in Schedule I, Use and Bulk Requirements,95 as special
permit uses, for the districts in which they are permitted and subject to the
bulk regulations therefor, may be authorized on application and after public
notice and hearing by the Planning Board.
A. Approval of special use permits. The Town Board of the Town of
Fallsburg authorizes the Planning Board to review and grant special use
permits as set forth herein.
B. Applicability and standards. On application and after public notice and
hearing, the Planning Board may authorize the issuance by the Code
Enforcement Officer of permits for any of the special uses permitted in
Schedule I in the district in which such use is proposed to be located.
The Planning Board shall review an application's conformity with the
individual standards for special use permits contained herein, if
applicable, and shall also have the authority to impose such reasonable
conditions and restrictions as are directly related to or incidental to the
proposed special use permit. In approving any such use, the Planning
Board shall further the expressed intent of this chapter and the
accomplishment of the following objectives:
(1) That all proposed structures, equipment or material shall be readily
accessible for fire and police protection.
(2) That the proposed use shall be of such location, size, and character
that, in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and
orderly development of the district in which it is proposed to be
situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of
adjacent properties in accordance with the zoning classification of
such properties.
(3) That, in addition to the above, in the case of any use located in or
directly adjacent to a residential district:
(a) The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith,
its site layout and its relation to access streets shall be such
that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use
and the assembly of persons in connection therewith will not
be hazardous or inconvenient to or incongruous with said
residential district or conflict with the amount of traffic in the
neighborhood; and
95.Editor's Note: The Table of Use and Bulk Requirements is included as an attachment to
this chapter.
§ 310-6.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-6.1
1:561
§ 310-6.2. Procedure.
Application for a special permit pursuant to these regulations shall be upon
forms prescribed by the Town Planning Board and shall contain a written
description of the proposed use, with reference to the appropriate use and
bulk regulations herein, including any supplementary regulations applying
thereto. Twelve copies of every application for a special permit shall be
submitted to the Town Planning Board Secretary with the fee as set forth
in the Standard Schedule of Fees of the Town of Fallsburg. The following
general procedures shall be applied:
(b) The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of
landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not
hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of
adjacent land and buildings.
(4) The impact of the proposed use shall not engender avoidable
impacts upon the environment of the site or adjacent lands and that
any such impacts will be the minimum necessary to accommodate
the proposed use and, further, that there shall be the maximum
preservation of unique ecological or environmental assets
particularly as such affect the value and viability of adjacent areas.
C. Waiver of requirements. The Town Board herein authorizes the
Planning Board, when reasonable, to waive any of the individual
standards for the approval, approval with modifications or disapproval
of special use permits submitted for approval. Any such waiver may be
exercised in the event any such individual standards are found not to be
requisite in the interest of the public health, safety or general welfare
or inappropriate to a particular special use permit.
D. The owner shall not change, deviate, modify or vary from the
application and site plan once the same is approved by the Planning
Board.
A. Site plan. Applications for special use permits shall require site plan
approval in accordance with the site plan regulations contained in this
chapter, except that the Planning Board may waive site plan approval
for a special use permit application that will involve no physical
alteration or disturbance to a site. At a minimum, each application for a
special use shall be accompanied by a plan showing the size and
location of the lot, and the location of all buildings and proposed
facilities, including access drives, parking areas and all streets within
200 feet of the lot. The Planning Board shall deem that a special use
permit and site plan application are complete prior to the conduct of a
public hearing on the application.
B. Public hearing. The Planning Board shall conduct a public hearing
within 62 days from the day a complete special use permit application is
received. Public notice of said hearing shall be printed in a newspaper
§ 310-6.1 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-6.2
1:562
of general circulation in the Town at least five days prior to the date
thereof. Property owners within 300 feet of the project property line
shall be notified of the public hearing by certified mail by the applicant.
The applicant shall mail notice of said hearing at least 10 days before
said hearing. The Planning Board shall cause the applicant to post
notice on the subject property indicating the date, time, and location
of the public hearing, and a brief description of the action being
considered, at least 10 days prior to the public hearing date. One
notice shall be posted along each property line adjoining a road and
shall be clearly visible from said road. Notices shall be affixed in a
manner prescribed by the Planning Board. Said notice shall be removed
following the close of the public hearing.
C. Notice to the applicant, Sullivan County Planning Department and
adjacent municipalities. At least 10 days before the public hearing, the
Town of Fallsburg Planning Board shall mail notices thereof to the
applicant, the Sullivan County Planning Department, as required by
§ 239-m of the General Municipal Law, and to adjacent municipalities as
required by General Municipal Law § 239-nn, which shall be
accompanied by a full statement of the matter under consideration, as
defined in General Municipal Law § 239-m, Subdivision 1.
D. Decision. The Planning Board shall decide upon the application within
62 days after the public hearing is closed. The time within which the
Planning Board must render its decision may be extended by mutual
consent of the applicant and the Planning Board.
E. Filing. The decision by the Planning Board on the application shall be
filed in the office of the Town Clerk within five business days after such
decision is rendered and a copy mailed thereof to the applicant.
F. Existing violations. No special use permit shall be issued for property
where the Code Enforcement Officer has found a violation of this
chapter, and where such violation has not been corrected, unless the
granting of such special use permit and site plan approval will result in
the correction of said violation.
G. Area variance. Where a proposed special use permit contains one or
more features which do not comply with the zoning regulations,
application may be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals for an area
variance without the necessity of a decision or determination of an
administrative official charged with enforcement of the zoning
regulations.
H. Deemed to be conforming. Any use for which a special use permit may
be granted shall be deemed to be a conforming use in the district in
which such use is located, provided that such permit shall be deemed to
affect only the lot or portion thereof for which such permit shall have
been granted. The expansion of any special use shall require full
approval of the special use permit by the Planning Board. For purposes
of this subsection, "expansion" shall be interpreted to mean an increase
§ 310-6.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-6.2
1:563
§ 310-6.3. Individual standards for special uses.
The following individual standards are hereby established for specific
special permit uses:
in the area allocated to the special use, an increase in development
coverage, or an increase in the intensity of use, e.g., an increase in
traffic or need for on-site parking.
I. Expiration of special use permits. The grant of a special permit shall
authorize only one special permit use and shall be limited only to the
use described and approved in such permit. Special permits shall be
deemed to be indefinite authorization unless otherwise specified in the
approval thereof, but in any case shall expire within 18 months of the
date of all regulatory approval unless certificates of occupancy or use
have been issued for the special permit use. Such period may be
extended on separate application to the Planning Board. In addition, the
special use permit shall be deemed to have expired if all improvements
are not maintained and all conditions and standards complied with
throughout the duration of the special use permit.
J. Inspections. In connection with the issuance of a special use permit, the
Planning Board may establish a schedule of inspection to be conducted
by the Code Enforcement Officer to determine continued compliance
with this chapter and any conditions of the special use permit.
K. Renewal. As a condition of approval, the Planning Board may require
that special use permits be renewed periodically. Thirty days prior to
the expiration of a special use permit, the applicant shall apply to the
Code Enforcement Officer for renewal of the special use permit. The
Code Enforcement Officer shall inspect the premises to verify that the
conditions of the permit have been met. Upon a finding that there are
no violations and no complaints have been lodged against the applicant,
the special use permit shall be renewed by the Code Enforcement
Officer for a time period equal to the original special use permit
approval. However, where the Code Enforcement Officer finds that the
applicant is in noncompliance with the special use permit, or that
complaints have been lodged against the applicant, then such renewal
shall require Planning Board approval and may be granted only
following due public notice and hearing. Renewal may be withheld upon
a determination by the Planning Board that such conditions as may
have been prescribed by the Planning Board in conjunction with the

been diligently pursued, the Planning Board in its discretion may deny
the request for extension under this Subsection D, and the applicant
shall file a new site plan application and pay all required application
fees. Should the Planning Board determine, in its sole discretion, that

ARTICLE VIII
Parking, Loading, Access and Traffic Standards
§ 310-8.1. Accessory parking and loading.
A. Off-street parking requirements. Off-street parking spaces, open or
enclosed, are permitted as accessory to any use subject to the following
provisions:
(1) Parking requirements. Accessory off-street parking spaces, open or
enclosed, shall be provided for any use as specified herein. Any
land which is developed as a unit under single ownership and
control shall be considered a single lot for the purpose of these
parking regulations.
(2) Areas computed as parking spaces. Areas which may be computed
as open or enclosed off-street parking spaces include a private
garage, carport, or other area available for parking, other than a
street. A driveway within a required front yard for a one-family or
two-family residence may be used to meet the off-street parking
requirements, other than on the portion of a corner lot which is
subject to the provisions of § 310-4.1B.
(3) Size of spaces. Entrance and exit lanes shall not be computed as
parking space except for driveways for one-family and two-family
residences. Minimum parking stall width shall be nine feet,
minimum length shall be 20 feet, and a clear backup space of 24
feet shall be provided. Where parking is arranged back to back,
each parking space may share a common backup space.
(4) Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street with internal
turn-around area shall be provided. Such access shall consist of at
least one fifteen-foot lane for parking areas with 20 spaces or more.
No entrance or exit for any off-street parking area shall be located
within 75 feet of any street intersection; nor exceed a grade in
excess of 5% within 25 feet of any street line.
(5) Drainage and surfacing. All open parking areas shall be properly
drained, and all such areas shall be provided with a dustless
surface, except for parking spaces accessory to a one-family or twofamily
residence on their own individual lot. The maximum slope of
a parking area shall not exceed 5%, nor be less than 1/2 of a
percent. The regulation of a minimum of 1/2 of a percent may be
eliminated if proper drainage can be designed and approved by a
licensed engineer.
(6) Joint facilities. Required parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be
provided in spaces designed to serve jointly two or more
establishments, whether or not located on the same lot, provided
that the number of required spaces in such joint facilities shall not
§ 310-8.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-8.1
1:603
be less than the total required for all such establishments and the
establishments are on adjoining lots.
(7) Combined spaces. When any lot contains two or more uses having
different parking requirements, the parking requirements for each
use shall apply to the extent of that use. Where it can be
conclusively demonstrated that one or more such uses will be
generating a demand for parking spaces primarily during periods
when the other use or uses is not or are not in operation, the
Planning Board may reduce the total parking spaces required, but
in no case below the least requirement.
(8) Location and ownership. Required accessory parking spaces, open
or enclosed, shall be provided upon the same lot as the use to which
they are accessory or elsewhere, provided all spaces therein are
located within 300 feet walking distance of such lot. In all cases,
such parking spaces shall conform to all the regulations of the
district in which the parking spaces are located; and in no event
shall such parking spaces be located in any residential district
unless the use to which the spaces are accessory are permitted in
such residential district. Such spaces shall be in the same
ownership as the use to which they are accessory and shall be
subject to deed restriction, approved by the Planning Board,
binding the owner and his heirs and assigns to maintain the
required number of spaces available either throughout the
existence of the use to which they are accessory, or until such
spaces are provided elsewhere. The Town Board, on application,
may permit parking space in a public parking facility to be
computed in meeting parking requirements, subject to the payment
of a fee for each public parking space to be used to meet the
parking requirements as such fee may be established by the Town
Board.
(9) Parking on separate lot. Where off-street parking is located on a
separate lot than occupied by the principal use, site plan approval
for both is required.
(10)On lots divided by district boundaries. When a parking lot is
located partly in one district and partly in another district, the
regulations for the district requiring the greater number of parking
spaces shall apply to the entire lot. Parking spaces on such lot may
be located without regard to district lines, provided that no such
parking spaces shall be located in any residential district, unless
the use to which they are accessory is permitted in such district or
upon approval by the Planning Board.
(11) Prohibited use. The use of any required parking space for the
storage of any motor vehicle for sale, or for any other purpose than
the parking of motor vehicles, is prohibited.

B. Off-street loading berths. Open or enclosed are permitted subject to the
following:
(1) Loading requirements. Accessory off-street loading berths shall be
provided for any use specified herein. Any land which is developed
as a unit under single ownership and control shall be considered a
single lot for the purpose of these loading requirements.
Reasonable and appropriate off-street loading requirements for
structures and uses which do not fall within the categories listed
herein shall be determined by the Planning Board upon
consideration of all factors entering into the loading needs of each
such use.
(2) Size of spaces. Each required loading berth shall be at least 12 feet
wide, 60 feet long, and 14 feet high, except that the Planning Board
may modify these requirements in particular cases upon
consideration of all factors.
(3) Location and access. Unobstructed access, at least 10 feet wide, to
and from a street shall be provided. Such access may be combined
with access to a parking lot. All permitted or required loading
berths shall be on the same lot as the use to which they are
accessory. No entrance or exit for any off-street parking area shall
be located within 75 feet of any street.
(4) Joint facilities. Permitted or required loading berths, open or
enclosed, may be provided in spaces designed to serve jointly two
or more adjacent establishments, provided that the number of
required berths in such joint facilities shall not be less than the
aggregate of all such requirements.
(5) On lots divided by district boundaries. When a lot is located partly
in one district and partly in another district, the regulations for the
district requiring the greater number of loading berths shall apply
to the entire lot. Loading berths on such lot may not be located in
any residential district, unless the use to which they are accessory
is permitted in such district, subject to the approval of the Planning
Board.
C. Parking regulations in multiple residences or attached dwelling
developments. Wherever space is provided for the parking of five or
more vehicles in the open, such spaces shall be individually identified
by means of pavement markings. No parking space shall be located in a
front yard or within 10 feet of any lot line in side or rear yards. The
parking of motor vehicles is prohibited within 15 feet of any wall or
portion thereof of a two-or-more-family dwelling, which wall contains
windows (other than bathroom or kitchen windows) with a sill height of
less than eight feet above the level of said parking space. Parking areas
shall be screened by a substantial wall, fence, or thick hedge, approved
by the Planning Board. Generally, such screening shall not be less than
three or more than eight feet in height. No parking areas in multiple-
§ 310-8.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-8.1
1:605
residence developments shall be used for storage of partially
dismantled vehicles, and no servicing of any kind which creates
disturbing noise or fumes, or the discharge of oil or pollutants into the
drainage system of such lot, shall be permitted.
D. Driveways shall be set back a minimum of five feet from all property
lines.
E. Commercial vehicles.
(1) One commercial vehicle not exceeding 25 feet in length may be
parked on an occupied lot in an R, REC or PRD District, but not
within the required yards of such lot and in no case between the
street line and the principal building.
(2) One commercial vehicle not exceeding 25 feet in length may be
parked within a private garage in any residential district.
(3) Parking of commercial farm vehicles is permitted as accessory to a
commercial farm use in any residential district or AG District.
(4) Outdoor parking of commercial vehicles exceeding 25 feet in length
shall be prohibited in all districts, unless accessory to a commercial
farm use pursuant to Subsection E(3) above.
F. Trailers and boats.
(1) The storage or parking and use of a trailer, recreational vehicle or
boat by any person or persons are hereby prohibited in all districts,
except that:
(a) Two unoccupied trailers or recreational vehicles and two
boats, but no more than three total, may be stored, but not
occupied, on an improved lot in any residential district (except
the HR Residence District), provided that said trailers,
recreational vehicles or boats are not stored within any
required yard.
(b) Where a building permit has been issued for the construction
or alteration of a building, the Code Enforcement Officer may
issue a temporary permit for one habitable trailer for a period
not to exceed 12 months. Said temporary permit may be
extended for one additional period of 12 months if the Code
Enforcement Officer finds that construction has been diligently
pursued and that justifiable circumstances require such an
extension. Said trailer may be occupied during the term of the
temporary permit, and shall be situated upon the lot for which
the building permit has been issued. Prior to the issuance of
such a temporary permit by the Code Enforcement Officer, the
location of said trailer on the lot shall be subject to approval by
the Code Enforcement Officer.
§ 310-8.1 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-8.1
1:606
(2) In the HR Residence District, not more than one boat or trailer per
dwelling unit may be stored on an occupied lot, provided that such
boat or trailer is not stored within any required yard, nor between
the street line and the principal building.
G. Minimum off-street parking spaces in all districts. Off street parking
requirements shall be as follows: [Amended at time of adoption of

Parking for persons with disabilities: Any person, firm or corporation
owning a shopping center or facility with at least five separate retail
stores and at least 20 off-street parking spaces which are provided
for use by the public must designate as only for the handicapped and
clearly mark for use by the handicapped a minimum of 5% of such
parking spaces or 10 such spaces, whichever is less. These spaces
must be located as close as reasonably practicable to the business and
reasonably distributed so as to provide convenient access for use by
handicapped drivers.
Note: Where calculation in accordance with the foregoing list results
in requiring a fractional space, any fraction less than 1/2 shall be
dropped and any fraction 1/2 or more shall require one space. Where
circumstances require, the Planning Board may modify the parking
requirements provided in this section.
A. Spaces located on-site; or
B. An exemption or waiver in accordance with § 310-8.3.

§ 310-8.4. Traffic study.
different lawful use having the same parking and truck-loading
requirements.
B. Where a use is located within 500 feet walking distance of the entrance
to one or more municipal parking facilities, the Planning Board may
waive the required parking for such use in whole or in part. Such
waiver shall not be made unless the Planning Board shall find that
capacity sufficient to accommodate the additional demand exists at the
facility or facilities or will be provided prior to the proposed use being
put into operation.
C. Upon the establishment of a Municipal Parking Fund by the Town
Board, the Planning Board may require that a monetary contribution be
paid into said fund in lieu of provision of parking which would otherwise
be required on site. In making the determination, the Town Board shall
find that the parking requirement for the particular use cannot
reasonably be satisfied either on site or by utilization of a nearby
municipal parking facility. The amount of such payment shall be on a
per-space basis; such space figure shall be established by the Town
Board and may be amended periodically.
A. The Planning Board, at its discretion, may require a traffic impact study
by an independent engineer with any special use/site plan application
involving an activity likely to generate more than 500 trip-ends per day
based on the following daily rates:
Table 8
Trip Generation
Car washes 108.0 trip-ends per car stall
Convenience markets 605.6 trip-ends per 1,000 square
feet gross floor area
Industrial uses 3.3 trip-ends per employee
Institutional uses 4.0 trip-ends per employee
Fast-food restaurants 23.9 trip-ends per seat
Offices 6.0 trip-ends per employee
Other commercial uses 50.0 trip-ends per 1,000 square
feet gross floor area
Residential uses 9.6 trip-ends per dwelling unit
Restaurants 7.9 trip-ends per seat
Supermarkets 177.6 trip-ends per 1,000 square
feet gross floor area
Other uses See Trip Generation, Institute of
Transportation Engineers
§ 310-8.3 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-8.4
1:610
B. The study shall examine existing and projected traffic flows before and
after development and generally follow the guidelines set forth for such
studies by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. Its purpose shall
be to ensure that the standards of Subsection E below are met, and that
the proposed developments do not adversely affect the transportation
network. The study shall identify any traffic problems associated with
access to the site from the network, and it shall identify solutions to
potential problems and any improvements needed. The scope of the
study shall be approved in advance by the Planning Board with the final
product incorporated in the SEQRA submission. This requirement shall
apply in the case of state or county, as well as Town, roads.
C. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs associated with any
improvements or mitigation measures identified by the traffic study as
necessary to comply with the standards of Subsection E below. Should
the improvements or mitigation measures benefit the Town or other
parties, the Town Board may review and approve a cost-sharing plan,
with input from the Town's legal and engineering consultants. Such a
cost-sharing plan shall be based on evidence provided in the traffic
study that the costs of the proposed improvements or mitigation
measures should be allocated between the applicant and other parties,
such as the Town, county, state or other private owners, who may
benefit from such improvements constructed or implemented by the
applicant.
D. Nothing herein shall limit the Planning Board's authority to require a
traffic study for a development with lesser trips as part of its SEQRA
review obligations.
E. Traffic impact standards.
(1) No decision shall be made to approve the construction of any
development if the Planning Board determines that the result of
such development will be to create one or more of the following
peak-hour traffic impacts within two miles of any vehicular access
point to the subject site during the first year of operation of the
proposed project or, in the case of phased construction, during the
first year of operation of any phase for which approval is sought:
(a) A reduction in level of service to less than Level D at any street
intersection or for any individual traffic movement.
(b) A significant adverse impact on the operation of streets or
intersections projected to be operating during the target year,
at Level of Service E or below.
(c) Traffic volumes significantly over the capacity of the mainline
(nonintersection) highway sections.
(2) In projecting future levels of service and the capacity of mainline
highway sections, accepted traffic engineering procedures, as
§ 310-8.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-8.4
1:611
determined satisfactory by the Planning Board, shall be utilized,
using the following requirements as a guide:
(a) Base-year traffic conditions, including peak-hour traffic
volumes and turning movements, must be documented either
through direct field surveys or from other acceptable available
current data sources.
(b) Projected volumes must include estimated traffic generation
from the proposed development during peak hours of on-site
traffic activity as well as peak hours of street system activity.
(c) Daily trip generation estimates must be provided. Information
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
will generally be relied upon as a basis for estimating trip
generation, although the approving agency may allow or
require a departure from the use of specific ITE averages
where said agency determines that such departure is
warranted by unique characteristics which may be present in
the proposed project.
(d) Allowance must also be made for traffic which is expected to be
generated by other projects already approved or under
construction within the Town or within neighboring
communities, as well as an additional allowance for general
regional traffic volume changes.
(e) Estimated traffic generation must be distributed throughout
the access network in accordance with clearly stated
distribution assumptions determined acceptable by the
approving agency.
(f) The capacity analysis of the intersections or mainline-highwaysection
roadway system shall be calculated both with and
without site-generated traffic. In analyzing such capacity, the
applicant shall use methods generally recognized by national
authorities, such as the Transportation Research Board of the
National Academy of Sciences, and/or methods accepted by
the New York State Department of Transportation. Traffic
capacity estimates may take into account improvements
planned by the applicant or by others, provided that, in either
case, a specific commitment to construct such improvements
has been made.
(g) In determining overall intersection level of service at
signalized intersections, optimum practical signal timing may
be assumed. Overall intersection level of service shall be
determined, for both signalized and unsignalized intersections,
based upon a volume weighted average of each intersectionapproach
level of service.

§ 310-8.5. Landscaping of parking areas.
All parking areas which are designed to accommodate 12 or more vehicles
shall be landscaped using materials of sufficient growth and height to
aesthetically balance the impact of the open paved area and provide
effective stormwater control. The following are guideline standards the
Planning Board may apply:
A. A hedge consisting of shrubs that are two feet in height shall be planted
three feet on center between the off-street parking area and the public
right-of-way. Shrubs shall be planted a minimum of two feet off the back
of curbs or from the edge of the off-street parking area.
B. No more than 12 parking spaces should be allowed in a continuous row
uninterrupted by landscaping.
C. All landscaping within the parking lot shall be located within a
landscape island. The island shall be delineated from the surrounding
paved area by a curb or barrier of not less than six inches in height
around the perimeter of the island. The curb or barrier shall be
constructed of masonry, concrete, asphalt or heavy timber. Each island
shall be located entirely within the confines of the parking and
maneuvering area.
D. All landscape islands shall be landscaped with shrubbery, flowering
plants, mulch and at least two trees that are at least two-and-one-halfinch
caliper at breast height.
E. All parking lots with greater than 12 spaces must be at least fivepercent
landscaped. This percentage counts toward the overall
landscape requirement for the lot.
F. All tree plantings and plantings screens required by this chapter shall
be installed prior to occupancy or commencement of use. Where this
compliance is not possible because of time of year, the Planning Board
may grant an appropriate delay provided a security bond is posted.

ARTICLE IX
Nonconformities
§ 310-9.1. Policy.
§ 310-9.2. Nonconforming to performance standards for uses.
A. It is the policy of the Town of Fallsburg to provide for the limited
continuation of nonconformities where, of themselves, such
nonconformities do not endanger the public health, safety and welfare
or do not conflict with the Town's Comprehensive Plan. Additionally, it is
the intent of the Town of Fallsburg not to allow for the expansion of
existing bungalow colonies other than in the limited instances outlined
below. The following nonconformities are viewed as a detriment to the
public interest, and are as follows:
(1) Nonconformity to the performance standards of § 310-5.19.
(2) Nonconforming junkyards, garbage dumps, open storage yards,
mobile homes and unimproved parking areas.
(3) Nonconforming signs in residential districts.
(4) Nonconforming signs in other districts.
(5) Nonconforming uses in all districts.
(6) Building not in compliance with bulk regulations in all districts.
(7) Uses or buildings not in compliance with supplementary
regulations, other than performance standards.
(8) Residential uses which are nonconforming uses for the district in
which located.
(9) Nonconforming vacant lots of record.
B. Each of the classifications shall be subject to the nonconforming use
regulations herein. Where the circumstances exist that multiple
nonconforming classes exist for a single lot, development, use or
building, each of the classes shall be treated individually as set forth in
these regulations, but their determent as a nonconforming use shall be
considered. Example: The nonconforming use of a junkyard, in violation
of performance standards and with a nonconforming sign in a
residential district, shall be subject to the regulation as follows:
regulation of performance standard nonconformities; for violation of
performance standards; regulation of junkyards for the junkyard use;
and regulation of nonconforming signs, for the subject sign.
A. It is the intent of the Town Board and it is hereby declared that failure
to comply with the performance standards represents an imminent
hazard to the public health, welfare and safety and the Comprehensive
Plan (adopted by the Town Board October 10, 2006) of the Town.
§ 310-9.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-9.2
1:615
§ 310-9.3. Nonconformity uses.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, operations or uses
which violate the provisions of § 310-5.19 shall be terminated or
brought into compliance with those regulations within two weeks of
notice of such nonconformity.
B. In hearing any appeal from the provisions of this article, the Board of
Appeals may grant relief from these provisions only upon a showing by
the applicant that the violation will not present an imminent hazard to
human life, the public health, and safety, in addition to those
requirements set forth in Article XI, Enforcement. Any variance in the
time for correction of the violation shall be the minimum, consistent
with the intent of these regulations.
A. For the definition of "nonconforming use" see § 310-2.2. [Amended at
time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. IV)]
B. Applicability. The following provisions shall apply to all uses existing on
the effective date of the amendment of this chapter which do not
conform to the use regulations set forth herein and to all uses that
become nonconforming by reason of any subsequent amendment.
C. Any residential use of property containing one residential-use structure
which is located in a district in which the use is nonconforming shall be
exempt from the provisions of § 310-9.3B. A building containing a
nonconforming residential use may be altered in any way to improve
livability; however, no structural alterations shall be made which would
increase the number of dwelling units. Residential properties
containing more than one nonconforming use or structure that (or
where owners of residential properties) wish to alter or improve
livability of the dwelling as described above, shall be required to
request a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals and approvals of
site plan through the Planning Board, if granted the required variance.
D. Nonconforming uses (nonresidential). Nonconforming uses, other than
residences, of buildings or open land may be continued indefinitely but:
(1) Shall not be enlarged, altered, extended, reconstructed, restored
or placed on a different portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied
by such uses on the effective date of this chapter, nor shall any
external evidence of such uses be increased by any means
whatsoever.
(2) Shall not be moved to another location where such use would be
nonconforming.
(3) Shall not be extended to displace a conforming use.
(4) Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without
approval by the Board of Appeals, subject to a public hearing.
§ 310-9.2 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-9.3
1:616
(5) If a building that contains a nonconforming use is damaged for any
reason to an extent of 50% or less of the replacement cost of the
building or structure, exclusive of land and foundation, it may be
repaired, restored, reconstructed or used as before but not
enlarged. The floor area of such use, building or structure shall not
exceed the floor area which existed prior to such damage. All
repairs shall be completed within two years after damages occur, or
such use shall not be rebuilt except as a conforming use. Any
building that contains a nonconforming use that is damaged to an
extent greater than 50% shall be used and constructed in
compliance with the regulations contained in this chapter in
accordance with the use and bulk requirements applicable to the
district in which it is located.
E. Nonconforming commercial uses may be extended up to but not
exceeding an increase of 50% in floor area with no height increase,
subject to site plan approval by the Planning Board. The 50% addition
shall apply to the floor area occupancy at the time this chapter is
adopted. The expanded nonconforming commercial use shall comply
with the area, yard, height and other regulations of the district in which
the use is located. The Planning Board, in carrying out the provisions of
this article, may impose reasonable conditions set forth in writing, to
gradually bring preexisting development for which expansion is
proposed into closer conformance with the standards of the district in
which the use is located as is necessary to protect the public health,
safety and general welfare and, more specifically, the safety of access,
the location of refuse containers, appearance and size of signs, lights,
number and arrangement of parking spaces, and dissemination of
noxious odors, dust or other hazardous pollutants.
F. Nonconforming bungalow colony.
(1) It is the intent of the Town of Fallsburg to not promote the
expansion of bungalow colonies. In accordance with this chapter,
existing bungalow colonies shall be deemed nonconforming uses in
all zoning districts. Normal maintenance and repair of "bungalow
units" (defined as a building with one rental unit, regardless of the
number of bedrooms) and accessory structures within a bungalow
colony shall be permitted subject to the approval of the Code
Enforcement Officer. Those existing bungalow colonies with lot
coverage of less than 15% may also be expanded subject to the
following limitations:
(a) Existing bungalow units may be replaced in kind with a new
unit on the same building footprint, provided that all applicable
building separation requirements contained in the bulk table of
the Zoning Chapter98 of the zoning district can be provided or
§ 310-4.3G, whichever is more strict; regardless of whether
98.Editor's Note: The Table of Use and Bulk Requirements is included as an attachment to
this chapter.
§ 310-9.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-9.3
1:617
they are over the max lot coverage of 15%. Should separation
requirements not be met, then the required fire separation of
a two-hour fire wall shall be constructed for the exterior walls
that do not meet this requirement.
(b) The floor area of existing bungalow units may be allowed to
increase no more than 25% of its footprint in 2007, and there
shall be no increase in height of a unit, except to install a
pitched roof, provided no additional habitable space is created
and all building height requirements are otherwise met. All
applicable building separation requirements shall be met that
are contained in the bulk table of the Zoning Chapter99 or
§ 310-4.3G, whichever is more strict. This shall include adding
of decks, dens, study areas, bedrooms and any other rooms or
structures.
(c) Each building must meet the pertinent standards of the New
York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code.
(d) The proposed addition to a bungalow unit or units shall not
result in a total lot coverage exceeding 15% of the bungalow
colony site.
(e) When determining the total lot coverage, the applicant shall
demonstrate that it is using the original lot of the bungalow
colony and not using any additional lots or acreage that have
been purchased by the bungalow colony, bungalow association,
condo association, bungalow property owner or any other
person or entity.
(2) Should the existing bungalow colony be razed, any subsequent
development must fully comply with the applicable area, yard,
height and other bulk and use regulations of the district in which
the property is located.
G. Nonconforming sleepaway or day camps.
(1) It is the intent of the Town of Fallsburg to facilitate renovations and
improvements at legally existing, nonconforming sleepaway camps
and day camps in ways that do not increase their nonconformity,
and through procedures that are simple and straightforward. In
accordance with this chapter, structures at legally existing
sleepaway or day camps that do not meet the standards required in
§ 310-6.3P or Q, respectively, may undergo normal maintenance
and repairs, subject to the approval of the Code Enforcement
Officer. Changes or alterations other than normal maintenance and
repairs shall require a site plan review.

§ 310-9.4. Nonconforming buildings. [Amended at time of adoption
of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. IV)]
For the definition of "nonconforming building" see § 310-2.2.
Nonconforming buildings may be continued, repaired, structurally altered,
moved, reconstructed or enlarged, provided that such action does not
increase the degree of or create any new nonconformity to district bulk
(a) Existing structures at legally nonconforming sleepaway or day
camps may be replaced in kind with a new structure on the

separation requirements contained in the bulk table of the
Zoning Chapter100 of the zoning district can be provided, or the
requirements of § 310-4.3G, whichever is more strict. Should
separation requirements not be met, then the required fire
separation of a two-hour fire wall shall be constructed for the
exterior walls that do not meet this requirement.
(b) The floor area of an existing sleepaway or day camp building
may be allowed to increase within its existing footprint, but in
no event shall increase the floor area in existence in the

increase in the height of a building, except to install a pitched
roof, provided all building height requirements are otherwise
met.
(c) Each building must meet the pertinent standards of the New
York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code.
(d) Should the existing legally nonconforming sleepaway or day
camp be razed, any subsequent camp development must fully
comply with the applicable area, yard, height and other bulk
and use regulations of the district in which the property is
located, as well as the requirements of § 310-6.3P or Q,
respectively.
(e) Should an existing legally, nonconforming sleepaway or day
camp wish to make an application to convert to a retreat use, it
may do so without the need for obtaining a use or area
variance, if the following conditions are met:
[1] Each building designed for occupancy must be upgraded
to meet the pertinent standards of the New York State
Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code to be utilized
year-round.

A. Normal maintenance repair or incidental alteration of a structure
containing a nonconforming use or possessing nonconforming bulk is
permitted, provided that it does not increase the degree of
nonconforming use or nonconforming bulk. If a building possessing
nonconforming bulk is damaged for any reason to an extent of 50% or
less of the replacement cost of the building or structure, exclusive of
land and foundation, it may be repaired, restored, reconstructed or
used as before but not enlarged. The floor area of such use, building or
structure shall not exceed the floor area which existed prior to such
damage.
B. All repairs shall be completed within two years after damages occur, or
such use shall not be rebuilt except as a conforming use. Any building
possessing nonconforming bulk that is damaged to an extent greater
than 50% shall be constructed in compliance with the regulations
contained in this chapter in accordance with the use and bulk
requirements applicable to the district in which it is located.
A. Notwithstanding the limitations imposed by any other provisions of this
chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue a building permit for
the construction of a residential building or structure on a lot, which
does not meet the minimum area, width or yard requirements of this
chapter, provided such substandard lot was on record in the office of
the County Clerk prior to the enactment or subsequent amendment of
this chapter and met the minimum area width or yard requirements of
this chapter at the time it was recorded, prior to the enactment or
amendment of this chapter.
B. Any such substandard lot must conform to and comply with all New
York State Health Department requirements, and certification of such

two, three, four, and five years, etc., from and after the date of
appointment. Their successors, including such additional members as

five years after the expiration of the terms of their predecessors in
office. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. IV)]
C. Appointment to fill vacancies. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be for
the unexpired term of the members whose term or terms become
vacant. Such appointment to fill vacancies shall be made in the same

(ZBA) may continue to legally operate while vacancies are waiting to be
filled, provided there are enough members to constitute a quorum.
D. General grant of power. The ZBA shall perform all the duties and have
all the powers prescribed by the laws of the State of New York and as
herein described.
E. Votes necessary for a decision. Four members of the ZBA shall,
regardless of the number of members at a given point, be a quorum for
purposes of conducting any business. The concurring vote of four of the
members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Code Enforcement
Officer or to decide in favor of the appellant on any matter upon which
it is required to pass under the terms of this chapter or to effect any
variation of this chapter.
F. Meetings. All meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be held at
the call of the Chairman and at such times as such Board may

Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of
witnesses, administer oaths, compel testimony and the production of
books, papers, files and other evidence pertinent to the matters before
it.
§ 310-10.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-10.2
1:623
§ 310-10.2. Power and duties.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals pursuant to the
provisions of the laws of the State of New York and shall have the following
specific powers:
§ 310-10.3. Procedure.
A. Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals may vary or adapt the strict
application of any of the requirements of this chapter where such strict
application would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land
or building involved.
B. Appeals from administrative decisions. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer in
administering this chapter. It shall also hear and decide all matters
referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under the provisions
of this chapter.
C. Interpretation. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall, upon request from or
upon appeal of a decision by the Code Enforcement Officer, decide any
questions involving the interpretation of any provision of this chapter,
including determination of the exact location of any district boundary if
there is uncertainty with respect thereto.
A. General procedures. The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) shall act in
strict accordance with the procedure specified by § 267-b of Town Law
and by this chapter. All appeals and variance applications made to the
ZBA shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Board. Every appeal
or variance application shall refer to the specific provision of this
chapter involved and shall exactly set forth the interpretation that is
claimed, the use which is involved or sought, the details of the variance
that is applied for, and the ground on which the Zoning Board of
Appeals should grant the variance. An appeal must be made within 60
days of the action of the administrative official appealed from. The
applicant must file a signed notice of appeal with the administrative
official from whom the appeal is taken and with the Secretary of the
Zoning Board of Appeals. All information required thereon shall be
complete before an appeal is considered filed. Three copies of the
proper appeal form shall be filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals
along with a fee to be established by the Town Board. This application
must be submitted 15 days prior to the Zoning Board of Appeals'
meeting date.
B. Variance requirements. Any property owner, tenant or representative
thereof may, in appealing a decision of the Code Enforcement Officer of
the Town of Fallsburg with respect to this chapter, request a variance
from its literal terms. Application for a variance may be made after an
application for a building permit has been denied and shall be delivered
§ 310-10.2 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-10.3
1:624
§ 310-10.4. Types of variances.
Two types of variances may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeal: area
variances and use variances. Area variances involve relief from dimensional
or other requirements for existing uses or uses allowed within the district
under the terms of this chapter. Use variances involve a use of land not
allowed in a district under the terms of this chapter. Each of the following
findings of fact shall be made in writing by resolution by the Zoning Board
of Appeals prior to granting such variances.
to the Code Enforcement Officer who shall then, in acting upon the
permit application, refer the matter to the Zoning Board of Appeals for
a decision on the variance request. This shall not, however, preclude
an applicant whose permit request has been denied from subsequently
requesting a variance in conjunction with an appeal of such action if
the appeal has been timely filed. The needs or desires of a particular
owner or tenant or of a particular prospective owner or tenant shall
not either, alone or in conjunction with other factors, afford any basis
for the granting of a variance. The fact that the improvements already
existing at the time of the application are old, obsolete, outmoded or
in disrepair or the fact that the property is unimproved shall not be
deemed to make the plight of the property unique or to contribute
thereto.
C. All State Environmental Quality Review Act101 provisions and New York
State General Municipal Law § 239 referral provisions must be
complied with.
A. Area variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power,
upon an appeal from a decision or determination of the administrative
official charged with the enforcement of such ordinance or local law, to
grant area variances as defined herein.
(1) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and
welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In
making such determination, the Board shall also consider whether:
(a) An undesirable change will be produced in the character of the
neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be
created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) The benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some
method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area
variance;
(c) The requested area variance is substantial;
101. Editor's Note: See NY Envir Conser § 8-0101 et seq.
§ 310-10.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-10.4
1:625
(d) The proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on
the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood
or district; and
(e) The alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration
shall be relevant to the decision of the Board of Appeals, but
shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the area
variance.
(2) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate
and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
B. Use variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals, on appeal from the
decision or determination of the administrative official charged with the
enforcement of such ordinance or local law, shall have the power to
grant use variances, as defined herein.
(1) No such use variance shall be granted by a board of appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that for each and every
permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) The alleged hardship has not been self-created. For example, if
an owner purchases a residentially zoned property for the
purpose of opening a commercial business, the hardship is selfcreated.
(2) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proven by the
applicant, and at the same time preserve and protect the character
of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
C. Imposition of conditions. The Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of
both use variances and area variances, have the authority to impose
§ 310-10.4 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-10.4
1:626
§ 310-10.5. Requirements applicable to other appeals.
§ 310-10.6. Hearings.
such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to
and incidental to the proposed use of the property. Such conditions
shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of the Zoning Ordinance
or local law, and shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any
adverse impact such variance may have on the neighborhood or
community.
A. The Town Board, Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board of the
Town of Fallsburg may request the Zoning Board of Appeals to decide
any question involving the interpretation of any provision of this
chapter and shall refer such other matters to the Zoning Board of
Appeals as it is required to decide by the provisions of this chapter. The
Zoning Board of Appeals' rules and regulations shall govern these
matters. All matters to be referred to the Zoning Board of Appeals in
such circumstances shall be in writing to the ZBA's Secretary and be
acted on within 62 days of the Secretary's receipt of the same.
B. Any property owner, tenant, representative thereof or other person
aggrieved by an administrative act of the Code Enforcement Officer of
the Town of Fallsburg with respect to this chapter (i.e., believes such
decision to be in error) may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals. An
administrative act shall only include any order, requirements, decision
or determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion
ought to be made on the premises and to that end shall have all the
powers of the official(s) from whom the appeal is taken.
C. The administrative official from whom the appeal is taken shall be
responsible, at the direction of the Zoning Board of Appeals, for
providing any applicant with the proper forms and for instructing the
parties concerned on the proper manner for completing and filing said
forms. All information required thereon shall be complete before an
appeal is considered filed.
A. Time of hearing. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall schedule a hearing
on all appeals on applications within 62 days of the filing of an
application for an appeal.
B. Notice of hearing. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall give notice of the
hearing at least five days prior to the date thereof by publication in the
official Town paper. In addition, the applicant shall notify by certified
mail at least seven calendar days before the hearing the following: all
owners of property which lie adjacent to that owned by the applicant
and all other owners within 300 feet of the applicant's property line in
any direction. The names of said owners shall be taken as they appear
on the last completed tax roll of the Town.
§ 310-10.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-10.6
1:627
(1) Irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence or cross-examination may
be excluded. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the burden
of proof shall be on the party who initiated the proceedings. No
decision, determination or order shall be made except upon
consideration of the record as a whole or such portion thereof as
may be cited by any party to the proceeding and as supported by
and in accordance with substantial evidence.
(2) Unless otherwise provided by any statute, the Board need not
observe the rules of evidence observed by courts, but shall give
effect to rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to
evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record.
Subject to these requirements, an agency may, for the purpose of
expediting the hearing, and when the interests of parties will not be
substantially prejudiced thereby, adopt procedures for the
submission of all or part of the evidence in written form.
(3) All evidence, including records and documents in the possession of
the agency of which it derives to avail itself, shall be offered and
made a part of the record, and all such documentary evidence may
be received in the form of copies of excerpts, or by incorporation by
reference. In case of incorporation by reference, the materials so
incorporated shall be available for examination by the parties
before being received in evidence.
(4) Official notice may be taken of all facts of which judicial notice
could be taken and of other facts within the specialized knowledge
of the Zoning Board of Appeals. When official notice is taken of a
material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record and of
which judicial notice could be taken, every party shall be given
notice thereof and shall on a timely request be afforded an
opportunity prior to the decision to dispute the fact of its
materiality.
C. (Reserved)
D. Prior to the date of any public hearing, the Secretary of the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall transmit to the Chairman of the Planning Board
a copy of any appeal or application, together with a copy of the notice of
such hearing. The Planning Board may submit to the Zoning Board of
Appeals an advisory opinion on said appeal or application at any time
prior to the rendering of a decision by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
E. Should any action by the Zoning Board of Appeals involve any of the
areas specified in §§ 239-l, 239-m and 239-nn of Article 12-B of the
General Municipal Law, then the matter shall be referred prior to final
action by the Zoning Board of Appeals to the Sullivan County Planning
Department and/or adjoining municipalities in accordance with that
law. A report of the Board of Appeals' final action must be submitted to
the county within seven days of such action.
§ 310-10.6 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-10.6
1:628
F. The Zoning Board of Appeals must reach a decision within 62 days of
the close of the hearing.
G. Every decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be recorded in
accordance with standard forms adopted by the Board and shall fully
set forth the circumstances of the case and shall contain a full record of
the findings on which the decision is based. Every decision of the Board
shall be by resolution, and each such resolution shall be filed in the
office of the Town Clerk by case number under one of the following
heads: interpretation, or variances; together with all documents
pertaining thereto. Regarding its decision in each case, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall notify the Code Enforcement Officer, Town
Board, Planning Board, and the Municipal Clerk of any affected
municipality given notice of hearing.
H. All the provisions of this chapter relating to the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall be strictly construed. Said board as a body of jurisdiction
shall act in full conformity with all provisions of law and of this chapter
and in strict compliance with all limitations contained therein.
I. Expiration. Unless construction is commenced and diligently pursued
within six months of the date of the granting of the variance, such
variance shall become null and void.

1:631
(7) Every application for a land use permit shall be accompanied by a
plot plan drawn to scale and signed by the person responsible for
such drawing, showing the manner in which the land is proposed to
be used, and any proposed fencing, screening and landscaping.
B. No building permit shall be issued for the construction or alteration of
any building upon a lot without access to a street or highway except
upon application to and approval by the Board of Appeals as set forth in

affecting subject property have been enacted in the interim, the Code
Enforcement Officer may authorize in writing the extension of either of
the above periods for an additional six months, following which no
further work is to be undertaken without a new building permit.

required retaining walls.
F. If, in the opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer, work has ceased and
there is an apparent emergency (i.e., runoff of siltation, erosion or

abate a direct hazard or immediate danger to the real property
environment or the public, he may, without prior notice or hearing,
issue an order citing the violation and directing that such action be
taken as is necessary to remove or abate the hazard or danger.

safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare. It is not intended by this
chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants
or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this
chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of a building or
premises, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by
any other statute, local law, rule, regulation or permit, or by any easement,
or agreement, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
§ 310-13.2. Effect on prior enactments.
§ 310-13.3. Illegality or unconstitutionality.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, word, section or part of this chapter

ARTICLE XIV
Cluster Developments
§ 310-14.1. General.
A. Chapter 260, Subdivision of Land, of the Code of the Town of Fallsburg
provides for the clustering of proposed developments as authorized
under § 278 of the Town Law of the State of New York. The Planning
Board may approve cluster developments in all residential zoning
districts according to the procedures and requirements specified below.
The purpose of this provision is to allow an alternative permitted
method for the layout, configuration and design of lots, buildings and
structures, roads, utility lines and other infrastructure, parks, and
landscaping in order to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of
open lands as described further below.
B. The provisions of this section shall apply throughout the Town of
Fallsburg.
C. In order to increase design flexibility, two or more contiguous parcels of
land, including parcels separated by a town, county, state, or private
road, may be grouped together as one cluster, provided the parcels are
in common ownership and are merged into one parent parcel.
D. The application of these provisions shall be guided by the important
physical, cultural and natural features of the particular property under
review as follows:
(1) Steep slopes.
(2) Freshwater wetlands under the regulatory jurisdiction of the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and/
or the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
(3) One-hundred-year floodplains as identified on Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) maps.
(4) Properties listed on the National and/or State Registers of Historic
Places or eligible for listing by the New York State Office of Parks,
Recreation and Historic Preservation for inclusion on such
registers.
(5) Lands containing a farm operation within a New York State
Agricultural District or within 500 feet of lands containing a farm
operation within a New York State Agricultural District.
(6) Significant viewsheds as determined by the application of the State
Environmental Quality Review Act.102
(7) Recreational resources, including lakes, ponds, streams, or other
potentially significant recreational resources.
102. Editor's Note: See NY Envir Conser § 8-0101 et seq.
§ 310-14.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-14.1
1:641
§ 310-14.2. Procedure.
(8) Known habitats containing endangered, threatened, or special
concern wildlife species, protected native plants, endangered,
threatened, or rare plants, or state-identified significant habitats.
(9) Unique or unusual land forms or geological formations.
(10) Existing or potential trails including bikeways, hiking trails or
multiuse, nonmotorized routes of local, county, state or national
significance.
A. Submission of a cluster development. An applicant, at its discretion,
may submit a cluster subdivision application. The applicant shall submit
to the Planning Board a conservation plan, a conventional subdivision
plan, and a conceptual cluster plan with the filing of the application for
preliminary subdivision application.
B. The Planning Board shall review the conservation, cluster and
conventional plans and shall require such other and further details for
each plan that it reasonably believes necessary to evaluate same. Until
all reasonably requested information is submitted, the application for
preliminary subdivision approval shall be deemed incomplete.
C. Conservation value analysis and plan.
(1) In order to determine the conservation value of open space on a
specific parcel of land, the applicant shall prepare and the Planning
Board shall review a conservation plan of such parcel. The open
space protected pursuant to this section shall have conservation
value which may include historic, ecological, agricultural, water
resource, scenic, or other natural resource value. Lands with
conservation value include scenic view corridors, agricultural land,
including land with prime farmland soils or soils of statewide
importance, aquifers and their recharge areas, ecological habitat
for sensitive species, historic buildings or landscapes, large areas
or contiguous forest, ridgelines and hillsides visible from public
roads or other public areas, state or federal wetlands, lakes, water
bodies, and stream corridors. These areas shall be mapped on a
separate conservation plan which clearly demarcates these areas.
(2) The Planning Board shall review the conservation plan, and
determine which resources are to be protected as open space. The
open space is separate and in addition to any land which the
Planning Board deems must be set aside for active recreation
pursuant to § 260-4F of the Town of Fallsburg subdivision
regulations. A minimum of 50% of the gross area of the parcel shall
be set aside for conservation as part of a cluster layout. The
Planning Board may waive the amount of open space to be set aside
for conservation depending on the unique attributes of the parcel;
however, in no event shall the amount of open space be reduced to
§ 310-14.1 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-14.2
1:642
§ 310-14.3. Design standards for cluster subdivisions.
an amount less than 35% of the parcel's gross acreage. Open
space shall not be spaces in between buildings, but shall be large
contiguous expanses protected by conservation easement. Open
space shall not be located on more than three lots unless the
Planning Board finds that the open space areas can be adequately
protected where located on a larger number of lots.
D. Review of conventional subdivision plan to determine residential yield.
(1) The conventional subdivision plan shall be submitted to establish
the maximum number of dwellings or lots that shall be permitted
on the subject property, referred to as the "residential yield." The
permitted number of dwelling units in a cluster subdivision shall in
no case exceed the number of units that, in the Planning Board's
judgment, would be permitted if the land were subdivided into lots
conforming to the minimum lot size and density requirements of
this chapter, the Town Subdivision Regulations, Sullivan County
and New York State Department of Health regulations, and all
other applicable local, state and federal laws, regulations and
standards. The basis for this determination will be a conventional
subdivision plat for the subject parcel showing all environmental
constraints as per § 310-5.4 of this Zoning Chapter, as well as roads
(including road grades), stormwater basins, required setbacks for
individual wells and septic systems, and other information as may
be required by the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall, by
resolution, establish the maximum residential yield upon a review
of the conventional plan layout. The Planning Board may waive
submission of documentation of the full residential yield where, in
the Planning Board's judgment, the number of lots proposed is
substantially less than the total allowable residential yield,
provided that the plat contains a notation clearly indicating the
reduction in the total lot count for the remaining unsubdivided
parcel.
E. Cluster layout. If the developer chooses a cluster layout, using the
conservation plan as a basis for determining areas to be protected as
open space, the applicant shall design a cluster plan layout which
preserves the natural attributes and resources that have been
prioritized by the Planning Board as areas which shall remain as open
space.
F. Ten percent of the result in Subsection D above may be added to the
unit total allowable units permitted as a density bonus if a cluster
development plan is utilized rather than a conventional subdivision
plan.
G. For purposes of SEQRA, said resolution shall not be deemed to be an
action subject to SEQRA review.
§ 310-14.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-14.3
1:643
A. Allowable uses. The residential uses allowed within a zoning district
shall be the same as the uses otherwise permitted by right in the
district, except that a duplex development and a manufactured home
development are not permitted in connection with a cluster subdivision
as they are regulated under separate standards. Nothing herein shall
require the Planning Board to approve a cluster development where the
dwelling units are located on common land and are held on
condominium ownership unless the applicable zoning district permits
residential uses on common lands or in HOA ownership. The total
number of dwellings shall not exceed the maximum residential density
determined in § 310-14.2.
B. Subdivision of clustered lots. No further subdivision of any lots in the
cluster subdivision shall be permitted. A map note specifying this
restriction shall be included on the final subdivision plan.
C. A building envelope shall be established on each residential lot and
delineated on the final cluster plat. No paved areas or other impervious
areas may be created beyond the building envelope. No buildings may
be constructed beyond said building envelopes, except that the
Planning Board, in its discretion, may allow outbuildings such as barns
or sheds associated with agricultural operations to be located in an
open space area which is preserved for agricultural uses.
D. Utilities. A cluster development may be served by private individual
wells, private individual septic systems, or by public or private water
and sewer facilities, each approved by the appropriate agency or other
entity having jurisdiction. All water, sewer and gas lines, power,
telephone, cable and other communication services shall be installed
underground in compliance with state and local regulations.
E. Arrangement of lots and dwelling units. The following guidelines shall
apply:
(1) Retain and reuse existing old farm roads and lanes rather than
constructing new roads or driveways. This minimizes clearing and
disruption of the landscape and takes advantage of the attractive
way that old lanes are often lined with trees and stone walls. (This
is not appropriate where reuse of a road would require widening in
a manner that destroys trees or stone walls.)
(2) Preserve stone walls and hedgerows. These traditional landscape
features define outdoor areas in a natural way and create corridors
useful for wildlife. Using these features as property lines is often
appropriate, as long as setback requirements do not result in
constructing buildings in the middle of fields.
(3) Avoid placing buildings in the middle of open fields. Place buildings
either at the edge of fields or in the ecologically least significant
parts of wooded areas where they will be less intrusive to views
from adjacent roads, trails or high viewpoints.
§ 310-14.3 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-14.3
1:644
(4) Use existing vegetation and topography to buffer and screen new
buildings if possible, unless they are designed and located close to
the road in the manner historically found in the Town. Site
buildings in groups or tuck them behind tree lines or knolls rather
than spreading them out across the landscape in a sprawl pattern.
(5) Minimize clearing of vegetation at the edge of the road, clearing
only as much as is necessary to create a driveway entrance with
adequate sight distance. Create curves in driveways, with due
regard to safety issues, to increase the screening of buildings.
(6) Situate buildings so that they do not protrude above ridgelines as
seen from public places and roads. Use vegetation as a backdrop to
reduce the prominence of the structure. Wherever creating vistas
is intended, open up views by selective cutting such as removal of
understory vegetation and pruning lower branches of large trees,
rather than by clearing large areas or removing large trees.
(7) Minimize crossing of steep slopes with roads and driveways.
(8) Buildings are not permitted on environmentally constrained land as
set forth in § 310-5.4.
(9) The required open space land may not include private yards located
within 75 feet of a principal building.
F. Parcels in more than one district. Density calculations shall be made
separately for the portion of the parent parcel in each district. This
density may then be combined and distributed anywhere within the
parent parcel, provided that the layout and design are consistent with
the purposes of each district, the dwelling unit is permitted in the
applicable zoning district, and that dwelling units are clustered at
higher densities in the higher density district.
G. Minimum lot area and yard requirements: one-family dwellings. In the
AG and REC Zoning Districts, the minimum lot size shall be one acre. In
the R District, the minimum lot area shall be 10,000 square feet. In the
HR District, the minimum lot area shall be 7,500 square feet. Onefamily
dwellings shall be located on individual lots. Larger lot areas
shall be required, where necessary, to meet applicable health
department standards for on-site water and wastewater facilities. The
minimum yard requirements for one-family dwellings on an individual
lot shall be established by the Planning Board, but shall not be less than
1/2 the yard dimensions required for a one-family dwelling within the
applicable zoning district.
H. Minimum lot area and yard requirements: townhouse and multifamily
dwellings.
(1) Separation between units. A townhouse dwelling shall be located
on an individual lot that shall coincide with the footprint of each
dwelling. Garages shall be attached to the dwelling. Townhouse
§ 310-14.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-14.3
1:645
developments shall comply with the requirements set forth in
Article XVIII, except that the density shall be determined in
accordance with these provisions. A special use permit shall not
be required. Multifamily dwellings may be located on a single lot
and shall require a minimum separation distance of 31 feet of
green space between buildings. The only items permitted within
this separation distance are walkways, and landings or decks of
less than five feet in width. No porch or similar structure shall
protrude or be installed into this required separation. If fire flow
calculations can be met, then the required separation distance
between buildings can be reduced to a minimum of 25 feet. Any
parking areas serving multifamily dwellings shall be located no
closer than 50 feet to any building it serves.
(2) Buffer requirements. A townhouse development and multifamily
development shall have a minimum front yard setback of 175 feet
from an external public right-of-way, and any existing vegetation
shall remain undisturbed within 100 feet of the road giving access
to the development. This vegetative buffer shall provide year-round
screening of the development from the public right-of-way. The
Planning Board, in its discretion, may require the vegetative buffer
to be supplemented with earthen berms, trees, shrubs, and
additional landscaping to achieve the objective of a year-round
vegetative buffer in a quantity and type to be determined by the
Planning Board. The access driveway is the only permitted
installation within the one-hundred-seventy-five-foot setback.
(3) Any recreational area, clubhouse, or other accessory structures
associated with a townhouse or multifamily development shall be
shown on the subdivision and/or site plan, or areas on the plan shall
be reserved for such purposes, and shall be subject to Planning
Board site plan approval at such time a building permit is
submitted for their construction. Nothing herein shall be construed
to allow the deferral of any accessory improvements that the
Planning Board shall require for the operation and maintenance of
the development.
I. Building height. The Planning Board is not authorized to vary the
applicable height limitation for any buildings or structures within a
cluster development.
J. Permanent open space in cluster developments.
(1) Open space land. Protected open space may be included as a
portion of one or more large building lots, or may be contained in a
separate open space lot. Such open space may be owned by a
homeowners' association, one or more private landowners, a
nonprofit organization, the Town or another governmental entity, or
any other appropriate entity. The open space area, when located on
individual lots to remain in private ownership, shall be demarcated
by survey markers in a form to be approved by the Planning Board.
§ 310-14.3 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-14.3
1:646
A management plan for the open space land shall be prepared by
the applicant and submitted to the Planning Department for filing
prior to signing the final cluster plan. The open space management
plan is for purposes of documenting the location of the open space
or conservation area, and ensuring no encroachment occurs to
same except to allow those activities permitted within the
easement, e.g., agricultural operations. The following
documentation shall be included in the report:
(a) Location map. Property shown on the Town Zoning Map or
other parcel-based map with area shown within 1,500 feet of
the project site, with the property highlighted.
(b) Metes and bounds description.
(c) An eleven-inch-by-seventeen-inch map or larger of the PB
approved site plan or subdivision plan illustrating clearly the
conservation easement area. The map shall show parcel
boundaries, topography, wetlands, and existing structures, if
any.
(d) An up-to-date aerial map of the property.
(e) Photo key map, using map described in Subsection J(1)(d)
above as base, with photos as per Subsection J(1)(g) below.
(f) Photographs of the conservation easement area, keyed to the
features shown on the approved plan, shall be submitted after
conservation easement markers are installed. The baseline
report shall include compass direction and description of the
photo subject. All existing structures and the existing condition
(wetland, forest, etc.) within the open space or conservation
area shall be described in a narrative, referencing photos
taken. Use of GPS for purposes of accurately identifying
locations from which photos are taken is recommended,
especially where there are few reference points, e.g., middle of
woods. It is preferable for baseline photos to be taken when
snow cover is not present.
(g) The applicant shall certify (through signature) the report as
being accurate.
(2) Open space set aside in a cluster development shall be permanently
protected as required by this subsection. Such land may be
included as a portion of one or more large parcels on which
dwellings and other structures are permitted, provided that the
Planning Board approves such configuration of the open space as
part of its approval. Any development permitted in connection with
the setting aside of open space land shall not compromise the
conservation value of such open space land.
§ 310-14.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-14.3
1:647
(3) Notations on plat or site plan. Protected open space land shall be
clearly delineated and labeled on any final site plan as to its use,
ownership, management, method of preservation, and the rights, if
any, of the owners of other lots in the subdivision to such land. The
plat or site plan shall clearly show that the open space land is
permanently reserved for open space purposes, and shall contain a
notation indicating the liber and page of any easements required to
be filed prior to the filing of the map to implement such restrictions.
(4) Permanent protection by conservation easement. A perpetual
conservation easement restricting development of the open space
land and allowing use only for agriculture, passive recreation,
protection of natural resources, or similar conservation purposes,
may be utilized to ensure its preservation, pursuant to § 247 of the
General Municipal Law and/or §§ 49-0301 through 49-0311 of the
Environmental Conservation Law. If utilized, said easement may be
granted to the Town, with the approval of the Town Board, or to a
qualified not-for-profit conservation organization acceptable to the
Planning Board. If employed, the conservation easement shall be
recorded in the County Clerk's office prior to or simultaneously
with the filing of the final subdivision plat in the County Clerk's
office or a site plan in the Planning Department.
(5) Ownership of Open Space Land: Homeowners' Association (HOA).
(a) If the land is owned in common by an HOA, such HOA shall be
established in accordance with the following:
[1] The HOA documentation must be submitted to the
Planning Board before the final subdivision plat is
approved, and must comply with all applicable provisions
of the General Business Law.103
[2] Membership must be mandatory for each lot owner, who
must be required by recorded covenants and restrictions
to pay fees to the HOA for taxes, insurance, and
maintenance of common open space, common driveways,
and other common facilities.
[3] The open space restrictions must be in perpetuity.
[4] The HOA must be responsible for liability insurance,
property taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and
other facilities and common driveways.
[5] Property owners must pay their pro rata share of the costs
in Subsection J(5)(a)[4] above, and the assessment levied
by the HOA must be able to become a lien on the property.
103. Editor's Note: See NY Gen Bus § 1 et seq.
§ 310-14.3 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-14.3
1:648
§ 310-14.4. Site plan approval for cluster developments.
[6] The applicant shall make a conditional offer of dedication
to the Town, binding upon the HOA, for all open space to
be conveyed to the HOA. Such offer may be accepted by
the Town, at the discretion of the Town Board, upon the
failure of the HOA to take title to the open space from the
applicant or other current owner, upon dissolution of the
association at any future time, or upon failure of the HOA
to fulfill its maintenance obligations hereunder or to pay
its real property taxes.
[7] Ownership shall be structured in such a manner that real
property taxing authorities may satisfy property tax claims
against the open space lands by proceeding against
individual owners in the HOA and the dwelling units they
each own.
[8] The attorney for the Planning Board shall find that the
HOA documents presented satisfy the conditions above,
and such other conditions as the Planning Board shall
deem necessary.
(6) Maintenance standards.
(a) Ongoing maintenance standards shall be established,
enforceable by the Town against an owner of open space land
as a condition of approval, to ensure that open space land is
not used for storage or dumping of refuse, junk, or other
offensive or hazardous materials, or in any manner not
approved by the Planning Board.
(b) In the event that the maintenance, preservation, and/or use of
the open space area(s) ceases to be in compliance with any of
the requirements of the Zoning Chapter or any other
requirements specified by the Planning Board when approving
the cluster subdivision plat, the Town shall be granted the right
to perform such maintenance as may be necessary or to
otherwise assure compliance and to charge the cost to the
responsible property owner or owners. Such charge, if unpaid
for more than 60 days, shall become a lien on the open space
area and on the lots of any lot owners who share ownership of
the open space area. Notwithstanding, the Town is under no
obligation to maintain such open space areas.
A. Where a cluster subdivision has been designed with multiple dwellings,
a site plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning Board
prior to the issuance of a building permit in a cluster development. No
building permit shall be issued for any structures, uses or construction
activities other than those depicted on the approved site plan.
§ 310-14.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-14.4
1:649
B. The site plan shall include all elements required by Article VII of this
chapter.
C. Nothing contained in this article shall relieve the owner or his or her
agent or the developer of a proposed cluster development from
receiving subdivision plat approval in accordance with Chapter 260,
Subdivision of Land. In approving the final plat for a cluster
development, the Planning Board may modify the acreage requirement
for recreation areas required by Chapter 260, Subdivision of Land,
provided that the common area dedicated meets all other requirements
of Chapter 260, Subdivision of Land.
D. Prior to site plan approval, the developer shall file with the Planning
Board a performance bond to ensure the proper installation of all park
and recreation improvements shown on the site plan and a maintenance
bond to ensure proper maintenance of all common lands until the

shall be held within 62 days of receipt of a complete site plan. Said
hearings may be held simultaneously if the Town so wishes.
E. Within 62 days after the public hearing, the Planning Board shall act to
approve or disapprove the site plan. If the Board approves the site plan,
it shall forward a recommendation for a zoning change approval to the
Town Board. The Town Board shall then act to approve or disapprove
the zoning change to create a PUD via a resolution. Such action shall
have the effect only of granting permission for development of the
specific proposal, in accordance with this chapter within the area so
designated, with the specification, plans and elevations submitted.
F. Nonresidential uses may be allowed, or required, where such uses are
designed to service the residents of the PUD.

ARTICLE XVI
Planned Resort Development District
§ 310-16.1. Planned resort development standards.
A. Intent. The Planned Resort Development (PRD) Zoning District is
intended to address the unique nature of the Town's existing large
properties which were originally developed as resorts, by encouraging
the continuance of existing resort, retreat, and other present uses, and
encouraging the future adaptive reuse of such properties for
comprehensively planned uses, including mixed-use developments that
are planned as a single unit as part of a Planned Resort Development
(PRD). Developments within the PRD District are intended to preserve
large areas of open space so that such developments are compatible
with the natural surroundings of the development's environs. The PRD
regulations allow a range of residential, nonresidential, educational,
nonprofit, recreational and open space uses, and a potential mix of
uses, in accordance with performance criteria. This district encourages
creativity and innovations in site design and the protection of
ecologically sensitive land.
B. Objectives. In order to carry out the intent of this article, development
within the Planned Resort District is intended to achieve the following
objectives:
(1) Promote economic development while encouraging development in
a manner that protects the rural character of the Town of Fallsburg.
(2) Allow an appropriate range of uses suited to the large nature of
tracts within the zoning district, to permit and encourage
continuation of existing uses, allow suitable new uses, and
encourage innovatively planned mixed uses and resort-related
uses, including the residential, nonresidential, recreational, and
open space uses outlined in Schedule I, Table of Use and Bulk
Requirements.104
(3) Allow accessory facilities normally associated with permitted uses
and as outlined in Schedule I, Table of Use and Bulk Requirements.
(4) Protect and enhance the economic vitality of the hamlets in the
Town of Fallsburg by providing for uses in the Planned Resort
Development that are compatible with, and not necessarily in
direct competition with, the uses permitted in the hamlet centers.
(5) To the maximum extent practicable, preserve water bodies,
wetlands, steep slopes, hilltops, ridgelines, major stands of trees,
outstanding natural topography, significant geological features,
and other areas of scenic and ecological value.
104. Editor's Note: The Table of Use and Bulk Requirements is included as an attachment to
this chapter.
§ 310-16.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-16.1
1:657
(6) Prevent soil erosion and minimize flood hazards.
(7) Permit the innovative and staged development of land which allows
for an orderly transition of land from vacant to occupied use.
(8) Allow the development of an appropriate mix of uses, as part of an
approved Planned Resort Development in a manner that protects
the Town's fiscal base at all stages of the planned resort's buildout.
C. Approvals required.
(1) Any landowner proposing to develop a vacant site in the PRD
District, or to redevelop an existing site, for a new or different use,
or a Planned Resort Development (PRD) shall first apply and obtain
the permits required in Schedule I, Table of Use and Bulk
Requirements,105 as summarized in Subsection D below.
(2) Existing uses within the PRD District shall, without further action,
be deemed conforming uses, and the existing development thereon
may continue indefinitely, without the need to apply for a site plan
or special permit, as may be required by Schedule I. Where the
existing development is devoted to a use which requires site plan
approval under Schedule I, such existing development shall be
required to obtain site plan approval only for those actions that
require site plan review in accordance with Article VII of this
chapter. Where the existing development is devoted to a use which
requires a special permit under Schedule I, an extension or
addition to such use shall require special use permit approval, as
provided in § 310-9.6.
D. Uses allowed in a PRD. Schedule I in the Table of Use and Bulk
Requirements106 sets standards for the permitted uses within the PRD
District. The construction of a one-family dwelling on the grounds of an
existing PRD shall be permitted without the requirement of site plan
approval. The development of multiple one-family units shall require
site plan approval. Certain other listed uses are also permitted subject
to site plan review. Certain other listed uses require a special permit. In
addition to the permitted individual uses, the PRD Zoning District also
allows a Planned Resort Development (PRD) [see § 310-2.2,
Definitions]. Approval of a PRD requires a special permit from the
Planning Board.
E. General design standards for development within the PRD District.
Development within the PRD District, including mixed-use projects
approved as part of a PRD, shall meet the following general design
standards:

necessary, subsequent stages of investigation, in accordance with
methods and procedures promulgated by the New York State Office
of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
(4) Demographic analysis, identifying the number and type of housing
and guest units to be constructed, the bedroom mix, and the
anticipated year-round and seasonal population, including
schoolchildren, to be generated, utilizing demographic multipliers
derived from the market area which the proposed project will
serve.
(5) Fiscal impact study and the assumptions upon which it is based to
review the estimated municipal and school district costs, including
capital and operating costs, and the services and ratables
anticipated for the development.
I. SEQRA. All applications for a PRD shall be subject to SEQRA. An
application for a new PRD shall be deemed to constitute a Type I action,
which may require the submission of a draft environmental impact
statement (DEIS). The site plan application shall not be deemed
complete until the Town Planning Board has either adopted a negative
declaration under SEQRA or has accepted a DEIS as complete.
J. Project phasing. If the project is to be phased, then a phasing plan shall
be submitted and approved as part of the site plan application. The
Planning Board, as a condition of site plan approval, may require that
the project and ancillary improvements be phased in order to assure
that community services may keep pace with the demands placed on
these services as a result of the PRD development.
K. Conditions. The Planning Board, at its discretion, may attach any
reasonable conditions to site plan approval for a PRD as necessary to
assure conformance of the PRD with the intent and objectives of these
regulations and SEQRA.
L. Site improvements. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for
construction of a Planned Resort Development, or portion thereof, until
the required improvements are installed in accordance with the
approved site plan.

not be disturbed in any way and/or built upon or improved on.
The Planning Board, in its discretion, may require the
vegetative buffer to be supplemented with earthen berms,
trees, shrubs, and additional landscaping to achieve the

Overlay District Standards
§ 310-29.1. Neversink River Overlay District.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this overlay is to protect the quality of habitats,
underlying aquifer, scenic vistas, and open space of the Neversink
River. To this end, these regulations apply to all lands within the
overlay. These regulations further protect the ecological systems
associated with the river. It is well established that impervious surfaces
collect and accumulate pollutants deposited from the atmosphere,
leaked from vehicles or derived from other sources. During storms,
accumulated pollutants are quickly washed off and rapidly delivered to
surface water systems through stormwater runoff. Further, the
Neversink River is utilized by the bald eagle and other species, and land
disturbances in close proximity to the river will degrade habitat for
these species. In order to protect the Neversink River, the following
standards shall apply to any lot within the Neversink River Overlay
District to protect the values of this resource.
B. Applicability. The Neversink River Overlay boundary is defined as
within 300 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of the
river, or the extent of the one-hundred-year AE or A zones as designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, as amended, whichever is greater. These regulations apply to any
development application, wholly or partially located within the overlay
area, that requires site plan, special use permit, or subdivision approval
of the Planning Board. These regulations shall limit the total maximum
lot coverage of any property within the Overlay District. The total lot
coverage shall be the percentage of the lot area within the overlay that
is occupied by the area of buildings, structures and all impermeable
and/or compacted surfaces, including but not limited to roads, parking
lots, access and circulation drives that may be or are proposed to be
located on any lot. The maximum lot coverage shall apply to the
cumulative impervious surfaces shown on any site or subdivision plan,
including roads.
C. Limitation on impervious surface coverage. The maximum lot coverage
of any property within the Overlay District shall be 10%.
D. Conditions. The Planning Board shall attach conditions to its approval
as it deems necessary to achieve the objectives of the Overlay District.
It shall require applicable notes on any map, site plan or subdivision
plan. Such conditions may include the following:
(1) Limiting the total impervious surface area on any lot.
(2) Requiring a conservation easement on land outside a building
envelope.
(3) Reducing the footprint of a proposed structure.
§ 310-29.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-29.1
1:709
§ 310-29.2. O&W Rail Trail Overlay District.
Within the O&W Rail Trail Overlay District (as defined on the Zoning Map),
no disturbance of existing vegetation shall be permitted within 200 feet of
the center line of the rail trail in order to provide a vegetative buffer along
the linear park.
§ 310-29.3. Adult-Oriented Businesses Overlay District.
Adult-oriented business shall be permitted as special uses subject to the
following standards:
(4) Requiring cluster subdivision development.
(5) Reducing the total number of buildings, the area dedicated to
parking, and limiting the length of driveways.
(6) Requiring that buildings and structures be situated on other
portions of the property outside the Overlay District.
(7) Limiting the amount of disturbance of lands within the Overlay
District, and specifically at the edge of the river. Except for
existing, bona fide farming practices in operation as of July 1, 2017,
a minimum one-hundred-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer shall
be retained along the river's shoreline.
(8) Restricting illumination levels, except this condition will not apply
to one-family dwellings.
(9) Other conditions deemed necessary to achieve the objectives of this
section.
A. Overlay zoning district boundary. Shall consist of the following Tax Map
parcels: Tax Map Parcels 25-1-11; 25-1-13; 29-1-3; 6-1-7; 6-1-8; 6-1-9.1;
6-1-9.2; 6-1-11; and 6-1-14.
B. Separation from other uses. Because adult-oriented businesses can
lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities, they
shall also be separated from other uses that could be severely impacted
by their presence or that, in combination with the adult-oriented
business, accentuate the negative impacts on the area. Adult-oriented
businesses therefore shall not be located within 300 feet of any
residence, residential facility, institution, health facility, child-care
center, church, synagogue, school, public or semipublic use, park or
recreation facility, cemetery, or any other establishment which sells
alcoholic beverages. This distance shall be measured in a straight line,
without regard to intervening obstacles, from the nearest portion of the
structure incorporating any aspect of the adult-oriented business to the
nearest property line of the premises incorporating any of the abovelisted
uses.
§ 310-29.1 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-29.3
1:710
§ 310-29.4. State-Designated Agricultural District Overlay District.
C. Sale of alcoholic beverages shall not be permitted at an adult-oriented
business.

business shall be made to identify or portray the type of activity which
occurs at an adult-oriented business excepting for one approved ground
sign not to exceed a surface area of 36 square feet for both sides
combined. Such sign shall be subject to all other limitations applicable
to signs. It shall not incorporate any obscene material but shall
otherwise be unlimited as to message.
E. No nonconforming building or lot shall be used for an adult-oriented
business. No other existing building, lot or use shall be added to,
enlarged, expanded in size or program or converted for purposes of
conducting an adult-oriented business unless application to do so has
been made pursuant to this section and Planning Board approval.
F. Because they are known to encourage prostitution, increase sexual
assaults and attract criminal activity, the following activities shall not
be permitted in any adult-oriented business or any other public place
within the Town of Fallsburg:
(1) Public appearance by a person knowingly or intentionally engaged
in sexual intercourse, deviate sexual conduct or the fondling of the
genitals of him or herself or another person.
(2) The knowing and intentional public appearance of a person in a

female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a fully
opaque covering of any part of the nipple, or the showing of the
covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.
G. No loudspeaker or similar audio equipment used to describe or discuss
specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities shall be audible
beyond the exterior of the structure in which it is located.
A. Overlay Zoning District Boundary. The State-Designated Agricultural
District Overlay shall consist of those parcels designated as part of
Sullivan County Agricultural District Number 4, pursuant to the New
York Agricultural Districts Law, Article 25-QQ of the Agriculture and
Markets Law, as certified on October 15, 2015, or as amended.

shall control within the State-Designated Agricultural District Overlay,
and shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this Zoning Chapter.

structures as to height, scale, size, design, rhythm, setback,
materials, texture, facade treatment and sign location and
treatment. Such information shall be at a scale and of a quality to
enable the Planning Board or ARB to assess the appearance of the
proposed structure(s) and their relationship to their surroundings.
Where necessary for such purposes, the Planning Board or
Architectural Review Board may require perspective renderings or
scale models to be submitted. The above requirements may be
modified by the CEO, Planning Board or the ARB depending on the
nature of the project.
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a renovation or modification
does not require site plan approval, the drawings need not be
prepared by a licensed professional, but must clearly portray the
architectural features to be reviewed. If the proposed project
involves repainting that will change the existing color scheme, the
applicant shall provide an eight-inch-by-ten-inch photo of the
building or structure along with color samples selected from the
Benjamin Moore Historical Color Preview Palette.
(5) A description of all exterior materials. Samples of all exterior
materials and color samples shall be brought to the Planning Board
or ARB meeting.
(6) State environmental quality review compliance. The applicant must
include an environmental assessment form (EAF) and any other
necessary documentation to comply with SEQR (such as a EAF
visual assessment addendum), unless a lead agency other than the
ARB is designated. No application shall be considered complete
until a negative declaration has been issued by the lead agency.
A. The Planning Board or ARB shall review the exterior architectural
features of the proposed construction, additions, alterations or
remodeling, and evaluate them in accordance with the adopted
guidelines set forth in the Architectural and Building Form Guidelines,
as such may be amended from time to time.
B. The Planning Board or Architectural Review Board shall give strong
consideration to architectural design and aesthetic considerations,
including architectural elevations, facade treatments, building exterior
§ 310-30.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-30.4
1:717
§ 310-30.5. Findings and decision of Planning Board or ARB.
finish and ornamentation, signage, windows, and lighting, in order
to convey an attractive appearance and to help restore the hamlet
centers to an appearance consistent with that promoted by the design
guidelines. For both new structures and replacements, renovations
and alterations, the appearance, color, material, texture, and design
of structures, including roof pitch and building mass, and the size,
shape, location and number of window and door openings shall be
reviewed by the Planning Board or Architectural Review Board as to
their consistency with the Architectural and Building Form Guidelines
and to their compatibility with adjacent buildings so as to avoid
unnecessary or inappropriate contrast with surrounding structures.
C. The Planning Board or Architectural Review Board may seek
architectural review input and advice on the applicant's submission
from an architect, engineer or other professional as it deems necessary.
The applicant shall be required to establish an escrow account, in an
amount to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Board
or ARB, for the purpose of covering the Town's cost for said consulting
services.
D. In exercising its authority, the Planning Board or ARB shall consider
costs of materials, availability of materials, and the needs and
objectives of the project sponsor. The Planning Board or ARB shall make
every reasonable effort to find a means of achieving the applicant's
goals in conformance with the purposes of this article. Where the
Planning Board or ARB has objections to a proposal, it shall make every
effort to work with the applicant in developing an economically feasible
plan to address any objections.
A. Authority of the Board. The Planning Board or ARB may either approve,
approve subject to specific modifications or submission of additional
data or material, or disapprove the proposed exterior architectural
features of the construction, additions, alterations or remodeling.
B. Approval. Approval shall be based upon a finding that the proposed
construction, additions, alterations or remodeling meets the adopted
guidelines set forth in the Architectural Review and Building Form
Guidelines, if applicable.
C. Approval subject to modifications. Approval with modifications shall be
based on a finding that the exterior architectural features of the
proposed construction, additions, alterations or remodeling would meet
the guidelines set forth in the Architectural and Building Form
Guidelines if certain modifications were made, or that the Planning
Board or ARB requires additional data or material to grant approval to
the proposed project. The findings shall set forth the specific
modifications necessary to meet such guidelines, and/or the specific
data or material required to satisfy the Board's requirements.
§ 310-30.4 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-30.5
1:718
D. Disapproval. Disapproval shall be based on a finding that one or more
exterior architectural features fail to meet the guidelines of the
Architectural and Building Form Guidelines, and cannot be altered to
meet such guidelines by one or more particular modifications.
Disapproval may also be made if the applicant has failed to submit
reasonably necessary elevations, renderings, samples or specifications
sufficient to enable the Board to review the application.
E. Coordination with Planning Board on site plan reviews.
(1) The ARB is not required to hold a separate public hearing on the
application for architectural approval. However, during the
Planning Board hearing, the public is entitled to comment on any
issues relating to the architectural elements of the site plan, and
any such comments shall be noted in the minutes and immediately
transmitted by the Planning Board Secretary to the Architectural
Review Board.
(2) The ARB shall promptly submit comments to the Planning Board
concerning the visual impact issues and any other environmental
issues relating to the architectural features. Where practicable, the
ARB may also forward informal comments to the Planning Board on
any review that the ARB has undertaken. All such comments should
be submitted to the Planning Board prior to the close of the public
hearing.
F. Time for decision.
(1) The Planning Board or ARB shall not issue a final decision on the
application until after the close of any Planning Board public
hearing on the site plan, so that any public comments may be
transmitted, and a negative declaration or SEAR findings have
been issued by the Planning Board as lead agency, or until the ARB
has made its own SEQR determination, if there is an uncoordinated
review or the action is not subject to Planning Board review.
(2) The ARB shall render its decision within 31 days after the close of
the public hearing on the site plan, for projects that also require
site plan review. The Planning Board shall render its decision
pursuant to the required time periods of Article VI or VII of this
chapter, or of Chapter 260, Subdivision of Land, as applicable to
the review of the project. Where the project does not require site
plan review or Planning Board approval, the ARB shall act within
62 days of referral of the full application, including architectural
elevations. If the applicant does not submit reasonably necessary
elevations or other reasonably necessary documents at the outset,
the sixty-two-day period shall not begin to run until such elevations
and other documents are submitted.
G. Filing of decision. The decision of the Planning Board or ARB shall be
filed in the office of the Town Clerk within 10 business days after such
decision is rendered, and a copy thereof mailed to the applicant.
§ 310-30.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 310-30.5
1:719
§ 310-30.6. Effect of decision.
§ 310-30.7. Necessity for further review and approval.
If at any time, either before or after the issuance of a building permit,
operating permit, seasonal operating permit or certificate of occupancy,
the applicant proposes to change any element of the Planning Board or
ARB's approval of architectural features, including change in design, color,
texture, material, addition or deletion of architectural elements, or any
changes to the building footprint, then the applicant shall submit a request
for modification of the Planning Board or ARB approval to the Code
Enforcement Officer, who shall immediately forward it to the Planning
Board or ARB Chair. The review for a modification shall generally follow
the same procedures as above, but the Code Enforcement Officer and the
Planning Board or ARB shall make every effort to expedite the review.
Nothing herein shall exempt an applicant from obtaining an amended site
H. Expiration of approval. Planning Board or ARB architectural review
approval shall expire one year from the date of approval, unless an
extension is granted by the Planning Board or ARB at the request of the
applicant prior to the expiration. Only one six-month extension shall be
permitted. When recommendations are made by the ARB upon referral
from the Planning Board, the expiration of approval will be at the
discretion of the Planning Board.
A. The Code Enforcement Officer shall not issue any permit, including a
building permit, seasonal operating permit, operating permit or a
certificate of occupancy, for any construction, additions, alterations or
remodeling, the architectural features of which have not been
approved, or which have been disapproved by the Planning Board or
ARB. The Code Enforcement Officer may approve a building permit for
proposed construction, additions, alterations or remodeling
conditionally approved by the Planning Board or ARB, or grant a
seasonal operating permit, as soon as the conditions specified in such
conditional approval have been fulfilled, provided that the proposed
construction, additions, alterations or remodeling otherwise qualifies
for a building permit. The Code Enforcement Officer may issue a
building permit for proposed construction, additions, alterations or
remodeling approved by the Planning Board or ARB, provided that it
otherwise qualifies for a building permit. The Code Enforcement Officer
shall issue a building permit for proposed construction, additions,
alterations or remodeling which have been referred to the Planning
Board or ARB for review and on which the Board has failed to act within
the time periods set forth in the preceding section, provided that the
proposed construction, additions, alterations or remodeling otherwise
qualifies for a building permit.
B. Where the proposed project or construction requires site plan approval,
the Planning Board Chair shall not sign the site plan until the ARB has
issued an approval, or approval subject to conditions, if applicable.
§ 310-30.5 FALLSBURG CODE § 310-30.7
1:720
plan approval, if amended site plan approval is required. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall not issue any permits, including building permits,
seasonal operating permits, operating permits or certificates of occupancy,
for construction, additions, alterations or remodeling which includes
exterior architectural features other than those approved by the Planning
Board or ARB, until an amended approval has been obtained to authorize
the change.
§ 310-30.8. Court review.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Board, Architectural
Review Board, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the Town, may
apply to the Supreme Court for review by a proceeding under Article 78
of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. Such proceedings shall be instituted
within 30 days after the filing of a decision by the Board in the office of the
Town Clerk, as further provided in Town Law § 274-a, Subdivision 11.
§ 310-30.9. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
A. No building permit, seasonal operating permit, operating permit or
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the applicant shows
compliance with this article.
B. No construction shall take place except as approved by the Planning
Board or ARB pursuant to the provisions of this article.
C. Any person or corporation who violates this article, or who engages in
construction without obtaining the required approval of the Planning
Board, Architectural Review Board or Code Enforcement Officer as
required in this article, or who engages in construction contrary to the
provisions and conditions of the Planning Board or ARB approval, or
any person who uses or operates a business in any building or structure
constructed in violation of the provisions or conditions of any Planning
Board or ARB approval or building permit as required by this article
shall be liable, upon conviction, to be fined up to $500 for each offense.
Each and every week that such violation continues shall constitute a
separate offense.
D. Nothing in this article shall be construed as depriving the Town or the
Town Board of any other available remedy, either of a civil or criminal
nature, as provided by law.
