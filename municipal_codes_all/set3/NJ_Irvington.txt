will be added to the payable amount.
(d) A DMV fee of $3 is also to be added to the total payable amount
due upon the issuance of an order to suspend.
§ 1-19 IRVINGTON CODE § 1-20
1:14
(e) When a warrant is issued, unless the judge otherwise orders,
the amount of the bail indicated on the warrant shall be as
follows:
[1] Parking offenses: the payable amount plus $15.
[2] All other listed offenses: the payable amount plus $25.
(f) Note: Under the provision of N.J.S.A. 39:5-9, costs, not to
exceed $33, may be deducted by the court from forfeited bail in
traffic cases.
(2) Nontraffic cases. For offenses listed in Part II of this Schedule,
N.J.S.A. 2B:12-31 permits the Municipal Court to order the
suspension of a defendant's driving privilege for failure to appear
at any scheduled court appearance. The following procedures may
be used by the court to effectuate that process:
(a) Send a "Notice of Proposed Suspension of Driving Privileges
for Failure to Appear" to the defendant. This notice may be
used for violations that are payable on this Schedule, as well as
for those violations that are not. Note: Unlike traffic matters,
no fee may be assessed for the mailing of this notice.
(b) Should the defendant fail to respond to the notice of proposed
suspension, the court may issue an order of suspension. When
the court issues the order, $25 [$10 (notice) + $15 (order)] will
be added to the total payable amount.
(c) A DMV fee of $3 is also to be added to the payable amount,
upon the issuance of the order of suspension.
(d) When a warrant is issued, unless the judge otherwise orders,
the amount of the bail indicated on the warrant shall be the
amount of the payable amount plus $50.
B. Appearance of defendant in certain cases. If, in the opinion of the officer
issuing the complaint-summons, circumstances indicate that the
defendant should appear in court, the officer has the option to check
the "Court Appearance Required" box on the complaint-summons, in
which case the matter may not be processed in the Violations Bureau.
C. Authorization to apply bail against fine(s) and costs. By executing the
form of Authorization to Apply Bail against Fine(s) and Cost and Waiver
of Rights, a defendant against whom a warrant has been issued waives
the rights to a lawyer and a trial, enters a plea of guilty to the offense
charged and authorizes the Municipal Court Administrator to apply the
bail posted toward the payment of fines, assessments and costs owed.
This form may be used for all offenses payable through the Violations
Bureau.
D. Defense by affidavit in certain cases. For any offense not listed on this
Schedule or on a local schedule, a court appearance is required, unless
§ 1-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1-20
1:15
the court authorizes a defendant by affidavit in accordance with the
provisions of New Jersey Court Rule 7:12-3. For offenses involving
traffic accidents resulting in personal injury, a court appearance is also
required.

option, shall be permitted to accept police-related employment for
private employers, who are separate and independent from the
Township of Irvington, only during off-duty hours and at such time
as will not interfere with the efficient performance of regularly
scheduled or emergency duty of the Township.
(2) Any person or entity wishing to employ off-duty police shall first
obtain the approval of the Director of Public Safety or his or her
designee, which approval shall be granted if, in the opinion of the
Director of Public Safety or his or her designee, such employment
is necessary and would not be inconsistent with the efficient
functioning and good reputation of the Police Division and would
not unreasonably endanger or threaten the safety of the officer or
officers who are to perform the work.
B. Trust account.
(1) To assure the timely payment of wages to police officers who
perform off-duty services, and to meet the requirements of the Fair
Labor Standards Act,29 the Township of Irvington has established a
trust fund known as the "Outside Employment for Police Officers
Trust Account," which trust fund is dedicated for the receipt of fees
collected from private persons or entities for payment to police
officers for off-duty or outside employment services. The Outside
Employment for Police Officers Trust Account shall be
administered by the Department of Revenue and Finance of the
Township of Irvington, which shall make a report to the Township
Council every 90 days regarding said account.
(2) Any person or entity requesting the services of an off-duty law
enforcement officer in the Township of Irvington shall estimate the
number of hours such law enforcement services are required,
which estimate shall be approved in writing by the Director of
Public Safety, or his or her designee, and upon the Director's
approval, a copy of said approval shall be forwarded to the Jobs in
Blue Office of the Township of Irvington. The person or entity
requesting the services shall then forward payment for services for
the total estimated hours of service, the rates of compensation and
administrative fees as set forth in § 7-151D to the Jobs in Blue
Office which, upon review, will forward to the Department of
Revenue and Finance for deposit in a trust account within the
Outside Employment for Police Officers Trust Account.

and cannot be reasonably estimated, or is anticipated to be in
excess of 10 days, the person or entity requesting the services of an
off-duty law enforcement officer shall deposit an amount sufficient

in § 7-151D for the equivalent of 10 days prior to the
commencement of any work. Any unused portion of the deposit
shall be returned or credited against the final amount owed.
(4) Prior to posting any request for services of off-duty law
enforcement officers, the Director of Public Safety or his or her
designee shall verify that the balance in the trust account of the
person or entity requesting services is sufficient to cover the
compensation and fees for the number of hours specified in the
request for services. The Director of Public Safety or his or her
designee shall not post a request for services from any person or
entity unless all fees and compensation required in the manner
described above have been deposited in the Off-Duty Employment

directly to the Township for said account. No officer shall be paid
directly by any employer for requested services nor provide any
such services for more hours than are specified in the request for
services.
(5) In the event the funds in such a trust account should become
depleted, services of off-duty law enforcement officers shall cease,
and further requests for further or future services shall not be
performed or posted until additional funds have been deposited in
the trust account in the manner prescribed above. In the event of
an unforeseen emergency situation that would require an officer to
remain beyond the time for which funds have been posted, the
Director of Public Safety or his or her designee may waive the
requirement for posting additional funds after the first 10 hours for
any person or entity exhibiting a previous satisfactory payment
history. However, the person or entity requiring the extended
service within 48 hours shall make payment for the additional
hours.
(6) The person or entity requesting such services shall be responsible
for ensuring that sufficient funds remain in the trust account in
order to avoid any interruption of services.
(7) Exemption. All public utility companies that are under the
jurisdiction of, and regulated by, the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities, and state, county and other quasi-government agencies
will be exempt from the provisions set forth in this section
requiring advance payment to the trust account; provided,
however, that there are no amounts previously due that are
outstanding for a period in excess of 30 days. Any such delinquent
balances shall require advance payment of the amount outstanding
prior to any officer engaging in any further off-duty assignments.

§ 91-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as "An ordinance banning the use of
government buildings and government equipment for political fundraising."
§ 91-2. Findings and purpose.
A. Findings.
(1) Political contributions have a profound impact on government
decisionmaking; and
(2) Our laws in New Jersey do not presently ban solicitation or
acceptance of contribution by public office holders and employees
while on public property or by use of public facilities; and
(3) A conflict may arise between the business of political fund-raising
and the business of government in Town Hall and other
government-owned premises, and this may cause a distraction from
the people's business; and
§ 49-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 91-2
1:155
§ 91-3. Definitions.

all pledges or other commitments or assumptions of liability to make any
such transfer. Contributions shall be deemed to have been made upon the
date when such commitment is made or liability assumed.
MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL, EMPLOYEE AND APPOINTEE  Any person
holding elective municipal office or holding an appointed position in the
municipal government, or in any agency, commission, board, or office

municipal or school board office. "Political organization" includes, but is not
limited to, organizations otherwise defined as "political committee," "joint
candidates committee," and "legislative leadership committee."
PROPERTY OF THE MUNICIPALITY  Buildings, land, vehicles, phones, fax
machines, computers or other office equipment or supplies and other real

for public roads and open park land.
SOLICIT  To seek by oral or written communication a contribution as same
is defined herein.
§ 91-4. Prohibited actions.
(4) The most appropriate method to prevent this conflict and to ensure
the integrity of government decisions is the prohibition of political
fund-raising on or by use of public property.
B. Therefore, it is accordingly found and determined that the paramount
public interest in a clean and accountable government requires the
prohibition of political fund-raising on public property or by use of
public facilities.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 114-1. Policy.
The Township of Irvington expressly prohibits any form of sexual
harassment. Improper interference with the ability of employees to perform
their expected job duties will not be tolerated. It is Township of Irvington
policy that all employees have a right to work in an environment free of
discrimination, which encompasses freedom from sexual harassment. The
Township of Irvington strongly disapproves of sexual harassment of its
employees, in any form, and states that all employees at all levels of the
Township of Irvington must avoid offensive or inappropriate sexual and/
or sexually harassing behavior at work and will be held responsible for
ensuring that the workplace is free from sexual harassment.
§ 114-2. Responsibility.
The Township of Irvington strongly disapproves of and does not tolerate
sexual harassment of any kind. It is the responsibility of each supervisor
to create an atmosphere free from sexual harassment and to communicate
the Township of Irvington's policy on this subject to all subordinates, to
promptly investigate complaints and to take corrective action as necessary.
It is the responsibility of each employee of the Township to respect the
rights of coworkers. All employees must avoid offensive or inappropriate
sexual behavior at work and are responsible for assuring that the workplace
is free from sexual harassment at all times.
§ 114-3. Guidelines.
The Township of Irvington policy prohibits unwelcome sexual advances;
requests for sexual acts or favors with or without accompanying promises,
threats or reciprocal favors or actions; or other verbal or physical conduct
of a sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of adversely affecting
an employee's performance or which creates a hostile or offensive working
environment. Examples of prohibited conduct include but are not limited
to lewd or sexually suggestive comments; off-color language or jokes of
a sexual nature; commentary about an individual's body; slurs and other
verbal, graphic or physical conduct relating to an individual's sex; or any
display of sexually explicit pictures, greeting cards, articles, comic books,
magazines, photos or cartoons. Such behavior and displays are prohibited
anywhere in the Township of Irvington, including locker rooms and
bathrooms, and in any public place, including any off-duty encounters
among Township of Irvington employees.
§ 114-4. Complaint procedure.
The Township of Irvington will endeavor to investigate all complaints as
expeditiously and as professionally as possible. Where investigations
§ 110-10 IRVINGTON CODE § 114-4
1:176
confirm the allegations, appropriate corrective action will be taken. The
Township of Irvington will make every attempt to maintain the information
provided to it in the complaint and investigation process as confidentially as
possible. Any employee who has a complaint of sexual harassment at work
by anyone, including supervisors, coworkers or visitors, should immediately
bring the problem to the attention of his or her immediate supervisor.
If the complaint involves supervisory personnel in the employee's line of
command, then the complaint should be brought to the Business
Administrator. All complaints should be in writing and should specify the
acts of sexual harassment complained of. As part of its investigation, the
Township of Irvington will conduct interviews with all relevant persons,
including the complainant, the accused and other potential witnesses. The
Township of Irvington will review its findings with the complainant at
the conclusion of its investigation. If the investigation reveals that the
complaint appears to be valid, immediate and appropriate corrective action,
up to and including seeking a discharge, will be taken to stop the
harassment and prevent its recurrence. If the validity of the complaint
cannot be determined, immediate and appropriate action will be taken to
assure that all parties are reacquainted with the sexual harassment policy
so as to prevent sexual harassment in the future.
§ 114-5. Retaliation.
There will be no retaliation against employees for reporting sexual
harassment or assisting the Township of Irvington in the investigation of a
complaint. However, if after investigating any complaint of harassment or
unlawful discrimination the Township of Irvington learns that the complaint
is not bona fide or that an employee has provided false information
regarding the complaint, disciplinary action may be taken against the
individual who provided the false information.
§ 114-6. Distribution of policy.
A copy of the sexual harassment policy will be distributed to all Township
employees and will be posted in a prominent place in the Irvington
Municipal Building.

Rehabilitation
[Adopted 5-4-2004 by Ord. No. MC 3262 (Ch. 51, Art. I, of the 1981
Revised Code)]
§ 140-1. Abandoned property defined.
An "abandoned property" is hereby defined as one that has not been legally
occupied for a period of six months and meets one of the following criteria:
§ 140-2. Procedures for Township's acquisition of abandoned
property. [Amended 3-13-2018 by Ord. No. MC 3635]
The procedures for the Township's acquisition of the abandoned property
shall be that which is set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. (P.L. 2003, Ch.
210). This shall include the filing of a complaint in the Superior Court of
New Jersey with a certification by the public officer that the property is
abandoned. Thirty days' notice must be provided to the owner prior to the
filing of a complaint.
§ 140-3. Rehabilitation plan.
The owner may defend against the complaint by submitting a plan for
the rehabilitation and reuse of the property and by posting a bond equal
to 125% of the amount determined by the public officer (Business
Administrator or his designee) to represent the projected cost of
rehabilitation. The plan requires a financial feasibility analysis, a budget
and timetable for rehabilitation of the property and documentation of
qualifications of those who will perform the rehabilitation.
A. The property is in need of rehabilitation and has not been rehabilitated
during the unoccupied period;
B. Construction has been initiated on the property in the past, but not for
the six-month period;
C. The property has been in tax arrearage for at least one installment
period; or
D. The property has been determined to be a nuisance by the Business
Administrator, the Construction Official, the Health Officer, the Fire
Subcode Official, the Director of Housing Services or other public
official charged with condemnation responsibilities and granted the
appropriate authority (nuisance includes a finding that the property is
unfit for human habitation and/or is determined to be a fire hazard or
potential health and safety hazard). [Amended 7-14-2009 by Ord.
No. MC 3407; 7-1-2014 by Ord. No. MC 3511]
§ 140-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 140-4
1:187
§ 140-4. Rehabilitation plan approval.
The Court shall approve the plan if the plan is realistic and likely to
result in the expeditious rehabilitation and reuse of the property and,
correspondingly, the Court shall disapprove of the plan if unrealistic. If the
Court approves the owner's plan, it may appoint the Business Administrator
to act as monitor of the owner's compliance. If the owner fails to carry
out any step in the approved plan, the Business Administrator officer shall
notify the Court, which may order the bond forfeit, grant the Township
possession of the property, and authorize the Township to use the proceeds
of the bond for rehabilitation of the property.
§ 140-5. Quarterly progress reports required.
The owner shall provide quarterly reports to the Township and the Court on
the owner's progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property.
§ 140-6. Alternate entities for implementation of rehabilitation
plan.
If an owner fails to successfully defend against a complaint, a mortgage
holder or lien holder may seek to be designated in possession for the
property by submitting a plan and posting a bond meeting the same
conditions described above. If no mortgage holder or lien holder meets
these conditions, the Township of Irvington shall submit a plan which shall
designate an entity that shall implement the plan. This entity may be the
Township or a qualified rehabilitation entity, organized or authorized to do
business under New Jersey law, which shall have as one of its purposes the
construction or rehabilitation of residential or nonresidential buildings, the
provision of affordable housing and the restoration of abandoned property,
among others.
§ 140-7. Possession of property by Township.
If the Township of Irvington is granted possession of a property under this
article, the Township shall be deemed to have an ownership interest in the
property for the purpose of filing plans with public agencies and any state
program of grants or loans. Where the Township borrows funds for the
express purpose of rehabilitating the property, the Court may authorize the
Township to grant a lien or security interest with priority over all other liens
or mortgages other than Township liens.
§ 140-8. Owner responsibilities while under Township possession.
With the granting of possession by the Court to the Township of a property
determined to be abandoned, the owner shall continue to be responsible
for all taxes or other municipal liens and charges, or mortgages or liens
to any party, incurred on the property, whether those taxes, charges or
liens are incurred before or after the granting of possession; nor shall the
owner be relieved of any operating or maintenance expense associated
with the property. Similarly, although the Township is required to maintain,
§ 140-4 IRVINGTON CODE § 140-8
1:188
safeguard, and maintain insurance on the property, the owner shall not be
relieved of any civil or criminal liability or any duty imposed by reason of
acts or omissions of the owner relating to the property.
§ 140-9. Township authorized to seek approval to assign rights to
another entity.
The Township is authorized to seek Court approval to assign its rights to
another entity, which may be granted under the circumstances enumerated
in this article.
§ 140-10. Reinstatement of owner's rights.
An owner may petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and
possession of the property. The petition's requirements and conditions shall
be determined by the Court for reinstating the owner's rights.
§ 140-11. Township sale of property.
If the Township sells the property, this article sets forth the order of
distribution of the proceeds of such a sale. This article authorizes the
Business Administrator, with the approval of the Court, to place a lien on
the property to cover any costs the Township incurred prior to the granting
by the Court of an order of possession, which may include costs incurred to
stabilize or secure the property.
§ 140-12. Special tax sales.
This article authorizes the Township of Irvington to hold special tax sales
with respect to those properties eligible for tax sale under N.J.S.A. 54:5-19
which are also on an abandoned property list and sets forth procedures
governing those special tax sales. In the case of any eminent domain
proceeding carried out under Section 37 of P.L. 1996, c. 62 (N.J.S.A.
55:19-56), this article establishes the parameters for establishing fair
market value.

via the Animal Control Officer(s) to resolve any complaints over the

properly managing the colonies. As part of this requirement, caretakers
must:
(1) Feed only during daylight hours;
(2) Feed only the amount of food required by the cats in the colony;
(3) Leave food out for a maximum of one hour per feeding, no more
than twice per day, which shall mean removing all food dishes after

days.
§ 167-37. Disposition of colony cats.

location where the cat was captured. The caretaker shall have up to three
business days to arrange for the cat to be retrieved from the temporary
animal holding facility identified by the Animal Control Officer.

(2) Investigate any nuisance complaint allegedly caused by a feral or
stray cat or feral cat colony.

does not correct the situation within 30 days of being given written
notice by the Township delineating the caretaker's failures with

Officer(s) may investigate any nuisance complaint. If an Animal Control
Officer determines that an ear-tipped feral colony cat is causing a
nuisance as defined by this article and the caretaker fails to resolve the
nuisance or remove the cat within 30 days, the Animal Control Officer
may remove the cat. If an Animal Control Officer reasonably determines
that a cat is injured or poses a significant threat to public health, the
Officer may reduce the time that the caretaker has to resolve the
complaint, as necessary to protect the cat and public health, before
taking further action. In the case of an emergency, the Animal Control
Officer or a law enforcement officer may remove the cat, but within 24
hours the Township must provide the caretaker with notice of the cat's
whereabouts and allow the caretaker an opportunity to retrieve the cat
for treatment, return, or relocation.

purpose of complying with the requirements of the article. Individuals

surrendering the cats for impoundment. The Township reserves the
right to collect a deposit on all traps loaned to caretakers as part of
this program, in accordance with rental procedures established by the
Department of Health.
B. This section shall not apply to:

their employment contract; or
(2) Any individual trying to recover his or her own lost cat through
trapping on his or her own property or with permission of the

condition; an employee's need for medical diagnosis, care, or

for a family member when it has been determined by the health
authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider that the
family member's presence in the community would jeopardize the
health of others because of the family member's exposure to a
communicable disease, whether or not the family member has
actually contracted the communicable disease.
B. Nothing in this article prohibits an employer from requesting that an
employee confirm, in writing, following use of paid sick time, that the
paid sick time was used for an authorized purpose under this article.
C. Where the need to use paid sick time is foreseeable, an employer may
require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use paid sick time.

is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide

employee's work shift or work day or, in cases such as emergencies
where advance notice is not possible, notice shall be provided by the
employee as soon as practicable.

paid sick time, that the employee search for or find a replacement
worker to cover the hours during which the employee is absent.
E. The employer shall determine whether paid sick time may be used in
increments of less than one day.
F. After an employee has used paid sick time for three consecutive days or
three consecutive instances (in cases where the employer determined
that paid sick time could be used in increments of less than one day), an
employer may require an employee to provide reasonable
documentation that the time has been used for a purpose covered by
Subsection A. In this instance, the employer may require
documentation signed by a health care professional indicating that the
paid sick time was necessary; however, an employer may not require
that the documentation explain the nature of the illness.

attempt to exercise, any right protected under this article.

has properly exercised rights protected under this article.
A. All employers shall give written notice to each employee at the
commencement of the employee's employment (or as soon as
practicable if the employee is already employed on the effective date of
this law) regarding employee's rights under this article. Such notice
shall describe the right to paid sick time, the accrual rate and the
amount of paid sick time, and the terms of its use under this article; the
right to be free from retaliation for properly requesting use of paid sick
time; and the right to file a complaint or bring an action in Municipal
Court if paid sick time is denied by the employer or the employee is
retaliated against for requesting or taking paid sick time. Such notice
shall be in English and the primary language spoken by that employee,
so long as the primary language of that employee is also the primary
language of at least 10% of the employer's workforce.
B. Employers shall also display a poster in a conspicuous and accessible
place in each business establishment where employees are employed

Employers shall allow the agency reasonable access to records and to
monitor compliance with the requirements of this article. An employer's
failure to maintain or retain adequate records documenting hours worked

paid or unpaid, or that extends other protections to employees.
A. An employer may not require disclosure of the specific details relating
to an employee's or an employee's family member's medical condition
as a condition of providing paid sick time under this article. If an
employer possesses health information about an employee or
employee's family member, such information shall be treated as
confidential and shall not be disclosed by the employer except to the
affected employee or with the permission of the affected employee.

Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
§ 313-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Municipal Council of the Township of
Irvington, of New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 313-2. Findings of fact.
§ 313-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of Irvington are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of
the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
§ 313-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-3
1:377
§ 313-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

relocated portion of said watercourse so the flood-carrying capacity
is not diminished.
E. Interpretation of DFIRM/FIRM boundaries. The Township Engineer
shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in § 313-15.
A. Appeal board.
§ 313-14 IRVINGTON CODE § 313-15
1:386
(1) The Planning Board as established by the Township of Irvington

alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Township Engineer in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
(3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Board, or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Essex County Superior
Court, as provided in the applicable law.
(4) In passing upon such applications, the Planning Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
§ 313-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-15
1:387
(5) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection A(4) and the
purposes of this chapter, the Planning Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The Township Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances
to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided
Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) has been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

ARTICLE V
Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
§ 313-16. General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:
A. Anchoring.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure.
(2) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
B. Construction materials and methods.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
C. Utilities.
(1) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(2) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharge from the systems into floodwaters;
(3) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
and
(4) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
D. Subdivision proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
§ 313-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-16
1:389
§ 313-17. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in § 313-7, Basis for establishing areas of special
flood hazard, or in § 313-14B, Use of other base flood and floodway data, the
following standards are required:
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at least
50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).
E. Enclosure openings. All new construction and substantial
improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped
with screens, louvers, or other covering or devices, provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
A. Residential construction.
(1) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to or above base flood elevation.
(2) Within any AO Zone on the municipality's DFIRM/FIRM, all new
construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified). Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures shall
be required.
B. Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
§ 313-16 IRVINGTON CODE § 313-17
1:390
§ 313-18. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 313-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with the
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, shall:
(1) Require within any AO Zone on the municipality's DFIRM/FIRM
that all new construction and substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall
either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above
the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);
and require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures;
or
(2) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
(3) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(4) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable
provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to
the official as set forth in § 313-14C(2).
C. Manufactured homes.
(1) Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
§ 313-16A(2).
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at or
above the base flood elevation.
A. Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, are prohibited unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in
any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
B. If Subsection A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with Article V, Provisions for Flood Hazard
Reduction.
§ 313-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-18
1:391
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 foot at any
point.

by Trap-Zap of South Norwalk, Connecticut), or Zurn Industries (Dallas,
Texas). See Diagram A attached.171
D. The following design method has been developed and recommended for
use by the NJDEP. The Township has elected to adopt this method for all
future grease trap sizing, with the exceptions noted below.
(1) Restaurants:
(D) x (GL) x (HR/2) x (LF) = size of grease trap in gallons
Where:
D = Number of seats in dining area
GL = Gallons of wastewater per meal (5 gallons/EPA)
ST = Storage capacity factor
Minimum 1.7
Maximum 2.5
HR = Number of hours open
LF = Loading factor
1.25 Interstate freeway
1.0 Other freeways
1.0 Recreational areas
0.8 Main highways
0.5 Other highways
(2) Hospitals, nursing homes, take-out restaurants, and establishments
with varied seating capacity:
(M) x (GL) x (ST) x (2.5) x (LF) = size of grease trap in gallons
Where:
M = Meals per day
GL = Gallons of wastewater per meal (4.5 gallon/EPA)
171. Editor's Note: Said diagram is on file in the Township offices.
§ 324-26 IRVINGTON CODE § 324-26
1:412
ST = Storage capacity factor
Minimum 1.7
Maximum 2.5
LF = Loading factor
1.25 garbage disposal and dishwasher
1.0 without garbage disposal
0.75 without dishwashing
(3) Other oil- or grease-producing establishments. Review by the
Township of other grease-producing establishments will be based
on submitted data and required pretreatment to meet the effluent
standards.
E. Exceptions to the above requirements will be considered on written
request to the Township where the above formulae require a grease
trap in excess of 1,000 gallons. In this regard, the Township will permit
the following:
(1) The Township will permit the trial installation of a single external
1,000 gallon grease trap for restaurants seating less than 100
persons, except for restaurants known to produce exceptional
quantities of grease and oil.
(2) The Township will permit the trial installation of two external 1,000
gallon grease traps in series, for restaurants seating more than 100
persons, or for restaurants known to produce exceptional
quantities of grease and oil.
F. It is the establishment owner's obligation to meet the discharge
concentration standards for oil and grease set forth in other sections of
these regulations. If subsequent tests show that the discharge
concentration standard is not being met, then the above-described
design method shall apply, and additional grease trap capacity shall be
furnished.
G. Additional requirements are as follows:
(1) The grease trap(s) shall be placed at a distance from the structure
sufficient to permit cooling and coagulation of oil and grease within
the grease trap.
(2) Piping must be arranged so that only kitchen wastes and kitchen
floor drains are tributary to the grease traps. Bathroom facilities
and all other waste outlets must bypass the grease traps.
(3) Cleanouts must be provided between the building and the grease
traps, between grease traps in series, and (as a sampling point)
downstream of the last grease trap.
§ 324-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 324-26
1:413
§ 324-27. Grease trap maintenance.
(4) The trap openings must be extended to the surface, using minimum
twenty-four-inch diameter barrels, and topped with a standard
manhole frame and cover.
(5) Every installation shall be reviewed for uplift resistance, with
groundwater assumed to be at the surface.
H. Installation of grease traps shall meet the recommendations of the
Plumbing and Drainage Institute, including locations, flow control and
venting. Grease trap installation will also require a plumbing permit
and compliance with municipal plumbing code regulations. Sampling
manholes for food service establishments shall be installed downstream
of the grease trap, but upstream of any interconnection with bathroom
sanitary service lines.
A. Each grease-producing establishment shall submit a grease trap
maintenance program to the Township for approval prior to
construction. The frequency of grease removal is dependent upon the
capacity of the interceptor and the quantity of grease in the
wastewater. Maintenance intervals may vary from once a week to once
in several weeks, but in no event less than once monthly. When the
grease removal interval has been determined for a specific installation,
regular cleaning at that interval is necessary to maintain the rated
efficiency of the interceptor. After the accumulated grease and waste
material has been removed, the interceptor should be checked to make
sure that the inlet, outlet and air relief ports are clear of obstructions
such as solidified grease.
B. Records must be kept of all maintenance on grease traps. The record
must be available for inspection by Township representatives, upon
request, during normal business hours. The record shall include the
following information: date, time, description of work done, comments
on the additional work needed, quantity of grease removed and names
of personnel performing the work. Any establishment which fails to
provide such records or provides inadequate records shall be subject to
a penalty and/or termination of service.

make repairs or otherwise improve his property and is unable to comply
with this chapter without having right of access to the building or
premises through or across adjoining premises not owned by him or
under his control, and where the right of access has been refused the

undue hardship upon the developer of such property,
grant, upon an application or an appeal relating to

granted. The Board may grant such relief only

do not require the building or structure to abut a
street. The Board shall impose requirements or
conditions that will provide adequate access for
firefighting equipment, ambulances and other
emergency vehicles necessary for the protection
of health and safety and will protect any future
street layout shown on the Official Map or on the

G. Review of escrow deposit amount. [Added 9-12-2017 by Ord. No. MC
3616]
(1) Prior to making a determination of completeness upon any
application, the Board shall review said application to determine
whether the escrow amount set forth above is sufficient. If the
amount set forth is determined insufficient by the reviewing board
to cover professional costs anticipated for the application,
additional funds in the amount of 33 1/3% of the initially required
escrow fee shall be deposited by the applicant prior to declaring
the application complete. The application shall not be declared

interest earned thereon, except as otherwise provided for herein, shall

the municipality. Money deposited shall be held in escrow. The
municipality shall deposit it in a banking institution or savings and loan

was deposited, as the case may be; except that the municipality will
retain for administrative expenses a sum equivalent to no more than

Planning Board or Board of Adjustment. The applicant shall be
responsible for any costs incurred by the Planning Board or the Board
of Adjustment in having its professional and administrative staff
prepare an accounting of the fees expended. Such additional amount as
may be required for said accounting shall be paid to the Planning Board
or Board of Adjustment prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy in

accounting. [Added 9-12-2017 by Ord. No. MC 3616]

repairs, the lessee shall be considered in such cases as the "owner" for the
purpose of this article.
RATPROOFING or RATPROOFED  A form of construction that prevents
the ingress and egress of rats from one place to another. It consists of

§ 449-16. Adoption of policy.
The Township does hereby adopt Integrated Pest Management as the pest
control policy and strategy to be employed in the maintenance of the
Township's public properties and facilities.
A. It is the desire of the Mayor and Council of the Township of Irvington to
promote matters which benefit the health, welfare, comfort and safety
of the citizens of the community.
B. Scientific studies associate exposure to pesticides with asthma, cancer,
developmental and learning disabilities, nerve and immune system
damage, liver or kidney damage, reproductive impairment, birth
defects and disruption of the endocrine system.
C. Infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with
compromised immune systems and chemical sensitivities are especially
vulnerable to pesticide effects and exposure.
D. Lawn pesticides are harmful to pets, wildlife, soil microbiology, plants,
and natural ecosystems and can run off into streams, lakes and drinking
water sources.
E. Integrated Pest Management is the coordinated use of pest and
environmental information and all available pest control methods
(sanitation, mechanical, biological and "least toxic" chemical) to
prevent unacceptable levels of pest damage by the most economical
means with the least possible hazard to people, property and the
environment.
F. Integrated Pest Management has been investigated and considered by
the Environmental Commission and it is recommended by the
Environmental Commission as a desirable and appropriate policy in
order to reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides.
G. The Township of Irvington does maintain public properties at which
pest management issues are an ongoing concern.
H. The Mayor and Council have determined that it is in the best interest of
the health, welfare, comfort and safety of the Township's citizens to
adopt Integrated Pest Management at the Township's pest management
policy.

to make every effort to participate in this endeavor on their own property,
and the Township will designate certain public properties, such as
community parks, as "Pesticide-Free Zones."
§ 449-18. Posting of pesticide-free zones.

General Provisions
§ 460-1. Findings; declaration of policy.
It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Town structures used
for nonresidential as well as residential use which are or may become in the
future substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance,
and, further, that such conditions, including but not limited to structural
deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of exterior of premises,
infestation, lack of essential heating, plumbing, storage or refrigeration
equipment, lack of maintenance or upkeep of essential utilities and
facilities, existence of fire hazards, insanitary conditions, constitute a
menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of
the citizens and inhabitants of the Town. It is further found and declared
that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain
properties have the further effect of creating blighting conditions and
initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the
aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time
the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same, and that by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as
herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and
the neighborhood property values thereby maintained, the desirability and
amenities of residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhoods
enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.
§ 460-2. Purposes; construal of provisions.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, morals
and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance, condition and occupancy of nonresidential
premises; to establish minimum standards governing utilities and facilities
and other physical components and conditions essential to make the
aforesaid facilities fit for occupancy and use; to fix certain responsibilities
and duties upon owners and operators, and distinct and separate
responsibilities and duties upon occupants; to authorize and establish
procedures for the inspection of nonresidential premises; to fix penalties
for the violations of this chapter; to provide for the right of access across
adjoining premises; to permit repairs; and to provide for the repair,
demolition or vacation of premises unfit for occupancy or use. This chapter
is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public interest
and it is intended that this chapter be literally construed to effectuate the
purposes as stated herein.

§ 460-70. Securing of vacant property and vacant lots. [Amended
6-26-2018 by Ord. No. MC 3656]
A. Any person, company, corporation or beneficiary, whose property
becomes vacant or shows evidence of vacancy is herein to be
considered abandoned and shall within 10 days of receiving notice of
the declaration of vacancy register said property with the Director of
Housing Services or his or her designee.
B. The registration shall contain the name of any owner, including any
beneficiary, the direct street address of the owner (no P.O. boxes), a
direct contact name and number and in the case of a corporation or
LLC, provide a copy of the certificate of formation and a copy of valid
driver's license or identification for the owner or principal with physical
address, the name, address and number for the local property manager,
the person responsible for security, maintenance and marketing of the
property, if applicable.
C. An annual registration fee of $500 shall accompany the registration
form submitted. The fee will be required by August 31 of each year, and
must be received no later than September 10 of the year due. Any
property that has been validly registered for at least three years shall
pay a fee of $750. If the same property remains on the list for five years,
then the fee will be increased to $1,000 and, after 10 years, the fee will
be increased to $2,000. Any bank that registers a vacant property or
vacant lot shall designate a registered agent listed in the State of New
Jersey. In the event that a bank fails to comply with this section, a fine of
$2,500 per day shall be imposed.
A. It is the responsibility of the owner to secure the property registered
under this article. "Secure" means, but is not limited to, the closure and
locking of windows, doors (including garage) and any other opening. In
the case of windows, such shall be secured by means of reglazing or
boarding of same. The owner should also be responsible for notifying
the Township by written notice to the public officer of any change in
ownership. For vacant lots see Subsections C and D below.
B. If the property is owned by a corporation or out-of-area owner, a local
property management company shall be contracted to perform weekly
inspections to verify compliance with this article. "Out of the area" shall
mean any owner located at least 50 miles away from subject property.
§ 460-69 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 460-70
1:595
§ 460-71. Enforcement authority.
The property, if vacant, shall be posted with a name and twenty-fourhour
contact number of the local property management company or
a twenty-four-hour number for the owner. The posting shall be no
less than 18 inches by 24 inches with words in a prominent font and

Concerns Call. . . ." shall appear on the posted sign. The posting shall

partially built structure (Construction was initiated on the property and
was discontinued prior to completion, leaving the building unsuitable
for occupancy, and no construction has taken place in accordance with
the permits issued.), a partial structure or a partially demolished
structure leaving the partial structure unsuitable for occupancy. The
Township's concerns regarding vacant lots are consistent with the
findings and declarations relative to abandoned properties set forth in
N.J.S.A. 55:19-79. Vacant lots are a concern because they tend to attract
or be subjected to illegal dumping and other nefarious activities.

nuisance by the public officer in the Township as defined by Municipal
Code § 460-70C shall be completely fenced along the front yard (and

spaced a maximum of eight feet, zero inches, apart. The posts shall be
installed at a minimum of 24 inches into the ground and secured with
concrete. The fence shall have a six-foot-to-eight-foot-wide gate/door to
access the lot for maintenance. The fence must remain structurally
sound and in good repair at all times. Property owners or their designee
must apply for a permit from the Department of Housing, Division of
Buildings, prior to installing a fence.
E. All vacant lot owners will have until Friday, August 17, 2018, to be in
compliance with this revised Municipal Code. Extensions may be
granted based on extraordinary situations upon review of a written
request submitted by the property owner to the Department of
Housing.
A. Inspectors under the authority of the Director shall have the authority
to issue a summons for any violations found under this article. The
Township Public Safety Department is also authorized herein to issue
appropriate summonses. [Amended 10-14-2015 by Ord. No. MC
3553]

§ 472-1. Establishment of rents.
From and after the effective date of this chapter, no landlord in the
Township of Irvington shall charge any rent in excess of that which he
was charging as of the effective date hereof, except for such increases
as are provided herein. Establishment of rents charged on dwelling units
to which this chapter is applicable shall hereafter be determined by this
chapter. At the expiration of a lease or at the termination of the lease of a
periodic tenant, no landlord may request, charge or receive an increase in
rent greater than that allowed by Subsection A of this section. A periodic
tenant whose lease term is less than one year shall not be caused to pay
any increase in any twelve-month period which exceeds that allowed by
Subsection A of this section. No tenant shall be caused to pay more than
one increase in any twelve-month period.
A. The increase in rents permitted under this section shall be as follows:
(1) Where the landlord supplies heat to the dwelling unit, the increase
in rent shall not exceed 4% of the prior year's rent.
(2) Where the landlord does not supply heat to the dwelling unit, the
increase in rent shall not exceed 3% of the prior year's rent.
(3) An individual age 65 or older who is a sole tenant or living with
other adults all aged 65 or older within the unit shall be limited to a
2% increase annually regardless of whether the landlord provides
heat to the unit.
(4) Where a vacancy of a dwelling unit presently exists or occurs after
the effective date of this chapter, the provisions of Subsection A(1)
and (2) and (3) hereinabove shall not apply, and the rent for said
vacant dwelling unit shall be decontrolled until said dwelling unit is
again rented or leased at a new agreed rental rate. After one year
of said new rental, the increase in rent permitted for said new
tenancy shall be as set forth in Subsection A(1) and (2) and (3)
above.
B. The increase permitted under Subsection A herein shall be computed
upon the base rent charged the tenant and not upon the base rent plus
any hardship or capital surcharge granted under § 472-4 of this chapter
and collected for any specified period of time.
§ 467-1 IRVINGTON CODE § 472-1
1:610
§ 472-2. Notification of rental increase.
Any landlord who shall increase rents as provided in § 472-1 hereof shall
give notice to his tenants by any reasonable means of said increase;
provided, however, that when said notice is not mailed to the tenant's
residence, delivery is not considered to have been accomplished unless a
C. A landlord shall not be entitled to request, charge or receive any tax
surcharge by reason of increase in municipal property taxes.
D. Tenants of any residential properties may present a written petition
signed by a majority of the tenants and consented to by the landlord of
the property agreeing to a specific rent surcharge for a specific purpose
or project, and providing for the landlord's permission to permit the
tenant's representative to review the expenditures involved for the
particular purpose or project surcharge. Each dwelling unit shall be
considered a single tenant for the purposes of this subsection. If the
aforementioned surcharge is approved by the Rent Leveling Officer, the
surcharges shall run for maximum of two years, if so provided. If there
are in existence joint agreements which have been in existence for
more than two years, they shall expire within 60 days after the effective
passage of this amendment.
E. Unbundling.
(1) A landlord shall not be allowed to unbundle service in order to
defeat the intent of this chapter.
(a) "Unbundling" shall include, but not be limited to,
subcontracting or providing for a separate charge for parking.
Unbundling shall also include changing the term(s) of any
previously received security deposit by increasing the amount
to be deposited with the landlord beyond the amount agreed to
in the original lease or in the event of valid rent increases
requiring a tenant to deposit more than the proportional
increase of deposit which would make the security deposit
consistent with the terms of the original lease.
(b) Any person or persons residing as a tenant on the effective
date of said unbundling shall be entitled to remain in their
then-existing status as long as they shall remain as a tenant.
(2) Fines may be levied on a daily basis for anyone found to be in
violation of this section. Each day the violation continues to exist
can be treated as a separate violation subject to a daily fine. Fines
shall be issued by the Rent Leveling Officer and/or designee.
F. Fees for late payment of rent and bounced checks. Prospectively, upon
renewal of a lease or upon entering a new lease, the landlord shall
include a provision in the lease agreement limiting fees for payment of
rent by the tenant more than seven days late to a maximum of $50 and
limiting fees for bounced checks to a maximum of $25.

is notified by mail other than certified or registered mail, the landlord or
his representative shall certify in writing that he mailed the notice to the
tenant. Said certification shall be retained for a period of three years.

the Township.
A. If, as the result of circumstances which he could not reasonably have
foreseen or anticipated or which are beyond his/her control, a landlord
is unable to earn a fair rate of return on his investment, he may appeal
to the Rent Leveling Officer (hereafter "RLO") for an increase in rent in
excess of that permitted under § 472-1 hereof, via an application to be
developed by the RLO. In connection with any appeal filed hereunder,
the landlord shall prove his expenses of operation, including but not
limited to payment of the purchase money mortgage or mortgages and
any subsequent mortgages, the proceeds of which were used for major
capital improvements as defined in Subsection B of this section, fuel,
utilities, taxes, sewer user charges, maintenance and repairs, a
management fee not to exceed 5% of gross rents, and related charges.
Management fees may be allowed as an expense, whether paid to the
landlord or a management company. For good cause shown, the RLO
may grant either an increase in the rent charged or permit the landlord
to receive a surcharge to be collected for a specified period of time only
in order to enable the landlord to earn said fair rate of return.
B. Major capital improvement surcharge.
(1) A major capital improvement consists of a substantial change in the
housing accommodations such as would materially increase the
rental value in a normal market and will provide tenants with a
benefit or service which they had not previously enjoyed.
Replacement of facilities, materials or equipment so as to maintain

§ 472-5. Compliance.
No application made pursuant to § 472-4A of this chapter may be heard by
the Board unless attached thereto is an informational certificate or report
of inspection issued by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs
the same level of services as previously provided or bargained for
shall not constitute a major capital improvement.
(2) Major capital improvement adjustment.
(a) A landlord may seek a rent surcharge for a major capital
improvement. Any landlord seeking a major capital
improvement surcharge shall apply to the Rent Leveling
Officer and pay the application fee of $75, via the aboveproposed
application, which the RLO shall, upon a showing of
satisfactory proof, determine if said improvement is a major
capital improvement and, if so, shall permit such surcharge. In
no event shall any surcharge permitted under this section
exceed the annual cost of the capital improvement per room
multiplied by the number of rooms occupied by the tenant, or
exceed 15% of the tenant's base rent, whichever is the lesser.
The surcharge may be granted for the entire premises or the
particular units benefited by the improvement.
(b) Any major capital improvement surcharge granted by the RLO
shall be paid in equal monthly installments over the period set
by the RLO.
C. No application filed pursuant to Subsection A or B of this section may
be heard by the RLO unless the landlord shall have attached to his
application proof under oath that he has given notice of same to all
affected tenants by posting a copy thereof in the front lobby or
entranceway to the premises and by mailing same at least two weeks
prior to the first scheduled hearing of the matter by the RLO. Said
notice, a copy of which shall be attached to said application, shall
clearly set forth the content and basis of the application. Notice of
application for relief pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall
include the total cost of the completed capital improvement, the
number of years of useful life of the improvement as claimed by the
landlord for purposes of depreciation for income tax purposes, the
actual cost of the improvement, the total number of square feet of the
dwelling or unit affected, the total square feet occupied by the tenant, if
applicable, and the capital improvement surcharge he is seeking from
each tenant.
D. No hardship or capital improvement increase or surcharge may be
granted unless the landlord shall have held title to the premises in
question for a period of at least one year prior to the date of his
application for said relief, unless, for good cause shown, the RLO
waives this requirement.

or the Department of Housing Services pursuant to § 355-26 of this Code
not more than 18 months prior to the date of said application. No such
application may be approved by the Board unless the Board shall have first
determined that there are no substantial violations of the health, safety or
housing laws, codes or regulations of the Township of Irvington affecting
said premises. In the event that said informational certificate or report of
inspection discloses substantial violations of said laws, codes or regulations,
the Board may approve such application; conditioned, however, upon the
submission by the landlord within 180 days of said conditional approval
of an informational certificate or report of inspection indicating that all of
said violations have been corrected. Failure to submit said supplemental
certificate or report within 180 days shall render any conditional approval
void as of the date granted, and any hardship rent increase or surcharge
collected during said period of time shall be returned forthwith to the
tenant.
§ 472-6. Rent Leveling Officer.
In order to administer the provisions of this chapter, the prior authority
exercised under the auspices of the Rent Leveling Board within the
Township of Irvington shall be exercised by the Rent Leveling Officer.
§ 472-7. Acts to cause tenant to vacate prohibited.
No landlord of dwelling units to which this chapter is applicable shall do, or
cause to be done, any act or thing with the intent to cause a tenant to vacate
said dwelling unit in order that said dwelling unit shall become vacant
and no longer subject to this chapter as provided by § 151-3E252 hereof. In
any proceeding instituted by a tenant under this section, the reduction of
standards of service, maintenance, health and safety conditions, furniture,
furnishings or equipment in and for said dwelling unit shall create a
rebuttable presumption that the act or thing done or caused to be done by
the landlord was done with the intent to cause said tenant to vacate said
dwelling unit.
§ 472-8. Powers of Rent Leveling Officer; landlord property/unit
registration.
The Rent Leveling Officer shall have the following powers:
A. To promulgate such rules and regulations as he/she deems necessary to
implement the purposes of this act, which rules and regulations shall be

measurement and sampling facilities shall be installed by the
industrial user at its own expense.

rate of charges based upon the results of an industrial cost
recovery/heavy metals survey and shall embody the estimated first

industry may, at its option and at its own cost and expense, separate its
industrial waste from its domestic waste and provide separate
connections to the municipal sewer system for each such type of waste.
If an industry exercises this option of separation of wastes as herein set

recovery charges, reduced by the ratio of the capacity used, multiplied by
the ratio of its period of use remaining, to the total cost recovery period of
30 years.
§ 499-17. Effect of discontinuance of use.
Discontinuance by an industry of its use of the treatment works shall relieve
said industry of further industrial cost recovery charges, unless use thereof
is thereafter resumed. The remaining industries shall not be required to

Discharge of Groundwater to Sanitary Sewer
[Adopted 1-24-1995 by Ord. No. MC 3011 (Ch. 161, Art. III, of the
1981 Revised Code)]
§ 499-30. Use of public sewers.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater,
surface water, groundwater (except as set forth below), roof runoff,
subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted
industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
B. Direct or indirect discharges of groundwater to the Joint Meeting
Wastewater Treatment Facilities shall only be permitted under the
following circumstances:
(1) The proposed discharger or applicant has filed an application for
and has been issued a nondomestic wastewater discharge permit
("permit") by the Joint Meeting.
(2) For long-term, continuous discharges, the Township of Irvington
(hereinafter referred to as "municipality"), at the election of the
municipality, the proposed discharger or applicant (hereinafter
"applicant") will be required to identify and eliminate two gallons of
infiltration/inflow to the Joint Meeting Wastewater Treatment
Facilities for each gallon of groundwater to be delivered into the
Joint Meeting Wastewater Treatment Facilities on a daily average
over the life of the remediation project discharge (two-to-one
offset).
(a) The location(s) of the remedial work to be performed by the
applicant shall be identified by the use of the Phase III Sewer
System Evaluation Report, prepared by Hazen and Sawyer,
dated August 1983, and as supplemented, which was
previously distributed by the Joint Meeting to each member
municipality in the Joint Meeting service area, or such other
report as may be available in the case of nonmember
municipalities.
(b) The remedial work to be performed by the applicant shall be
completed within a time period that shall not exceed 1/2 of the
time frame of the remediation project discharge estimated by
the proposed discharger or applicant and approved by the
municipality and the Joint Meeting. In the event that
extraordinary, unforeseen circumstances occur that will affect
the ability of the applicant to meet the time period previously
agreed upon by the parties for completion of the infiltration/
inflow remedial work, the applicant may seek an extension of
the time period through the filing of a written request not less
than 60 days before a previously defined and agreed-upon
milestone, fully describing the extraordinary, unforeseen
§ 499-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 499-30
1:649
circumstances and specifying the additional time necessary to
complete the remedial work as a result thereof. Such requests
for extensions will be considered by the Joint Meeting on a
case-by-case basis, and an extension of time shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
(c) An applicant may not discharge groundwater to the Joint
Meeting Wastewater Treatment Facilities until it has obtained
a permit and an agreement is reached between the Joint
Meeting and the municipality and/or the applicant upon the
terms of the remediation work to be performed to satisfy the
two-to-one-offset policy set forth in this regulation.
(d) At intervals to be mutually agreed upon by the applicant and
the Joint Meeting, the applicant shall be required to
demonstrate, in written progress reports, to the satisfaction of
the Joint Meeting, that the applicant is making definable
progress in performing the remedial work so as to be able to
complete the work within the time frame established in
accordance with Subsection B(2)(b) above.
(e) After the time that the location(s) of the remedial work is
identified by the municipality and agreed to by the Joint
Meeting, but prior to the initiation of the remedial work, the
applicant will be required to submit proof to the Joint Meeting
that a performance bond in the amount of 100% of the value of
the remedial work and naming the Joint Meeting as a coobligee
has been issued to ensure that such work is completely
performed.
(3) Short-term, batch discharges.
(a) For short-term, batch discharges, the applicant will be
required to identify and eliminate two gallons of infiltration/
inflow into the Joint Meeting Wastewater Treatment Facilities
for each gallon of groundwater to be delivered to the Joint
Meeting Treatment Works on a daily average over the life of
the remediation project discharge (two-to-one offset).
(b) The material to be discharged from the site of the remediation
project may be delivered in tanker vehicles to the Joint
Meeting Wastewater Treatment Facilities in Elizabeth, New
Jersey, for direct discharge at a rate of $0.03 per gallon (for
example, $150 per five-thousand-gallon trailer), to compensate
Joint Meeting for the costs to sample, monitor and process the
discharge. The use of this option will be at the reasonable
discretion of the Joint Meeting in order to avoid the arrival of a
number of trailers that will adversely impact the performance
of treatment operations by the Joint Meeting.
§ 499-30 IRVINGTON CODE § 499-30
1:650
(4) In the event that the two-to-one-offset option is selected with
respect to short-term, batch discharges, then the following
procedures shall apply:
(a) The location(s) of the remedial work to be performed by the
applicant shall be identified by the municipality and agreed to
by the Joint Meeting through the use of the Phase III Sewer
System Evaluation Report, prepared by Hazen and Sawyer,
dated August 1983, and as supplemented, which was
previously distributed by the Joint Meeting to each member
municipality in the Joint Meeting service area, or such other
report as may be available in the case of nonmember
municipalities.
(b) The remedial work to be performed by the applicant shall be
completed within a time period that shall not exceed 1/2 of the
time frame of the remediation project discharge estimated by
the proposed discharger or applicant and approved by the
municipality and the Joint Meeting. In the event that
extraordinary, unforeseen circumstances occur that will affect
the ability of the applicant to meet the time period previously
agreed upon by the parties for completion of the infiltration/
inflow remedial work, the applicant may seek an extension of
the time period through the filing of a written request not less
than 60 days before a previously defined and agreed-upon
milestone, fully describing the extraordinary, unforeseen
circumstances and specifying the additional time necessary to
complete the remedial work as a result thereof. Such requests
for extensions will be considered by the Joint Meeting on a
case-by-case basis, and an extension of time shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
(c) An applicant may not discharge groundwater to the Joint
Meeting Wastewater Treatment Facilities until it has obtained
a permit and an agreement is reached between the Joint
Meeting and the municipality and/or the applicant upon the
terms of the remediation work to be performed to satisfy the
two-to-one-offset policy set forth in this regulation should this
option be selected with respect to a short-term, batch
discharge.
(d) At intervals to be mutually agreed upon by the applicant and
the Joint Meeting, the applicant shall be required to
demonstrate, in written progress reports, to the satisfaction of
the Joint Meeting, that the applicant is making definable
progress in performing the remedial work so as to be able to
complete the work within the time frame established in
accordance with Subsection B(4)(b) above.
(e) After the time that the location(s) of the remedial work is
identified by the municipality and agreed to by the Joint
§ 499-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 499-30
1:651
Meeting, but prior to the initiation of the remedial work, the
applicant will be required to submit proof to the Joint Meeting
that a performance bond in the amount of 100% of the value
of the remedial work and naming the Joint Meeting as a coobligee
has been issued to ensure that such work is completely
performed.
(5) The groundwater to be discharged to the Joint Meeting Wastewater
Treatment Facilities pursuant to a permit will be, at all times,
subject to analyses by the Joint Meeting, at the sole cost of the
applicant, to ensure that the proposed discharge shall meet the
quality limits as set forth in these sewer use rules and regulations.
At any time during the period of the discharge of groundwater to
the Joint Meeting, a failure by the applicant to meet such quality
limits shall be the basis for a revocation of the permit and a
discontinuation of the discharge, and/or such enforcement
measures as are authorized by law to be taken by the Joint
Meeting.263
(6) The proposed discharger or applicant shall be obligated to institute
pretreatment measures prior to the direct or indirect discharge of
groundwater to the Joint Meeting in the event that the
groundwater fails to meet the parameters for acceptance of the
discharge set forth in the Sewer Use Rules and Regulations.264
(7) Credits for future discharges of groundwater through the removal
of infiltration/inflow pursuant to the above provisions may be
accumulated or "banked"; however, such credits may only be
transferred in accordance with ownership of the site identified as
the source of groundwater at the time of the performance of the
remediation work.

of recyclable materials, in accordance with guidelines for regulations
established by the Director of Public Works and the certified recycling
professional. Violation and penalty notices will be directed to the owner or
management, in those instances where the violator is not easily identifiable.

dumpster designated for recycling material only. If the property owners
of said multi-unit dwellings are unable to meet the requirements for the
removal of solid waste and recycling according to the established
municipal curbside collection program, a private contracting service
must be established by the property owner for solid waste and recycling
services, at the owner's expense. At the end of the year, all recycling
tonnage reports must be submitted to the Director of Public Works or
certified recycling professional for state documentation purposes
according to the state and county regulations.270

As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated:

municipal ordinance or incorporated pursuant to N.J.S.A. 15A:1-1 et seq.
and designated by municipal ordinance to receive funds collected by a
special assessment within a special improvement district as authorized by
this article.
A. The Irvington Municipal Council finds as follows:
(1) That an area within the Township of Irvington, as shall be described
hereafter by lot and block numbers as well as by street addresses,
would benefit from being designated as a special improvement
district;
(2) That a District Management Corporation would assist this
Township in promoting economic growth and employment within
the business district by providing administrative and other services
to benefit the businesses, employees, residents and consumers in
the special improvement district;
(3) That a special assessment shall be imposed and collected by the
Township of Irvington with the regular property tax payment in lieu
of taxes and that such special assessment shall be transferred to
the District Management Corporation to exercise the powers given
it by this article and to effectuate the purposes of N.J.S.A. 40:56 et
seq.;
(4) That it is in the best interest of the Township of Irvington and the
public to create such special improvement district and to designate
such District Management Corporation, except that no District
Management Corporation shall be designated to receive any funds
or to exercise any powers, unless the Board of Directors of that
Corporation shall include at least one member of the Municipal
Council of the Township of Irvington.
B. The public policy of the State of New Jersey permits the governing body
to protect the public welfare and health and the interest of the public in
the safe and effective movement of persons and to preserve and
enhance the function and appearance of the business districts of the
Township of Irvington by adoption of a special improvement ordinance.

ARTICLE I
Standards and Management
[Adopted 2-14-2007 by Ord. No. MC 3335 (Ch. 172, Art. I, of the
1981 Revised Code)]
§ 550-1. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in § 550-2.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Township of Irvington.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare, this article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law, except

stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad, or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and

1:708
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth in this subsection into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
§ 550-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-4
1:709
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid
and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of
this subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,
debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
For exemptions to this standard see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Grates.
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle-safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the
smallest dimension.
[2] Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
§ 550-4 IRVINGTON CODE § 550-4
1:710
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 550-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org or is available in the Office of the
Township Engineer.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
§ 550-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-4
1:711
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 550-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
§ 550-4 IRVINGTON CODE § 550-4
1:712
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 550-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 85%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
§ 550-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-4
1:713
site on which the proposed development or project is to
be constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of "major development" at § 550-2 shall be submitted to
the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval
in accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 550-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources
of technical guidance are listed in § 550-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where:
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
§ 550-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-4
1:715
A = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment
device
See § 550-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 550-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
§ 550-4 IRVINGTON CODE § 550-4
1:716
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
§ 550-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-4
1:717
§ 550-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
§ 550-4 IRVINGTON CODE § 550-5
1:718
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and
Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
§ 550-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-5
1:719
§ 550-6. Standards for structural stormwater management

take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 550-8B.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 550-8.

in accordance with due process of law. Complaints of violation of the
conditions of this article shall be reviewed by the Director of Public Safety

Irvington Municipal Council will certify the final list.

his designate, along with an application fee of $192. [Amended

exits, to channel internal traffic flow, to prevent indiscriminate
§ 650-34 IRVINGTON CODE § 650-35
1:1158
diagonal movement of vehicles, and to provide cooling shade and
visual relief from the visual monotony and summer heat of a large
paved parking lot. Curbs of such islands shall be designed so as to
facilitate surface drainage and prevent vehicles from overhanging
sidewalks and damaging landscaping materials.
D. The selection, amount, and location of all landscaping materials shall be
subject to approval by the Planning Board, based upon considerations

(2) In order to provide maximum efficiency, minimum curb cuts, and
encourage safe and convenient traffic circulation, an applicant may
request, as part of the site plan application, an interconnection of
parking lots via access drives within and between adjacent lots,
provided that the applicant has obtained the written consent of the
owners of those adjacent lots. The Planning Board may require
deed restrictions to be adopted in order to bind the owner of the
properties to maintain the interconnection permanently.
(3) Off-street parking areas shall be designed to prevent the
maneuvering of vehicles into or out of parking spaces or the
parking or storage of vehicles within any portion of an entrance
driveway or driveways that is within 10 feet of the right-of-way line
of any road.
(4) No required off-street parking space, including adjacent parking
access lanes or maneuvering space, shall be located within an
existing or proposed right-of-way of any road, nor within 10 feet of
any existing or proposed right-of-way line or any public street or
highway. Fire lanes shall be provided to give access to buildings for
firefighting, as required.
(5) Parking spaces shall be usable without requiring excessive
maneuvering when all other spaces are occupied by vehicles. The
Planning Board shall make a determination of whether a parking
§ 650-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-35
1:1159
space is usable. Parking spaces that are not usable shall not count
toward satisfying any parking requirement and shall not be
approved.
(6) In order to provide visibility and definition at the ends of parking
aisles, a planted area enclosed by concrete curbing shall be
provided. Such planted islands may be used to partially satisfy the
landscaping requirements of this section.
(7) Dead-end parking aisles shall not be permitted except where
unavoidable, as determined by the Planning Board.
(8) Concrete wheel stops or raised curbing shall be provided as
required by the Planning Board and shall be so located as to
prevent the overhang of any vehicle into any pedestrian sidewalk or
landscaped area or required buffer strip.
(9) Each parking space shall not be less than nine feet wide and 18 feet
long, except that where a parking space is bounded by a curb or the
wall of a building, each space shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide.
Parallel parking spaces shall be minimum of 10 feet wide and 22
feet long. Handicapped parking spaces shall be designed in
accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.416
(10) The side perimeter of each parking space shall be delineated by
painted lines on the pavement.
(11) The facilities provided in any parking lot and their arrangement
shall not be changed without due consideration and approval by the
Planning Board. Furthermore, any modification of fire lanes in a
parking lot shall be reviewed and approved by the Township.
H. Appropriate signs shall be provided in parking lots to direct internal
traffic flow. Such signs shall generally not exceed one square foot in
area.
I. Lighting.
(1) Mounting heights shall not exceed 20 feet above grade. Lower
heights shall be used for walkways.

other property and public streets off the site, to the greatest extent
possible. Lamps shall be recessed in the luminaire.
(3) All wires and cables shall be underground.
(4) At least 50% of all lighting shall be turned off after business hours,
when only lights necessary for security purposes shall be left on.

ARTICLE XV
Wireless Telecommunications Towers and Antennas
§ 650-95. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of
wireless communications towers and antennas. In furtherance of the goals
listed below, the Township of Irvington shall give due consideration to the
adopted Township Master Plan, Zoning Map,423 and existing land uses, in
considering sites for the location of towers and antennas. The goals of this
article are to:
§ 650-96. Applicability.
All new telecommunications towers or antennas in the Township of
Irvington shall be subject to these regulations, with the exception of the
following:
A. Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas;
B. Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas;
C. Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
D. Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a
primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
E. Encourage users of towers and antenna to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is
minimal;
F. Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas
through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
G. Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently;
H. Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and
I. Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
A. Amateur radio station operators/receive-only antennas. This section
shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is
under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally
licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for
receive-only antennas.
423. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 650-95 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-96
1:1203
§ 650-97. General requirements.
B. Residential satellite dish antennas. This section shall not govern any
satellite dish antennas used for residential purposes.
C. AM array. For the purposes of implementing this section, an AM array,
consisting of one or more tower units and supporting ground system
which functions as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered
one tower. Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall
be measured from the outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM
array. Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of the
AM array by right.
A. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory
uses. The presence of an existing use or structure on a lot shall not
preclude the installation of a telecommunications tower or antenna on
such lot. If a tower and its appurtenant structures constitute the sole
use of the lot, the tower shall be deemed to be the principal use.
B. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or
antenna complies with zone development regulations, including but not
limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other
such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even
though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within
such lot.
C. Each applicant for a telecommunications tower or antenna shall provide
the Township with an inventory of its existing telecommunications
towers, antennas, or sites approved for telecommunications towers or
antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the Township of
Irvington or within three miles of the borders thereof, including specific
information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The
Township may share such information with other applicants applying
for administrative approvals or permits under this section or other
organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the
Township of Irvington, provided, however that the Township is not, by
sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that
such sites are available or suitable.
D. Telecommunications towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
(1) Telecommunications towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel
finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted
a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural
setting and surrounding buildings.
§ 650-96 IRVINGTON CODE § 650-97
1:1204
§ 650-98. Permitted uses.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a
telecommunications tower, the antenna and supporting electrical
and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is
identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting
structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
E. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or
other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
F. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of
the FAA, the FCC, and any other agencies of the state or federal
government with the authority to regulate telecommunications towers
and antennas.
G. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications towers, the
owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with
standards contained in applicable state or local building codes424 and
the applicable standards for telecommunications towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association.
H. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and permitted pursuant to this
section and shall not be regulated or permitted as essential services,
public utilities, or private utilities.
I. Owners and/or operators of telecommunications towers or antennas
shall certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/
or operation of a wireless communication system in the Township of
Irvington have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required
franchises with the Township of Irvington.
J. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.
K. To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation
and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one
carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction
of new towers.
A. Telecommunications towers or antennas shall be permitted on property
owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the Township of Irvington,
provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been
approved by the Township of Irvington. The Township may, as a
condition of such lease, require site plan approval.

collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type
as the existing tower.
(2) An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height,
provided the new tower meets all the requirements that would
normally be required for the construction of a new tower pursuant
to this article.
C. All new permitted telecommunication towers shall be required to
comply with the following standards:
(1) No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of
towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna.
(a) The Planning Board shall consider the following factors in
determining whether to issue a conditional use permit:
[1] Height of the proposed tower;
[2] Proximity of the tower to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
[3] Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
[4] Surrounding topography;
[5] Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
[6] Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
§ 650-99 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-99
1:1207

antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
[5] The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures
unsuitable.
[6] The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology
that does not require the use of towers or structures is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed
new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed
to render the technology unsuitable.
(2) The tower base and any accessory structures and buildings
attached thereto must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback
requirements. In addition, the following setback requirements shall

an existing street in conjunction with road construction being performed
by the Township, the company shall change the location of its aboveground
facilities covered by this ordinance in accordance with applicable law, so

1:1226
§ A675-25. Joint use of structures.
Any company or corporation having legal authority to place its facilities in
the public streets and ways of the Township may jointly use the company's

ordinance.
§ A675-26. Use of space by Township.
The company shall provide space, to the extent available, on its poles

this ordinance, but not exceeding one duct of standard size, for the sole
benefit of the Township during the pendency of this ordinance. Such space
shall be provided for the exclusive use of the Township which use shall
be limited to accommodating the wires or electrical conductors required

circuits for the supply of electrical energy for traffic or other signals; nor
for wires, conductors, cable or the equivalent which provide a means of
transmitting any signal to a private, commercial or residential location,
and which is normally provided by a nongovernmental supplier; provided,
further, that no such use or attachment by the Township shall interfere
with the plant or facilities of or the use thereof by the company. All costs
or expenses incurred by the company in connection therewith shall be
paid by the Township. It shall be the obligation of the Township to attach
its wires to the poles or place its electric conductors in the conduits or
manholes of the company, provided that, before proceeding with said work,
either by itself or by a person, firm or corporation engaged to perform
such work, the Township shall give the company 30 days' prior notice in
writing. All such work shall be performed under the supervision of said
company. The Township will indemnify and save harmless the company
from and against all claims, liabilities or demands arising in any manner
in connection with the Township's wires or facilities or their installation,
maintenance, operation or removal, or the Township's use or enjoyment of
the company's plant or facilities provided under this § A675-26.
§ A675-27. Control over streets by county or state.
If any or all of the said streets or ways are later taken over by the County of
Essex or the State of New Jersey, such county or state shall have such rights
and privileges and be subject to the same terms, conditions and limitations
of use as apply herein to the Township; provided, however, that satisfactory
prior arrangements as may be necessary are made with the Township and
the company for the full protection of the respective interest of each.
§ A675-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A675-28
1:1227
§ A675-28. Future changes in Township.
The term "Township" as used in this ordinance shall be held to apply to and
include any form of municipality or government into which the Township or
any part thereof may at any time hereafter be changed, annexed, or merged.
§ A675-29. Effect on future equipment; supersession of prior
consent ordinances.
The permission and consent hereby granted shall apply to and cover all

structures, process equipment, and appurtenances heretofore or hereafter
erected, constructed, reconstructed, removed, located, relocated, replaced,
maintained, repaired, or operated by the company, its predecessors,

company regarding the subject matter hereof.
§ A675-30. Responsibilities of companies.
The company shall maintain its property within the Township and shall
comply with applicable law for the provision of safe, adequate and proper
service at just and reasonable rates, and safeguard the public interest in

§ A675-31. Severability.
In the event that any provision herein shall for any reason be illegal or
unenforceable under applicable law, such illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provisions of this ordinance, and this ordinance shall
be construed as if such illegal or unenforceable provision(s) had never been
contained herein.
§ A675-32. Publication expenses; when effective.
The company shall pay the expenses incurred for advertising required in
connection with the passage of this ordinance, after the date of its first
reading, within 30 days after the company has received a bill for said
advertising from the publisher. Following final passage of this ordinance,
the Township Clerk shall provide the company with written notice thereof
by certified mail. As provided by applicable law, this ordinance, and any
subsequent amendments, shall not become effective until acceptance
thereof by the company and approval thereof by the Board of Public Utility
Commissioners.

A. TCG New Jersey, a wholly owned affiliate of AT&T, shall pay the
Township of Irvington $1,000 as an initial administrative processing
