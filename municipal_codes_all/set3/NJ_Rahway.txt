Institutions Doing Business With or in the Republic of South Africa
[Adopted 6-13-1984 by Ord. No. A-14-84]
§ 15-1. Statement of policy.
The system of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa which has been
condemned by the United Nations as "a crime against humanity"
systematically denies economic, political and social freedoms to the vast
majority of the populace. Apartheid laws which separate black families,
keep blacks in the lowest paying jobs and deny them the right to vote
exemplifies the institutionalized violation of human rights. Millions of
dollars of public moneys are invested or deposited by state, county and
municipal governments in banks and other financial institutions doing
business in or with the Republic of South Africa. These moneys support
the racist government of South Africa. Therefore, the people of the City of
Rahway declare that public moneys should be removed from banks or other
financial institutions doing business in or with the Republic of South Africa.
§ 15-2. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CITY FUNDS  Any moneys invested or deposited directly by the City of
Rahway.13
§ 15-3. Certification of banks and financial institutions.
Before any City funds can be deposited or invested in any bank or financial
institution, the Comptroller shall require that each bank or financial
institution submit an affidavit certifying that said bank or financial
institution does not, directly or through a subsidiary, have any loans to:
A. The Republic of South Africa;
B. A national corporation of or other corporation organized under the laws
of the Republic of South Africa; and

HOUSING AUTHORITY
§ 47-1. Declaration statement.
The Council hereby determines that:
§ 47-2. Establishment of local Housing Authority; powers and
duties.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Local Housing Authorities Law, N.J.S.A.
55:14A-1 et seq., as amended and supplemented,18 a body corporate and
politic, to be known as the "Housing Authority of the City of Rahway,"
is hereby created and established. The Housing Authority shall have the
functions, powers and duties prescribed by said Local Housing Authorities
Law, as amended and supplemented, or any other applicable state law.
A. There exists in the city insanitary and unsafe dwelling accommodations,
and persons of low income are forced to reside in such insanitary and
unsafe dwelling accommodations, and there exists in the city a shortage
of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which
persons of low income can afford, and such persons are forced to
occupy overcrowded and congested dwellings. The aforesaid conditions
cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a
menace to health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the city
and impair economic value. These conditions necessitate excessive and
disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and
punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection and
other services and facilities.
B. Areas in the city cannot be cleared nor can the shortage of safe and
sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved through the
operation of private enterprise. The construction of housing projects for
persons of low income, as defined in the Local Housing Authorities
Law,17 would, therefore, not be competitive with private enterprise.
C. The clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which
insanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe
and sanitary dwelling accommodations by any public body for persons
of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may
be spent and private property acquired and are governmental
functions. It is in the public interest that work on projects for such
purposes be commenced as soon as practicable.

copy of such map and of this article shall be provided without cost to the
County Clerk and to the office of the Union County Prosecutor.
§ 189-5. Additional determinations.
The following additional matters are hereby determined, declared, recited
and stated:
A. It is understood that the map approved and adopted pursuant to § 189-1
of this article was prepared and is intended to be used as evidence in
§ 189-1 DRUG-FREE ZONES § 189-5
189:281
prosecutions arising under the criminal laws of this state and that,
pursuant to state law, such map shall constitute prima facie evidence of
the following:
(1) The location of elementary and secondary schools within the
municipality.
(2) The boundaries of the real property which is owned by or leased to
such schools or a school board.
(3) That such school property is and continues to be used for school
purposes.
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 1,000
feet of such school property.
B. Except as is otherwise expressly noted on the face of the approved and
adopted map, all of the property depicted on the map approved and
adopted herein as school property was owned by or leased to a school
or school board and was being used for school purposes as of July 9,

approved herein to depict the location and boundaries of any property
which is, in fact, used for school purposes and which is owned by or
leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board, whether
the absence of such depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or
the result of any changes in the location and boundaries of such
property which have not yet been incorporated into a revised approved
map, shall not be deemed to be official finding and record that such
property is not owned by or leased to a school or school board, or that
such property is not used for school purposes.
D. All of the requirements set forth in P.L. 1988, c. 44, concerning the
preparation, approval and adoption of a Drug-Free School Zone Map
have been complied with.

to and within the limitations prescribed by law.
(2) All government records shall be carefully and conveniently filed,

technology, the requester shall pay fees and special fees,

governmental records:

ARTICLE II
Uniform Packaging Requirements
[Adopted 12-9-1996 by Ord. No. O-53-96]
§ 217-6. Findings and purpose.
The Municipal Council finds and declares as follows:
A. Solid waste management within the City of Rahway is a fundamental
concern of the Municipal Council due to the limited landfill space
available, rising costs of waste disposal, and impacts on the
environment.
B. Evidence available to the Municipal Council indicates that discarded
packaging, especially take-out food service packaging, constitutes the
single greatest category of waste within the waste stream of the City of
Rahway, the single greatest source of litter within the City of Rahway,
and is, therefore, a necessary focus of any effort to reduce the amount
of solid waste, as well as reducing the economic and environmental cost
of waste management for the citizens of the City of Rahway.
C. Single use nonrecyclable, nondegradable packaging and plastic
containers are considered to be a fundamental cause of problems
associated with municipal waste disposal and litter.
D. Chemical composition and ability of a substance to degrade are
meaningful and useful criteria to focus upon when establishing a public
policy that is intended to improve the management and disposal of solid
waste, reduce the cumulative impact of litter, encourage composting
and other forms of recycling, minimize the potential for toxic
substances which form if solid waste is burned, reduce the volume of
ash by-products that may be created by the burning of waste plastic
packaging, and otherwise anticipate environmental problems that may
be caused by municipal solid waste disposal programs.
E. The economic and environmental problems associated with
nondegradable substances mixed with degradable substances in the
waste stream are so severe that a program to modify the composition of
the solid waste in the waste stream thereby reducing the environmental
hazards and toxicity associated with solid waste incineration, and
encouraging the composting of putrescible biodegradable wastes and
encouraging other forms of recycling of solid waste substances is
hereby determined to be the policy of the City of Rahway.
F. That certain retail food establishments within the City of Rahway are
the points of origin for a significant volume of packaging waste and,
therefore, are particularly susceptible to actions which have significant
potential for modifying the composition of this portion of the City of
Rahway's solid waste stream thereby improving solid waste
management within this city.
§ 217-6 DRUNK-DRIVING-FREE SCHOOL ZONES § 217-6
193:321
G. The widespread use of plastics, especially polystyrene and polyvinyl
chloride, pose a threat to the environment by posing unnecessary
taking of landfill space, and/or when incinerated, by the possible
introduction of toxic by-products into the atmosphere.
H. The waste stream within the City of Rahway is so large and diverse that
any program to establish policies and laws conductive to any waste
management program in lieu of landfilling must identify and set new
policy for those specific sources of waste packaging which originate in
this city.
I. The use of polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride for food packaging is
problematical because neither of these plastics are readily recyclable;
that their abundant commercial use in lieu of other plastics such as
polyethylene or polypropylene unnecessarily complicates the chemical
composition of the municipal waste and subtracts from the possible
emergence of viable plastic recycling programs; and, if burnt together,
polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride leave a relatively heavier and,
therefore, more expensive ash residue to dispose of, and evidence
indicates that the burning of these products creates dioxin,
hydrochloric acid, and/or other toxic chemicals that could be admitted
into the general environment of the City of Rahway if incinerated.
J. There are readily available plastic and/or paper product substitutes for
most of the polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride retail food packaging
now being used in the City of Rahway, the use of which alternatives
would be environmentally and economically advantageous to the
citizens of the City of Rahway.
K. Nondegradable plastic bags in the waste stream constitute an
impediment to the development of an efficient waste separation,
recycling or other waste management program, and are less desirable
than paper bags because these plastic bags are neither recyclable nor
compostable.
L. The plastic bags used by retail establishments selling food constitutes a
large source of the plastic bags in the waste stream.
M. It is in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of all of the citizens
of the City of Rahway who live, work or do business in the City that the
amount of nonrecyclable, nondegradable packaging be reduced, and
that the amount of litter on the public streets, parks and open spaces be
reduced.
N. Therefore, the purpose of this article is, to the maximum extent
practical, to eliminate the use of nondegradable packaging originating
at retail food establishments in the City of Rahway in order to protect
the air, land, and waters of the City of Rahway from environmental
contamination and degradation.
§ 217-6 RAHWAY CODE § 217-7
193:322
§ 217-7. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DEGRADABLE PACKAGING  Packaging made of cellulose-based
substances or other substances which are capable of being readily attached,
decomposed, assimilated, and/or otherwise completely oxidized or broken
down into its constituent parts by bacteria, natural biological organisms,
carbonaceous soil material, water, carbon dioxide; or in the alternative
capable of otherwise degrading when exposed to ultraviolet light or other
natural processes beginning within a twelve-month period from the date of
manufacture or exposure to the environment.
PACKAGING  All food-related wrappings, including but not limited to
bags, sacks, wrappings, containers, bowls, plates, trays, cartons, cups or
drinking utensils intended for use within the City of Rahway.
RETAIL FOOD VENDOR  All sales outlets, stores, shops, restaurants, or
other places of business located within the City of Rahway, which receives
more than 20% of its revenues through the sales or conveyances of foods
directly to the ultimate consumer, which foods are predominantly contained,
wrapped or held in or on packaging. "Retail food vendors" shall include,
but not be limited to, any establishment where food is prepared, mixed,
cooked, baked, smoked, preserved, bottled, packaged, handled, stored,
manufactured, and sold or offered for sale, including but not limited to
any fixed or mobile restaurant, drive-in, coffee shop, cafeteria, short order

which food or drink is prepared for sale or for service on the premises
or elsewhere and any other establishment or operation, including homes
where food is processed, prepared, stored, served or provided to the public
for charge, provided said vendor shall derive more than 20% of its gross
revenues from the sale of said food or drink.
§ 217-8. Prohibited packaging and utensils.
A. No retail vendor located and doing business in the City of Rahway shall
sell or convey food directly to the ultimate consumer within the City of
Rahway unless such food is placed, wrapped or packaged in degradable
packaging at the conclusion of the sales transaction. For the purposes
of this article, "conclusion of the sales transaction" shall be the point of
time at which the possession of the food product passes from the retail
food vendor to the ultimate consumer, and the conclusion of the sales
transaction need to require the actual payment of consideration for
such food product; provided, however, payment is expected from the
ultimate consumer prior to the consumer exiting the premises of the
retail food vendor.

The title of this chapter is "An Ordinance Banning the Use of Government
Buildings and Equipment for Political Fund-Raising."
§ 229-2. Purpose.
A. Solicitation and acceptance of political contributions on public property
used in the discharge of official duties threatens the independence of
public employees, undermines the efficiency of government by taking
officials and employees away from the people's business, and leads to
the appearance of improper influence of political contributions on
government functions.
B. Prohibiting the solicitation and acceptance of political contributions on
public property used in the discharge of official duties will address
these harms and leave open ample alternative venues for political fundraising.
C. It is accordingly found and determined that the municipality's interests
in an independent and efficient government work force and a
government that is undermined by neither the fact nor appearance of
improper influence of political contributions on government decisions
require the prohibition of political fund-raising on public property used
in the discharge of official duties or through the use of public property.

property, or within a residential unit when the property line between it
and the source property is a common wall, all exterior doors and
windows shall be closed and the measurements shall be taken in the
center of the room most affected by the noise. Residual sound shall be
measured in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:29-2.9(b)2. When measuring
total sound or residual sound, all sound sources within the dwelling unit
must be shut off (e.g., television, stereo). Measurements shall not be
taken in areas which receive only casual use such as hallways, closets
and bathrooms.
C. Indoor measurements shall only be taken if the sound source is on or
within the same property as the receiving property, as in the case of a
multi-use property (e.g., sound generated within a commercial unit of a
multi-use property building and received within a residential unit of the
same building) or multi-dwelling-unit building. In addition, indoor
measurements shall be taken if the property line between the receiving
property and the source property is a common wall, such as in a multidwelling-
unit building. The allowable sound level standards for indoors
are as shown in Tables I and II.

§ 319A-1. Abandoned property criteria.
A. Except as provided in N.J.S.A. 55:19-83, any property that has not been
legally occupied for a period of six months and which meets any one of
the following additional criteria may be deemed to be abandoned
property upon a determination by the City Business Administrator or
§ 319-11 POOL AND BILLIARD ROOMS § 319A-1
315:425
his or her designee (both together throughout this chapter referred to
simply as the "City Business Administrator or his or her designee"),
that:
(1) The property is in need of rehabilitation in the reasonable judgment
of the City Business Administrator or his or her designee and no
rehabilitation has taken place during that same six-month period;
or
(2) Construction was initiated on the property and was discontinued
prior to completion, leaving the building unsuitable for occupancy,
and no construction has taken place for at least six months as of the
date of a determination by the City Business Administrator or his or
her designee pursuant to this section; or
(3) At least one installment of property tax remains unpaid and
delinquent on that property as of the date of a determination by the
City Business Administrator or his or her designee pursuant to this
section; or
(4) The property has been determined to be a nuisance by the City
Business Administrator or his or her designee in accordance with
N.J.S.A. 55:19-82 and may also be subject to the City of Rahway
habitability hearing process, pursuant to Chapter 94 of the City
Code, for one or more of the following reasons:
(a) The property has been found to be unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3;
(b) The condition and vacancy of the property materially increases
the risk of fire to the property and adjacent properties;
(c) The property is subject to unauthorized entry leading to
potential health and safety hazards; the owner has failed to
take reasonable and necessary measures to secure the
property; or the municipality has secured the property in order
to prevent such hazards after the owner has failed to do so;
(d) The presence of vermin or the accumulation of debris, uncut
vegetation or physical deterioration of the structure or
grounds have created potential health and safety hazards and
the owner has failed to take reasonable and necessary
measures to remove the hazards; or
(e) The dilapidated appearance or other condition of the property
materially affects the welfare, including the economic welfare,
of the residents of the area in close proximity to the property,
and the owner has failed to take reasonable and necessary
measures to remedy the conditions.
B. A property which contains both residential and nonresidential space
may be considered abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. so
§ 319A-1 RAHWAY CODE § 319A-1
315:426
§ 319A-2. Establishment of abandoned property list.
long as two-thirds or more of the total net square footage of the building
was previously legally occupied as residential space and none of the
residential space has been legally occupied for at least six months at
the time of the determination of abandonment by the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee.
A. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee shall identify
abandoned property within the City of Rahway for the purpose of
establishing an abandoned property list. The abandoned property list
shall include, for each abandoned property identified, the tax block and
lot number, the name of the owner of record, if known, and the street
address of the lot. The City Business Administrator or his or her
designee may add properties to the abandoned property list at any time,
and may delete properties at any time when he or she finds that the
property no longer meets the definition of an abandoned property.
B. An abandoned property shall not be included on the abandoned
property list if rehabilitation is being performed in a timely manner, as
evidenced by building permits issued and diligent pursuit of
rehabilitation work authorized by those permits. A property on which
an entity other than the City of Rahway has purchased or taken
assignment from the City of a tax sale certificate which has been placed
on the abandoned property list may be removed if the owner of the
certificate pays all municipal taxes and liens due on the property within
30 days after the property is placed on the list; provided, however, that
if the owner of the certificate fails to initiate foreclosure proceedings
within six months after the property was first placed on the list, the
property shall be restored to the abandoned property list in accordance
with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-103.
C. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee shall establish
the abandoned property list and any additions or deletions thereto by
authorizing the publication of the list in the official newspaper of the
City of Rahway, which publication shall constitute public notice, and,
within 10 days after publication, shall send a notice, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, and by regular mail, to the owner of record of
every property included on the list. The published and mailed notices
shall identify property determined to be abandoned setting forth the
owner of record, if known, the tax lot and block number and street
address. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee, in
consultation with the tax collector, shall also send out a notice by
regular mail to any mortgagee, servicing organization, or property tax
processing organization that receives a duplicate copy of the tax bill
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-64(d). When the owner of record is not known
for a particular property and cannot be ascertained by the exercise of
reasonable diligence by the tax collector, notice shall not be mailed but
instead shall be posted on the property in the manner as provided in
N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.7. The mailed notice shall indicate the factual basis for
§ 319A-1 POOL AND BILLIARD ROOMS § 319A-2
315:427
the City Business Administrator or his or her designee's finding that
the property is abandoned property as that term is defined herein
and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54, and shall specify the information relied upon
in making such finding. In all cases a copy of the mailed or posted
notice shall also be filed by the City Business Administrator or his or
her designee in the office of the Somerset County Clerk. This filing
shall have the same force and effect as a formal notice under N.J.S.A.
2A:15-6. The notice shall be captioned with the name of the City of
Rahway as "plaintiff" and the name of the property owner as
"defendant," as though an action had been commenced by the City
against the owner.
D. An owner or lienholder may challenge the inclusion of his property on
the abandoned property list by appealing that determination to the City
Business Administrator or his or her designee within 30 days of the
owner's receipt of the certified notice or 40 days from the date upon
which the notice was sent. An owner whose identity was not known to
the City Business Administrator or his or her designee shall have 40
days from the date upon which notice was published or posted,
whichever is later, to challenge the inclusion of a property on the
abandoned property list. For good cause shown, the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee shall accept a late filing of an
appeal. Within 30 days of receipt of a request for an appeal of the
findings contained in the notice, the City Business Administrator or his
or her designee shall schedule a hearing for redetermination of the
matter. Any property included on the list shall be presumed to be
abandoned property unless the owner, through the submission of an
affidavit or certification asserting that the property is not an abandoned
property, can demonstrate that the property was erroneously included
on the list. The affidavit or certification shall be accompanied by
supporting documentation such as, but not limited to, photographs,
repair invoices, bills and construction contracts. The sole ground for
appeal shall be that the property in question is not abandoned property
as that term is defined herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The City
Business Administrator or his or her designee shall decide any timely
filed appeal within 10 days of the hearing on the appeal and shall
promptly, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular
mail, notify the property owner of the decision and the reasons therefor.
E. The property owner may challenge an adverse determination of an
appeal with the City Business Administrator or his or her designee
pursuant to Subsection D of this section by instituting, in accordance
with the New Jersey Court Rules, a summary trial proceeding in the
Superior Court, Somerset County. Such action shall be instituted within
20 days of the date of the notice of decision mailed by the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee. The sole ground for appeal and
new hearing before the Superior Court shall be that the property in
question is not an abandoned property as that term is defined in N.J.S.A.
55:19-54. The failure to institute an action of appeal on a timely basis
shall constitute a jurisdictional bar to challenging the adverse

§ 319A-3. Additions to abandoned property list.
§ 319A-4. Removal of property from abandoned properties list.
determination, except that, for good cause shown, the Court may
extend the deadline for instituting the action.
F. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee shall promptly
remove any property from the abandoned property list that has been
determined by him or on appeal not to be abandoned and may, in his
discretion, remove properties from said list whenever he deems such
removal appropriate under the circumstances.
G. The abandoned property list shall become effective, and the City of
Rahway shall have the right to pursue any legal remedy with respect to
properties on the list, at any time after at least one property has been
placed on the list and following the expiration of the period for appeal
with respect to that first property or upon the denial of an appeal
brought by the property owner of that first property.
H. The City may also, in addition to and irrespective of the actions and
limitations established by this chapter, continue to move forward with
the habitability hearing process established separately by Chapter 94 of
the City Code, whether or not the property involved in that process has
also been placed on the abandoned property list.
A. Any interested party may submit a written request to the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee asserting that any property within
the City of Rahway should be included on the abandoned property list.
The written request must specify the street address and block and lot
number of the property to be included, and the grounds for its
inclusion. Within 30 days of receipt of any such request, the City
Business Administrator or his or her designee shall provide a written
response to the party, either indicating that the property will be added
to the list or, if not, the reasons for not adding the property. For the
purposes of this section, the term "interested parties" shall include any
resident of the City of Rahway, any owner or operator of a business
within the City of Rahway or any organization representing the
interests of residents, business owners or otherwise engaged in
furthering the revitalization and improvement of the neighborhood in
which the property is located.
B. Any interested party may participate in a redetermination hearing
regarding the inclusion of a property on the abandoned property list.
Upon written request by any interested party, the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee shall provide that party with at
least 20 days' notice of any such hearing. The party shall provide the
City Business Administrator or his or her designee with notice at least
10 days before the hearing of its intention to participate, and the nature
of the testimony or other information that it proposes to submit at the
hearing.
§ 319A-2 POOL AND BILLIARD ROOMS § 319A-4
315:429
§ 319A-5. Sale of restricted tax liens.
A. An owner may request removal of his or her property from the
abandoned properties list prior to sale of the tax sale certificate by
paying all taxes and City liens due, including interest and penalties,
and:
(1) By posting cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating all
conditions because of which the property has been determined to
be abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55 and by posting cash or
a bond to cover the cost of an environmental cleanup required on
the property, evidenced by a certification by a licensed engineer
retained by the owner and reviewed and approved by the City
Business Administrator or his or her designee, stating that the cash
or bond adequately covers the cost of the cleanup; or
(2) By demonstrating to the satisfaction of both the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee and City Council that the
conditions rendering the property abandoned have been
remediated in full; provided, however, that where the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee finds that the owner is actively
engaged in remediating the conditions because of which the
property was determined to be abandoned, as evidenced by
significant rehabilitation activity on the property, the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee may grant an extension of time
of not more than 120 days for the owner to complete all work,
during which time no further proceedings will be taken against the
owner or the property.
B. If the owner has posted cash or a bond in order to have a property
removed from the abandoned property list and the conditions because
of which the property was determined to be abandoned have not been
fully remediated within one year of the date of posting the cash or bond,
or, in the case of a property which requires a remediation of any known,
suspected or threatened release of contaminants, if the owner has
failed to enter into a memorandum of agreement with the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection or an administrative consent
order, as the case may be, or if an agreement or order is in effect but the
owner has failed to perform the remediation in conformance with the
agreement or order, then the cash or bond shall be forfeited to the City
which shall use the cash or bond and any interest which has accrued
thereon for the purpose of demolishing or rehabilitating the property or
performing the environmental remediation. Any funds remaining after
the property has been demolished, rehabilitated or cleaned up shall be
returned to the owner.
A. Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.A. 54:5-19, or the provisions of
any other law to the contrary, if a property is included on the abandoned
property list and the property taxes or other City liens due on the
property are delinquent for six or more quarters as of the date of
expiration of the right to appeal the property's inclusion on the list, or, if
§ 319A-4 RAHWAY CODE § 319A-5
315:430
an appeal has been filed, as of the date that all opportunities for appeal
of inclusion on the list have been exhausted, then the tax lien on the
property may be sold in accordance with the procedures of the Tax
Sale Law, N.J.S.A. 54:5-1 et seq., on or after the 90th day following the
expiration of that time of appeal or final determination on an appeal.
B. The City of Rahway may, at its option, require that the sale of the tax
sale certificate or any subsequent assignment or transfer of a tax sale
certificate held by the City be subject to the express condition that the
purchaser or assignee shall be obliged to perform and conclude any
rehabilitation or repairs necessary to remove the property from the
abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55 and to post a
bond in favor of the City to guarantee the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee may
waive a requirement to post a bond imposed by the City for any
purchaser, assignee or transferee of a tax sale certificate that provides
documentation acceptable to the City Business Administrator or his or
her designee that the purchaser, assignee or transferee is a qualified
rehabilitation entity as defined in N.J.S.A. 55:19-80. The cost of
rehabilitation and repairs and the cost of the bond shall be added to the
amount required to be paid by the owner for redemption of the
property. The purchaser, assignee or transferee of the tax sale
certificate who is required to rehabilitate and repair the property shall
be required to file the appropriate affidavits with the tax collector,
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-62, representing the amounts of monies
expended periodically toward the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. A purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be entitled to
interest on the amounts expended, as set forth in the affidavits, at the
delinquent rate of interest for delinquencies in excess of $1,500 in
effect for the time period when the amounts were expended, pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 54:4-67. The tax sale certificate purchaser, assignee or
transferee, with the authority of the City of Rahway, shall be permitted
to enter in and upon the property for the purposes of appraising the
costs of rehabilitation and repair and to perform all other acts required
to guarantee the completion of the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. No rehabilitation or repair work shall be commenced,
however, until proof of adequate liability insurance and an
indemnification agreement, holding the City of Rahway harmless, has
been filed with the City Business Administrator or his or her designee.
C. If the City of Rahway acquires the tax sale certificate for a property on
the abandoned property list, then, upon 10 days' written notice to the
property owner and any mortgagee as of the date of the filing of the
notice pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55, the City shall be permitted to enter
upon the property and remediate any conditions that caused the
property to be included on the abandoned property list. No remediation
shall be commenced, however, if within that ten-day period the owner
or mortgagee shall have notified the City in writing that the owner or
mortgagee has elected to perform the remediation itself. When the
owner or mortgagee elects to perform the remediation itself, it shall be
§ 319A-5 POOL AND BILLIARD ROOMS § 319A-5
315:431
§ 319A-6. Special tax sale and criteria for bidders.
required to post bond in favor of the City of Rahway in order to
ensure performance. The amount and conditions of the bond shall be
determined by the City Business Administrator or his or her designee.
D. The cost of remediation incurred by the City of Rahway, as so certified
by the entity incurring the cost upon completion of the remediation,
shall constitute a lien upon the property first in time and right to any
other lien, whether the other lien was filed prior to or after the filing of
any lien by the City, except for City taxes, liens and assessments and
any lien imposed pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act,
N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq., together with any interest thereon. The
certification of cost shall be filed and recorded as a lien by the entity
incurring the cost with the Somerset County Clerk.
E. The clearance, development, redevelopment, or repair of property
being maintained as an abandoned property pursuant to this chapter
shall be considered a public purpose and public use for which the power
of eminent domain may be lawfully exercised.
A. The City of Rahway may hold special tax sales with respect to those
properties eligible for tax sale pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 which are
also on the abandoned property list.
B. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee, with the advice
and consent of the City Council, shall establish criteria for eligibility to
bid on properties at the sale, which may include, but need not be limited
to:
(1) Documentation of the bidder's ability to rehabilitate or otherwise
reuse the property consistent with City's plans and regulations;
commitments by the bidder to rehabilitate or otherwise reuse the
property, consistent with City's plans and regulations;
(2) Commitments by the bidder to take action to foreclose on the tax
lien by a date certain; and
(3) Such other criteria as the City Business Administrator or his or her
designee, with the advice and consent of the City Council, may
determine are necessary to ensure that the properties to be sold
will be rehabilitated or otherwise reused in a manner consistent
with the public interest.
C. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee, with the advice
and consent of the City Council, may establish minimum bid
requirements for a special tax sale that are less than the full amount of
the taxes, interest and penalties due, to help ensure that the properties
will be rehabilitated or otherwise utilized in a manner consistent with
the public interest.
§ 319A-5 RAHWAY CODE § 319A-6
315:432
§ 319A-7. Expedited action to foreclose right of redemption.
D. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee, with the advice
and consent of the City Council, may combine properties in said special
tax sale into bid packages, and require that bidders place a single bid
on each package, rejecting any and all bids on individual properties that
are submitted.
E. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee, with the advice
and consent of the City Council, may sell said properties subject to
provision that, if the purchaser fails to carry out any commitment that
has been set forth as a condition of sale or misrepresents any material
qualification that has been established as a condition of eligibility to bid
pursuant thereto, then the properties and any interest thereto acquired
by the purchaser shall revert to the City, and any amount paid by the
purchaser at the special tax sale shall be forfeited to the City.
F. In the event there are two or more qualified bidders for any property or
bid package in a special tax sale, the City may designate the
unsuccessful qualified bidder whose bid was closest to the successful
bid as an eligible purchaser. In the event that the selected purchaser of
that property or bid package fails to meet any of the conditions of sale
established by the City pursuant to this section and his or her interest in
the property or properties reverts to the City, the City may
subsequently designate the entity previously designated as an eligible
purchaser as the winning bidder for the property or properties, and
assign the tax sale certificates to that entity on the basis of that entity's
bid at the special tax sale, subject to the terms and conditions of the
special tax sale.
G. The City of Rahway shall provide notice of a special tax sale pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 54:5-26. The notice shall include any special terms of sale
established by the City pursuant to this section. Nothing shall prohibit
the City from holding a special tax sale on the same day as a standard or
accelerated tax sale.
A. When a person or entity other than the City of Rahway acquires a tax
sale certificate for a property on the abandoned property list at tax sale,
the purchaser may institute an action to foreclose the right of
redemption at any time after the expiration of just six months following
the date of the sale of the tax sale certificate.
B. When the City of Rahway is the purchaser at tax sale of any property on
the abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34, an action to
foreclose the right of redemption may be instituted in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-77.
C. After the foreclosure action is instituted, the right to redeem shall exist
and continue to exist until barred by the judgment of the Superior
Court; provided, however, that no redemption shall be permitted except
where the owner:

property.
(1) Posts cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating the conditions
because of which the property was determined to be abandoned
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-56, as determined by the court; or
(2) Demonstrates to the court that the conditions because of which the
property was determined to be abandoned have been remedied in
full.
A. If an entity other than the City of Rahway has purchased or taken
assignment from the City of a tax sale certificate on a property that has
not been legally occupied for a period of six months, that property shall
not be added to the abandoned property list under the following limited
circumstances:
(1) The owner of the certificate has continued to pay all City taxes and
liens on the property in the tax year when due; and
(2) The owner of the certificate takes action to initiate foreclosure
proceedings within six months after the property is eligible for
foreclosure pursuant to either Subsection a or b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-86,
as appropriate, and diligently pursues foreclosure proceedings in a
timely fashion thereafter.
B. A property used on a seasonal basis shall be deemed abandoned only if
it meets any two of the additional criteria set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81.
C. A determination that a property is abandoned property under the
provisions of this chapter and N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. shall not
constitute a finding that the use of the property has been abandoned for
purposes of municipal zoning or land use regulation.
D. Upon the request of a purchaser or assignee of a tax sale certificate
seeking to bar the right of redemption on an abandoned property
pursuant to Subsection b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee or the tax collector shall, in a
timely fashion, provide the requester with a certification that the
property fulfills the definition of an "abandoned property" according to
the criteria established in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81 and 55:19-82.
E. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the City from addressing
concerns regarding the condition of the property through the City of
Rahway habitability hearing process, established by Chapter 94 of the
City Code, irrespective of any ongoing foreclosure proceedings.
A. A summary action or other action to transfer possession and control of
abandoned property in need of rehabilitation to the City of Rahway may
be brought by the City in the Superior Court, Somerset County. If the
§ 319A-7 RAHWAY CODE § 319A-9
315:434
Court shall find that the property is abandoned and that the owner or
party in interest has failed to submit and initiate a rehabilitation plan,
then the Court may authorize the City to take possession and control of
the property and to develop its own rehabilitation plan for the property.
B. Where the City has been granted possession and control, the City may
commence and maintain those further proceedings for the
conservation, protection or disposal of the property, or any part thereof,
that are required to rehabilitate the property, recoup the cost and
expenses of rehabilitation and for the sale of the property; provided,
however, that the Court shall not direct the sale of the property if the
owner applies to the Court for reinstatement of control and possession
of the property as permitted by N.J.S.A. 55:19-92.
C. Failure by the owner, mortgage holder or lienholder to submit a plan for
rehabilitation to the City, obtain appropriate construction permits or, in
the alternative, submit formal applications for funding the cost of
rehabilitation to local, state or federal agencies providing such funding
within the initial six-month period shall be deemed clear evidence that
the owner has failed to take any action to further the rehabilitation of
the property.
D. An owner may defend against a complaint filed pursuant to N.J.S.A.
55:19-84 by submitting a plan for the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property which is the subject of the complaint and by posting a bond
equal to 125% of the amount determined by the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee or the Court to be the projected
cost of rehabilitation.
E. Any plan submitted by an owner to defend against a complaint shall be
submitted within 60 days after the complaint has been filed, unless the
Court provides the owner with an extension of time for good cause
shown. A plan submitted by an owner pursuant to this section shall
include, but not be limited to:
(1) A detailed financial feasibility analysis, including documentation of
the economic feasibility of the proposed reuse, including operating
budgets or resale prices, or both, as appropriate;
(2) A budget for the rehabilitation of the property, including sources
and uses of funds, based on the terms and conditions of realistically
available financing, including grants and loans;
(3) A timetable for the completion of rehabilitation and reuse of the
property, including milestones for performance of major steps
leading to and encompassing the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property; and
(4) Documentation of the qualifications of the individuals and firms
that will be engaged to carry out the planning, design, financial
packaging, construction, and marketing or rental of the property.

315:435
§ 319A-10. City rehabilitation or designation of qualified
rehabilitation entity.
F. Where the Court approves the rehabilitation plan of the owner or other
party in interest, then it may appoint the City Business Administrator or
his or her designee to act as monitor of compliance and progress. If the
owner fails to carry out any step in the approved plan, then the City may
apply to the Court to have the posted bond forfeited, to transfer
possession of the building to the City to complete the rehabilitation
plan, and to grant authorization to use the bond proceeds for the
rehabilitation. The owner or other party in interest shall provide
bimonthly reports to the City Business Administrator or his or her
designee on its activities and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse
of the property.
G. If an owner is unsuccessful in defending against a complaint filed
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-84, the mortgage holder or lienholder may
seek to be designated in possession of the property by submitting a plan
and posting a bond meeting the same conditions as set forth in N.J.S.A.
55:19-87. Their plan must be submitted within 60 days following the
Court's rejection of the owner's plan, unless the Court provides the
mortgage holder or lienholder with an extension of time for good cause
shown. If the Court approves any such mortgage holder or lienholder's
plan, it shall designate that party to be in possession of the property for
purposes of ensuring its rehabilitation.
H. The mortgage holder or lienholder, as the case may be, shall provide
bimonthly reports to the Court and the City Business Administrator or
his or her designee on its activities and progress toward rehabilitation
and reuse of the property. If the mortgage holder or lienholder fails to
carry out any material step in the approved plan, then the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee shall notify the Court, which may
order the posted bond forfeit, grant the City possession of the property,
and authorize the City to use the proceeds of the bond for rehabilitation
of the property.
I. Any sums incurred or advanced for the purpose of rehabilitating the
property by a mortgage holder or lienholder granted possession of a
property, including Court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, may be
added to the unpaid balance due to that mortgage holder or lienholder,
with interest calculated at the same rate set forth in the note or security
agreement; or, in the case of a tax lienholder, at the statutory interest
rate for subsequent liens.
J. If no mortgage holder or lienholder meets the conditions of N.J.S.A.
55:19-88, then the City may submit a plan to the Court which conforms
with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-87. Such plan shall designate
whether the City or a qualified rehabilitation entity shall undertake the
rehabilitation plan in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
55:19-90.
§ 319A-9 RAHWAY CODE § 319A-10
315:436
A. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee, with the advice
and consent of the City Council, may designate a qualified rehabilitation
entity for the purpose of exercising the City's rights, where that
designation will further the rehabilitation and reuse of the property
consistent with City's plans and objectives.
B. Regardless of whether the City exercises its rights directly or the City
Business Administrator or his or her designee designates a qualified
rehabilitation entity pursuant to this section, while in possession of a
property, the City shall maintain, safeguard, and maintain insurance on
the property. Notwithstanding the City's possession of the property, the
owner of the property shall not be relieved of any civil or criminal
liability or any duty imposed by reason of acts or omissions of the
owner.
C. The Court may approve the borrowing of funds by the City of Rahway to
rehabilitate the property and may grant a lien or security interests with
priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal liens.
Prior to granting this lien priority, the Court must find as follows:
(1) The City sought to obtain the necessary financing from the senior
lienholder, which declined to provide such financing on reasonable
terms;
(2) The City sought to obtain a voluntary subordination from the senior
lienholder, which refused to provide such subordination; and
(3) Lien priority is necessary in order to induce another lender to
provide financing on reasonable terms. No lien authorized by the
Court shall take effect unless recorded with the Clerk of Somerset
County.
D. Where the City has designated a qualified rehabilitation entity to act on
its behalf, the qualified rehabilitation entity shall provide bimonthly
reports to the City Business Administrator or his or her designee on its
activities and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property.
The City or qualified rehabilitation entity, as the case may be, shall
provide such reports to the Court as the Court determines to be
necessary. If the Court finds that the City or its designee has failed to
take diligent action toward rehabilitation of the property within one
year from the grant of possession, then the Court may request the City
to designate another qualified rehabilitation entity to exercise its rights,
or if the City fails to do so, may terminate the order of possession and
return possession and control of the property to its owner.
E. The City of Rahway shall file a notice of completion with the Court, and
shall also serve a copy on the owner and any mortgage holder or
lienholder, at such time as the City has determined that no more than
six months remain to the anticipated date on which rehabilitation will
be complete. This notice shall include an affidavit of the City Business
Administrator or his or her designee, attesting that the rehabilitation is

property.
anticipated to be completed within six months, and a statement setting
forth the actions as it plans to undertake consistent with the plan.
A. An owner may petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and
possession of the property at any time after one year from the Court's
removal of possession, but no later than 30 days after the City of
Rahway has filed a notice of completion with the Court or, in the event
the notice of completion is filed within less than one year of the grant of
possession, within 30 days after the City has filed said notice.
B. The Court may allow additional time for good cause if that additional
time does not materially delay completion of the rehabilitation, place
undue hardship on the City or affect any of the terms or conditions
under which the City has applied for or received financing for the
rehabilitation of the property.
C. If the owner fails to petition for the reinstatement of control and
possession of the property within 30 days after the City has filed a
notice of completion or, in any event, within two years after the initial
grant of possession, or if the owner fails to meet any conditions that
may be set by the Court in granting a reinstatement petition, the Court
may grant the City title or authorize the City to sell the property, subject
to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-96.
A. The City Business Administrator or his or her designee, with the
approval of the Court, may place a lien on the property to cover any
costs of the City in connection with any proceeding under N.J.S.A.
55:19-78 et seq. incurred prior to the grant by the Court of an order of
possession, which may include costs incurred to stabilize or secure the
property to ensure that it can be rehabilitated in a cost-effective
manner. Any such lien shall be considered a City lien for the purposes of
N.J.S.A. 54:5-9, with the rights and status of a City lien pursuant
thereto.
B. Where the City seeks to gain title to the property, it shall purchase the
property for fair market value on such terms as the Court shall approve,
and may place the proceeds of sale in escrow with the Court.
C. The Court may authorize the City of Rahway to sell the building free
and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances, in which event all such
liens, claims and encumbrances shall be transferred to the proceeds of
sale with the same priority as existed prior to resale in accordance with
the provisions of this section, except that municipal liens shall be paid
at settlement. The proceeds of the purchase of the property shall be
distributed as set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97.

§ 319A-13. Powers of Construction Code Official not affected.
No provision of this chapter shall be construed as restricting or otherwise
abrogating the enforcement and other powers of the City's Construction
Code Official under the New Jersey Uniform Construction Code, including
without limitation N.J.S.A. 52:27D-123 et seq., and N.J.A.C. 5:23-1.1 et seq.

ARTICLE I
Title, Policy, Purposes and Definitions
§ 320-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Property Maintenance Code of the City
of Rahway" and may be referred to in this chapter as "the Code."
§ 320-2. Findings; declaration of policy.
§ 320-3. Purposes.
A. It is hereby found and declared that there are located within the City
buildings used for residential, commercial, industrial or storage
purposes which have become or are becoming substandard with
respect to structure, equipment, maintenance, occupancy, sanitation or
use. It is further declared that such conditions, which include, but are
not limited to, lack of maintenance of exterior or interior of premises,
faulty design, construction or installations, lack of proper sanitary
facilities, fire or accident hazards, unsanitary conditions, infestation or
overcrowding, have made these buildings either unfit for occupancy or
use or so deteriorated, dilapidated, dangerous, unsanitary, neglected or
over-occupied as to jeopardize or to be detrimental to the health,
morals, safety or welfare of the people of the City.
B. It is further found and declared that among other reasons, because of
lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain properties
have become blighted and have had the further effect of causing
blighting conditions within the City that have necessitated an excessive
and disproportionate expenditure of public funds for health, fire
protection, public safety, welfare and other public services. However, it
is further found and declared that through appropriate regulations and
restrictions as herein contained, the growth of blight and blighting
conditions can be curbed or prevented and neighborhood and property
values thereby maintained, the appearance and amenities of properties
and neighborhoods can be enhanced, and the public health, safety and
welfare protected and fostered.
A. The purposes of this Code are to: protect the public health, safety,
morals and welfare and to eliminate and to prevent the spread of
property and neighborhood deterioration and blight by establishing
minimum standards governing the maintenance, appearance, condition
and occupancy of residential, commercial, industrial and storage
premises; establish minimum standards governing utilities, facilities,
physical components, and conditions in such residential, commercial,
industrial and storage buildings essential to make the same fit for
occupancy or use; fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners
and operators and distinct and separate responsibilities and duties
upon occupants; authorize and establish procedures for the inspection
of premises; and for the general administration and enforcement of this

City of Rahway shall determine the equivalent household connections from
the discharge of domestic sewage from each industrial plant. This shall be
determined by dividing the average daily domestic sewerage flow by 300
gallons per day, the latter representing the average household domestic
sewage discharge. The annual rate for discharge of domestic sewerage into
the City of Rahway's sewer system shall be computed by multiplying the
number of equivalent units, as determined by the formula above, times the
A. Where the owner provides its own water supply, entirely separate from
that supplied by the City of Rahway, or provides from its own sources a
portion of the water consumed on the premises, which eventually finds
its way into the sewerage system of the City of Rahway, all
aforementioned provisions will apply. This does not relieve the owner
from the requirement to furnish, install and maintain a meter of the
indicator-register-record-type to measure the discharge of industrial
wastes, as provided herein. All costs of furnishing, installing and
maintaining the industrial waste flow meter will be borne by the owner.
B. The City of Rahway's representative shall have access at reasonable
times to industrial establishments and to any meters used to determine
waste volumes discharged into the sewer system or excluded from the

development  See Ch. 362.
Subdivision of land  See Ch. 369.
§ 361-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Stormwater Runoff
Control Ordinance of the City of Rahway."
§ 361-2. Purpose.
A. It is the purpose of the ordinance to establish minimum stormwater
requirements and controls for projects (residential and nonresidential)
that fall below the threshold of major development.
(1) All nonresidential major development site plans and nonresidential
major development subdivisions shall conform with the City of
Rahway's Stormwater Control Ordinance for Nonresidential Major
Development, Chapter 362.
(2) All residential major development site plans and residential major
development subdivisions shall conform with the latest version of
the Residential Site Improvement Standards (RSIS).73
B. It is hereby found that areas within the municipality of Rahway are
subject to recurrent flooding, that such flooding endangers life and
damages public and private property and facilities, that this condition is
aggravated by developments, that all developments contribute to the
condition by increasing local stormwater runoff and erosion and that
the most appropriate means of alleviating such condition is through the
regulation of such developments.
C. It is, therefore, determined that a special and paramount public interest
in the control of storm drainage justifies the regulation of storm
drainage for the entire municipal area as provided in this chapter,
which is in the exercise of the police power of the municipality, for the
protection of the persons and property of its inhabitants and for the
preservation of the health, safety and general welfare.
D. Among the purposes of this chapter are:
(1) To prevent loss of life.

§ 361-3. Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise, the following words shall mean as indicated:
DEVELOPMENT  The division of a parcel of land into two or more parcels,
the construction, reconstruction, conversion, structural alteration,
relocation or enlargement of any building or structure, any mining
excavation or landfill and any use or change in the use of any building
or other structure, or land or extension of use of land, by any person, for
which permission is required under the Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A.
40:55-D-1 et seq. In the case of development of agricultural lands,
"development" means: any activity that requires a state permit; any activity
reviewed by the County Agricultural Board (CAB) and the State Agricultural
Development Committee (SADC), and municipal review of any activity not
exempted by the Right to Farm Act, N.J.S.A. 4LIC-1 et seq.
MAJOR DEVELOPMENT  Any development that provides for ultimately
disturbing one or more acres of land. "Disturbance" for the purpose of this
rule is the placement of impervious surface or exposure and/or movement
of soil or bedrock or clearing, cutting, or removing of vegetation.
PERMEABILITY TEST  A test designed to determine the ability of the
ground to absorb water. The test shall be performed by a licensed
professional engineer with proven competency in the field of soils
engineering and shall be in accordance with acceptable engineering
standards and practices. A detailed report of the test shall be submitted to
the Planning Board and City Engineer for review.
PERSON  Corporations, companies, associations, societies, firms,
partnerships, and joint-stock companies, as well as individuals, the state
and all political subdivisions of the state or any agencies or
instrumentalities thereof.
RAINFALL EXCESS  The portion of rainfall which becomes direct surface
runoff.
(2) To protect the public health and promote public safety and welfare.
(3) To minimize losses and damages to public and private property due
to stormwater runoff.
(4) To prevent an increase in volume and rate of surface runoff on the
subject property or on neighboring properties due to development
or modification to natural grade. [Amended 3-13-2017 by Ord.
No. O-07-17]
(5) To reduce public expenditures for emergency operations,
evacuations and restorations.
(6) To prevent damage to transportation and utility systems.
§ 361-2 ROLLER SKATES, SKATEBOARDS AND § 361-3
331:545
STORMWATER DETENTION  Any storm drainage technique which
retards or detains runoff, such as a detention basin, parking lot storage,
rooftop storage, porous pavement, dry wells or any combination thereof.
§ 361-4. General requirements.
A. No construction or development shall take place on any site within the
municipal boundaries unless a site plan and any other required
information shall have been submitted to the Planning Board for its
review and approval, except for one- and two-family dwellings, in which
case the site plan shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
Said site plan shall meet the requirements of § 213-4A of the Code of
the City of Rahway, except that proof of stream encroachment lines
shall not be required if the entire site is not in the floodplain. The fee for
review and approval by the City Engineer under this section shall be
$250. [Amended 9-8-2008 by Ord. No. O-23-08]
B. In reviewing any proposed construction or development, the Planning
Board shall be reasonably assured that any structure, when built or
altered, can be occupied without peril to the health or safety of the
occupants and that the proposed land use does not increase local runoff
and does not increase erosion.
C. No land area shall be developed by any person such that:
(1) The volume and/or rate of stormwater runoff occurring at the area
is increased over what occurs there under existing conditions;
(2) The drainage of adjacent areas is adversely affected;
(3) Soil erosion during and after development is increased over what
naturally occurs there;
(4) Soil absorption and groundwater recharge capacity of the area is
decreased below what occurs there under existing conditions; and/
or
(5) The natural drainage pattern of the area is significantly altered.
D. In order to duplicate as nearly as possible natural drainage conditions,
regulation and control of stormwater runoff and erosion for any land
area to be developed shall be through on-site stormwater detention
and/or ground absorption systems, which include, but are not limited
to, the following: [Amended 3-13-2017 by Ord. No. O-07-17]
(1) Detention areas which may be depressions in parking areas,
excavated basins, basins created through use of curbs, stabilized
earth berms or dikes or any other form of grading which serves to
impound and store water temporarily.
(2) Rooftop storage through temporary impoundment and storage of
stormwater on flat or slightly pitched building rooftops by the use
§ 361-3 RAHWAY CODE § 361-4
331:546
§ 361-5. Design of stormwater detention facilities.
of drain outlets which restrict the stormwater runoff from the roof
surface.
(3) Dry wells or leaching basins which control stormwater runoff
through ground absorption and temporary storage.
(4) Porous asphaltic pavement, which preserves the natural ground
absorption capacity of a site and provides a subsurface reservoir
for temporary storage of stormwater.
(5) Any system of porous media, such as gravel trenches drained by
porous wall or perforated pipe, which temporarily store and
dissipate stormwater through ground absorption.
(6) Any combination of the above-mentioned techniques which serve to
limit stormwater runoff from a given site to what presently occurs
there.
(7) To the maximum extent possible, stormwater management
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural strategies
into a design, which shall conform to Chapter 362, § 362-4E(2).
E. New construction. [Added 3-13-2017 by Ord. No. O-07-17]
(1) A geotechnical investigation shall be performed to determine the
seasonal high groundwater table, where required by the City
Engineer.
(2) Where a basement is proposed, the elevation of same shall be set a
minimum of one foot above the seasonal high groundwater table or
as determined by a geotechnical engineer to minimize the need to
pump groundwater.
F. Existing structures. [Added 3-13-2017 by Ord. No. O-07-17]
(1) The property owner shall be responsible for the installation and
maintenance of the sump pump system and its appurtenances, and
shall seek applicable permits from the City or applicable governing
agency for the same.
(2) The frequency of sump pump discharge from existing structures
into a public street within the City's right-of-way shall be set such
that public health and/or safety issues and impact to the public
street created by same are minimized.
(3) The property owner shall keep the point of discharge within the
right-of-way free of debris, leaves, ice, etc., to allow an obstaclefree
flow and prevent public health or safety concerns.
A. Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to contain an amount
equal to the increase in volume of runoff which would result from the
§ 361-4 ROLLER SKATES, SKATEBOARDS AND § 361-5
331:547
development of any site. The volume of runoff shall be computed on the
basis of the total rainfall which produced the flood of record for the area
involved and shall be equivalent to the rainfall excess (i.e., the portion
of rainfall which becomes direct surface runoff). The total rainfall which
produced the flood of record shall be determined from records of the
United States Department of Commerce, National Weather Services.
B. The rainfall excess shall be computed for each site using accepted,
published runoff coefficients which reflect land use and topography.
Acceptable runoff coefficients currently in practice include, but are not
limited to, the following:
Land Use Type Runoff Coefficients
Business:
Downtown areas 0.70 to 0.95
Neighborhood areas 0.50 to 0.70
Residential:
Single-family areas 0.30 to 0.50
Multi-units, detached 0.40 to 0.60
Multi-units, attached 0.60 to 0.75
Residential (suburban) 0.25 to 0.40
Apartment dwelling areas 0.50 to 0.70
Industrial:
Light areas 0.50 to 0.80
Heavy areas 0.60 to 0.90
Parks; cemeteries 0.10 to 0.25
Playgrounds 0.20 to 0.35
Railroad yard areas 0.20 to 0.40
Unimproved areas 0.10 to 0.30
Surface Type Runoff Coefficients
Streets:
Asphaltic 0.70 to 0.95
Concrete 0.80 to 0.96
Brick 0.70 to 0.85
Drives and walks 0.75 to 0.85
Roofs 0.75 to 0.95
Lawns; sandy soil:
Flat, 2% 0.05 to 0.10
Average, 2% to 7% 0.10 to 0.15
Steep, 7% 0.15 to 0.20
§ 361-5 RAHWAY CODE § 361-5
331:548
Surface Type Runoff Coefficients
Lawns; heavy soil:
Flat, 2% 0.13 to 0.17
Average, 2% to 7% 0.18 to 0.22
Steep, 7% 0.25 to 0.35
The range of coefficients for each land use and surface type reflects
differences in land slope, intensity of development, amount of
impervious surface and degree of ground saturation due to antecedent
precipitation.
C. The runoff coefficients shall be determined for each site for both
existing and proposed conditions, and the difference in the two shall be
used to compute the volume of rainfall excess for design of stormwater
detention facilities. The volume for the design is equal to the depth of
the rainfall excess multiplied by the area of the site.
D. If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the proposed development is too
small to warrant professional engineering services or if, in the opinion
of the City Engineer, the cost of securing professional engineering
services would impose an undue economic hardship on the developer,
the City Engineer shall determine the required type and size of
stormwater detention facilities. This would not guarantee adequate
performance of such systems, since it is for the convenience of the
developer and is based on conditions that may vary.
E. In the case of detention facilities utilizing porous media for ground
absorption, such as dry wells, porous pavement or the like, the volume
of the porous media shall be large enough to contain the total volume of
rainfall excess within the voids. Ground absorption systems shall be
used only where the infiltration rate of the receiving soil is acceptable
as determined by percolation tests and soil borings or as determined by
the City Engineer. Provisions shall be made to contain overflow of such
systems on site or to surface drain the overflow in such a way as not to
affect adversely any other property.
F. If detention facilities utilizing surface impoundment, such as detention
basins or rooftop storage, are used, sufficient volume to contain fully
the total volume of rainfall excess shall be provided. The outlets of such
facilities shall be designed to limit the maximum discharge rate of
stormwater runoff to what occurs at the site under existing conditions
and shall discharge in such a way as not to affect adversely other
property. If rooftop storage is proposed, the weight of the impounded
water on the roof shall be accounted for in the structural design of the
building, and the roof shall be designed to provide maximum protection
against leakage. If earth berms or dikes are used to create the
impounding area, they shall be stabilized adequately and the slopes
protected with vegetative cover, paving or riprap to protect against
failure or breaching.
§ 361-5 ROLLER SKATES, SKATEBOARDS AND § 361-5
331:549
§ 361-6. Exclusions.
G. If a combination of different stormwater detention techniques is used,
the combined volume of the systems shall be large enough to fully
contain the total volume of rainfall excess.
H. Stormwater detention facilities shall be maintained regularly by the
owner to ensure continual functioning of the systems at design capacity
and to prevent the health hazards associated with debris buildup and
stagnant water. In no case shall water be allowed to remain in any
facility long enough to constitute a mosquito-breeding disease or any
other type of health problem. If the land containing the stormwater
detention facility or facilities is dedicated to the municipality, then the
municipality shall be responsible for maintenance.
I. In accordance with the New Jersey Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act (Chapter 251, Public Law 1975), sediment and erosion control
measures shall be installed prior to any other site development, shall
apply to all aspects of the proposed development and shall be in
operation during all stages of development. Increased runoff and
sediment, resulting from modified soil and surface conditions caused by
the proposed development, shall be minimized and, where possible,
retained on site. Detention and sediment and erosion control facilities
shall be designed in conformance with the Standard for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey of the New Jersey State Soil
Conservation Committee and administered by the Somerset-Union Soil
Conservation District.
J. Site design features identified under § 361-4D shall conform with
Chapter 362, § 362-4E(3).
A. All development in those areas of the City of Rahway which fall within
the limits of the tidal influence according to the United States Army
Corps of Engineers' New Jersey Special Flood Hazard Information
Report, 1971, shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter,
unless otherwise stated in the following subsections:
(1) Development within those areas of the City of Rahway which fall
within the limits of the tidal influence area shall only be exempt if
the increased volume of stormwater runoff shall not increase flood
damage below the point of discharge.
(2) Areas along the westerly fringe which fall within the limits of tidal
influence according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Mapping

Division of Engineering, City of Rahway.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon

D.
A. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 362-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be
met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies
into the design. If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these
standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to
meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
B. The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development and
are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water
quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain
groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major
development to the extent that alternative design and performance
standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management
plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules.
NOTE: Alternative standards shall provide at least as much protection
from stormwater-related loss of groundwater recharge, stormwater
quantity and water quality impacts of major development projects as
would be provided under the standards in N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 362-10.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through

15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad, or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at Subsection E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
§ 362-4 STORMWATER CONTROL FOR § 362-4
362:557
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into
the design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from
preconstruction to postconstruction. "Time of concentration" is
defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the
hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed;
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
(f) Minimize soil compaction;
(g) Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages
retention and planting of native vegetation and minimizes the
use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
(h) Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
§ 362-4 RAHWAY CODE § 362-4
362:558
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid
and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of
this paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,
debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
For exemptions to this standard, see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle-safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches or
is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest
dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of
spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground
surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges),
driveways, parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks,
lawns, fields, open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
§ 362-4 STORMWATER CONTROL FOR § 362-4
362:559
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register-listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 362-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 362-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
§ 362-4 RAHWAY CODE § 362-4
362:560
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surfacial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
§ 362-4 STORMWATER CONTROL FOR § 362-4
362:561
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 362-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50, 75 and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 362-2 shall be submitted to the
appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
§ 362-4 RAHWAY CODE § 362-4
362:562
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for
sale. Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 362-7, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources
of technical guidance are listed in § 362-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R =A + B - (AXB)/100
Where:
R =total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A =the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B =the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 362-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,

any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
county soil surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
§ 362-4 STORMWATER CONTROL FOR § 362-4
362:565
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top-of-bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subparagraph shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
§ 362-4 RAHWAY CODE § 362-4
362:566
§ 362-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and soil conservation district
staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway, subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
§ 362-4 STORMWATER CONTROL FOR § 362-5
362:567
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The rational method for peak flow and the modified rational
method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 362-5A(1)(a) and the rational and
modified rational methods at § 362-5A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient or
a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn,
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications, as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 -Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hard design flood elevation as defined at
N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Groundwater Recharge Areas in New Jersey,

minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 362-8D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 362-8.

facilities, as well as retail and transit centers within the community,
where feasible.
B. Provide safe and accessible accommodations for existing and future
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities.
C. As all streets are different, establish a procedure to evaluate new
streets and resurfacing projects for complete streets inclusion

constraints, right-of-way limitations, funding resources, and bicycle
and/or pedestrian compatibility.
D. Transportation facilities are long-term investments that shall anticipate
likely future demand for bicycling and walking facilities and not
preclude the provision of future improvements.
E. Address the need for bicyclists and pedestrians to cross corridors. Even
where bicyclists and pedestrians may not commonly use a particular
travel corridor that is being improved or constructed, they will likely
need to be able to cross that corridor safely and conveniently.
Therefore, the design of intersections, interchanges, and bridges shall
accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians in a manner that is safe,
accessible, and convenient.
F. Design bicycle and pedestrian facilities to the best currently available

roads, bridges, or sidewalks for construction projects as outlined in
NJDOT Policy No. 705, Accommodating Pedestrian and Bicycle Traffic
During Construction.

schools, safe routes to transit, transit villages, trail crossings, and areas
or population groups with limited transportation options.
I. Improvements shall comply with Title VII Environmental Justice,
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)78 and complement the context of
the surrounding community.
J. Exemptions.
(1) Exemptions to the complete streets policy shall be presented for
final decision to the Municipal Engineer, in writing, and
documented with supporting data that indicates the reason for the
decision and are limited to the following:
(a) Nonmotorized users are prohibited on the roadway.
(b) There is insufficient space in an existing right-of-way to design
a complete street.
(c) Scarcity of population, travel and attractors, both existing and
future, indicate an absence of need for such accommodations.
(d) Detrimental environment or social impacts outweigh the need
for these accommodations.
(e) The cost of accommodations is excessively disproportionate to
cost of project.
(f) The safety or timing of a project is compromised by the
inclusion of complete streets.
(2) An exemption other than those listed above must be documented
with supporting data and must be approved by the Municipal
Engineer.

§ 401-40. Definitions.
The following words and phrases, which are not defined in Subtitle 1 of
Title 39 of the New Jersey Statutes Annotated, shall have the meanings
respectively ascribed to them in this section for purposes of this article:
PARKING METER  Any mechanical device or meter not inconsistent with
this article placed or erected for the regulation of parking by authority of
this article. Each parking meter installed shall indicate by proper legend the
legal parking time established by the ordinance and, when operated, shall
at all times indicate the balance of legal parking time and, at the expiration
of such period, shall indicate illegal or overtime parking.
PARKING METER SPACE  Any space within a parking meter zone, which
is adjacent to a parking meter and which is duly designated for the parking
of a single vehicle by lines painted or otherwise durably marked on the curb
or on the surface of the street or lot adjacent to or adjoining the parking
meters.
PARKING METER ZONE  Any restricted on-street parking area or offstreet
parking lot upon which meters are installed and in operation.
§ 401-41. Designation of parking spaces.
The Police Department is hereby directed and authorized to provide for
the marking off of individual parking spaces in the parking meter zones
designated and described in Schedule XXIV (§ 401-83), said parking spaces
to be designated by lines painted or marked on the curbing or surface of the
street or lot. At each space so marked off, it shall be unlawful to park any
vehicle in such a way that said vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits
of the space so designated.
§ 401-42. Installation of parking meters.
In said parking meter zones, the Parking Authority shall cause parking
meters to be installed upon the curb, sidewalk or area immediately adjacent
to the parking spaces provided in § 401-41 of this article. No parking meters
shall be installed in areas where parking is prohibited pursuant to the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 39:4-138. The Parking Authority shall be responsible
for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and use of such parking
meters. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal
parking upon the deposit of the appropriate coin, lawful money of the
United States of America, for the period of time prescribed in § 401-43.
Each device shall be so arranged that upon the expiration of the lawful time
limit it will indicate by a proper, visible signal that the lawful parking period
has expired, and in such case the right of such vehicle to occupy such space
shall cease, and the operator, owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be
subject to the penalties hereinafter provided.
§ 401-40 VEHICLES, ABANDONED OR INOPERABLE § 401-43
397:679
§ 401-43. Operation of parking meters.
Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Fire or
Police Department, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer
or traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any
parking space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the
operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering the said parking meter space,
immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper coin
of the United States of America as is required for such parking meter and
as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required by
the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the deposit
of the proper coin, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on such
meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon, and failure
to deposit such proper coin and to set the timing mechanism in operation
when so required shall constitute a violation of this article. Upon the deposit
of such coin (and the setting of the timing mechanism in operation when
so required), the parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle
during the period of time which has been prescribed for the part of the
street which said parking space is located, provided that any person placing
a vehicle in a parking meter space adjacent to a meter which indicates that
unused time has been left in the meter by the previous occupant of the
space shall not be required to deposit a coin so long as his occupancy of said
space does not exceed the indicated unused parking time. If said vehicle
shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the parking time
limit set for such parking space and if the meter shall indicate such illegal
parking, then and in that event such vehicle shall be considered as parking
overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such parking
shall be deemed a violation of this article.
§ 401-44. Manner of parking.
When a parking meter space is parallel with the adjacent curb or sidewalk,
no person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking
space in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle
nearest to the parking meter. When a parking meter space is diagonal to
the curb or sidewalk, no person shall park or permit the parking of any
vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost
part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter. When a parking meter
shall have been installed at the head of and immediately adjacent to any
parking space on a municipal off-street parking lot, no person shall park or
permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space in any other position
than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter;
provided, however, that in municipal off-street parking lots, signs shall be
erected indicating that head-on parking only is permitted. In any event, a
vehicle shall be parked within the lines marked on the pavement measuring
such parking space.

vehicle, and payment of any fine or penalty and court costs assessed
against the owner of the vehicle for the violations which gave rise to the
impoundment or immobilization of said vehicle, including any

A member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment who was absent for one or
more of the meetings at which a hearing was held shall be eligible to vote

Board member has available to him the transcript or recording of all of the
hearings from which he was absent and certifies in writing to the Board that
he has read such transcript or listened to such recording.
§ 53-14. Quorum; organization.
§ 53-15. Powers and duties.
The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to:

governing body for cause.

specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional topographical
conditions, or by reason of other extraordinary and exceptional
situation or condition of such piece of property, the strict application of
any zoning regulation would result in peculiar and exceptional practical
difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the developer of
such property, grant, upon an application or an appeal relating to such
property, a variance from such strict application of such regulation so
as to relieve such difficulties or hardship; provided, however, that no
variance shall be granted under this subsection to allow a structure or
use in a district restricted against such structure or use; and provided

Planning Board of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use in
§ 53-12 RAHWAY CODE § 53-15
419:828
conjunction with which the Planning Board shall review the request for

such structure or use, but only by affirmative vote of at least five
members.

pursuant to this chapter before adoption of the Official Map, except as
herein provided. Whenever one or more parcels of land upon which is

control basin or public area reserved on the Official Map cannot yield a
reasonable return to the owner unless a building permit is granted, the
Board of Adjustment may, in a specific case, by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the full authorized membership of the Board, direct the
issuance of a permit for a building or structure in the bed of such
mapped street or public drainageway or flood control basin or public
area reserved on the Official Map, which will, as little as practicable,
increase the cost of opening such street or tend to cause a minimum
change of the Official Map, and the Board shall impose reasonable
requirements as a condition of granting the permit so as to promote the
health, morals, safety and general welfare of the public.
F. No permit for the erection of any building or structure shall be issued
unless the lot abuts a street giving access to such proposed building or
structure. Such street shall have been duly placed on the Official Map
or shall be an existing state, county or municipal street or highway or a
street shown upon a plat approved by the Planning Board or a street on
a plat duly filed in the office of the county recording officer prior to the
passage of an ordinance under the Land Use Act or any prior law which
required prior approval of plats by the governing body or other
authorized body. Before any such permit shall be issued, such street
shall have been certified to be suitably improved to the satisfaction of
§ 53-15 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 53-15

§ 53-18. Time for decision.
the governing body, or such suitable improvement shall have been
assured by means of a performance guaranty, in accordance with
standards and specification for road improvements approved by the
governing body, as adequate in respect to the public health, safety and
general welfare of the special circumstance of the particular street.
Where the enforcement of this section would entail practical difficulty
or unnecessary hardship or where the circumstances of the case do not
require the building or structure to be related to a street, the Board of
Adjustment may, upon application or appeal, vary the application of this
section and direct the issuance of a permit, subject to conditions that
will provide adequate access for fire-fighting equipment, ambulances
and other emergency vehicles necessary for the protection of health
and safety and that will protect any future street layout shown on the
Official Map or on a general circulation plan element of the Municipal
Master Plan.
A. The governing body shall make provision in its budget and appropriate
funds for the expenses of the Board of Adjustment.
B. The Board of Adjustment may employ or contract for and fix the
compensation of legal counsel other than the Municipal Attorney and
experts and other staff and services as it shall deem necessary, not
exceeding, exclusive of gifts or grants, the amount appropriated by the
governing body for its use.
A. A developer may file an application for development with the
administrative officer without prior application to any other municipal
official.
B. A developer may file an application for development with the Board of
Adjustment for action under any of its powers without prior application
to an administrative officer.

after the date:
(1) An appeal is taken from the decision of an administrative officer; or
(2) The submission of a complete application for development to the
Board of Adjustment.
B. Failure of the Board to render a decision within such one-hundredtwenty-
day period or within such further time as may be consented to
by the applicant shall constitute a decision favorable to the applicant.
§ 53-15 RAHWAY CODE § 53-19
419:830
§ 53-19. Modification on appeal.
The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or
may modify the action, order, requirement, decision, interpretation or
determination appealed from and, to that end, have all the powers of the
administrative officer from whom the appeal is taken.
§ 53-20. Stay of proceedings by appeal; exception.
An appeal to the Board of Adjustment shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action with respect to which the decision appealed from
was made unless the officer from whose action the appeal is taken certifies
to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been
filed with him, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an order of the Superior
Court, upon notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown.

application within 120 days after submission by a developer of a complete
application to the administrative officer or within such further time as may
be consented to by the applicant. Failure of the Board of Adjustment to act
within the period prescribed shall constitute approval of the application,

extent and subject to the same restrictions as the Planning Board,
subdivision or site plan approval whenever the proposed development
requires approval by the Board of Adjustment of a use variance.

approval of the variance and a subsequent application for any required
approval of a subdivision or site plan.
C. The separate approval of the variance shall be conditioned upon the
granting of all required subsequent approvals by the Board of
Adjustment.
D. No such subsequent approval shall be granted unless such approval can
be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and
without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the Zone
Plan and Chapter 421, Zoning.
E. The number of votes of Board members required to grant any such
subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in this chapter for
the approval in question, and the special vote for a use variance shall
not be required.
§ 53-19 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 53-22
419:831
and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure of the Board of
Adjustment to act shall be issued on request of the applicant, and it shall be
sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of approval
herein required and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for
purposes of filing subdivision plats.

(c) Points: fire hydrants, utility poles, utility valves, manholes,
catch basins, well locations, etc.
A. Site plan.
(1) It is required that the developer submit a site plan and such other
information as is reasonably necessary to make an informed
decision as to whether the requirements necessary for preliminary
site plan approval have been met. The site plan and any
engineering documents to be submitted shall be required in
tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary approval.
Architectural plans are required to be submitted for site plan
approval, and the preliminary plans and elevations shall be
sufficient.
(2) If the Planning Board requires any substantial amendment in the
layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been
the subject of a hearing, an amended application for development
shall be submitted and proceeded upon as in the case of the
original application for development. The Planning Board shall, if
the proposed development complies with the ordinance and this
chapter, grant preliminary site plan approval.
(3) Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete
application for a site plan for 10 acres of land or less and 10
§ 53-34 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 53-36
419:849
dwelling units or less, the Planning Board shall grant or deny
preliminary approval within 45 days of the date of such submission
or within such further time as may be consented to by the
developer. Upon the submission of a complete application for a site
plan of more than 10 acres or more than 10 dwelling units, the
Planning Board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 95
days of the date of such submission or within such further time
as may be consented to by the developer. Otherwise, the Planning
Board shall be deemed to have granted preliminary approval of the
site plan.
(4) Minor site plan. Whenever a site plan is required to be submitted
for a development, the municipal agency may classify the site plan
as minor and waive any of the preliminary and final site plan
requirements when the site is being disturbed by 10% or less of its
land area or 10% or less of its building area and land area
combined. The applicant shall submit, in writing, to the
administrative officer a list of those requirements that he desires to
have waived, and the agency shall make its determination
accordingly.
(5) Notice of hearing. The notice of hearings and the public hearing on
applications for development for minor site plans may be waived if
the Planning Board or Site Plan Subcommittee of the Board
appointed by the Chairman finds that the application for
development conforms to the definition of "minor site plan." Minor
site plan approval shall be deemed to be final approval of the site
plan by the Board, provided that the Board or said Subcommittee
may condition such approval on terms ensuring the provision of
improvements pursuant to this chapter.
(6) Minor site plan approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days
of the date of submission of a complete application to the
administrative officer or within such further time as may be
consented to by the applicant. Failure of the Planning Board to act
within the period prescribed shall constitute minor site plan
approval.
(7) The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions,
whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor site plan
approval was granted shall not be changed for a period of two years
after the date of minor site plan approval.
B. Minor subdivision.
(1) It is required that a developer submit minor subdivisions to the
Planning Board for approval. Minor subdivision approval shall be
deemed to be final approval of the subdivision by the Board,
provided that the Board may condition such approval on terms
ensuring the provision of certain improvements permitted by law.
§ 53-36 RAHWAY CODE § 53-36
419:850
(2) Minor subdivision approval shall be granted or denied within 45
days of the date of submission of a complete application to the
Secretary of the municipal agency or within such further time as
may be consented to by the applicant. Failure of the Planning Board
to act within the period prescribed shall constitute minor
subdivision approval, and a certificate of the administrative officer
as to the failure of the Planning Board to act shall be issued on
request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the
written endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required
and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for
purposes of filing subdivision plats.
(3) Approval of a minor subdivision shall expire 190 days from the date
of municipal approval unless within such period a plat in
conformity with such approval and the provisions of the Map Filing
Law91 or a deed clearly describing the approved minor subdivision
is filed by the developer with the county recording officer, the
Municipal Engineer and the Municipal Tax Assessor. Any such plat
or deed accepted for such filing shall have been signed by the
Chairman and Secretary of the Planning Board. In reviewing the
application for development for a proposed minor subdivision, the
Planning Board may be permitted to accept a plat not in conformity
with the Map Filing Act, provided that, if the developer chooses to
file the minor subdivision as provided herein by plat rather than
deed, such plat shall conform to the provisions of said Act.
(4) The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions,
whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision
approval was granted shall not be changed for a period of two years
after the date of minor subdivision approval, provided that the
approved minor subdivision shall have been duly recorded as
provided in this section.
C. Major subdivision.
(1) It is required that a developer submit major subdivisions to the
Planning Board for approval and shall require that the developer
submit to the Secretary of the municipal agency a plat or such
other information as is reasonably necessary to make an informed
decision as to whether the requirements necessary for preliminary
approval have been met, provided that minor subdivisions pursuant
to this chapter shall not be subject to this section. The plat and any
other engineering documents to be submitted shall be required in
tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary approval.
(2) If the Planning Board requires any substantial amendment in the
layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been
the subject of a hearing, an amended application shall be submitted
and proceeded upon as in the case of the original application for
91.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.
§ 53-36 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 53-36
419:851
§ 53-37. Effect of preliminary approval.
development. The Planning Board shall, if the proposed subdivision
complies with this chapter, grant preliminary approval to the
subdivision.
(3) Upon the submission to the Secretary of a complete application for
a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots, the Planning Board shall grant or
deny preliminary approval within 45 days of the date of such
submission or within such further time as may be consented to by
the developer. Upon the submission of a complete application for a
subdivision of more than 10 lots, the Planning Board shall grant or
deny preliminary approval within 95 days of the date of such
submission or within such further time as may be consented to by
the developer. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall be deemed to
have granted preliminary approval to the subdivision.
A. Preliminary approval of a major subdivision or of a site plan shall,
except as provided in Subsection A(4) of this section, confer upon the
applicant the following rights for a three-year period from the date of
the preliminary approval:
(1) That the general terms and conditions on which preliminary
approval was granted shall not be changed, including but not
limited to use requirements, layout and design standards for
streets, curbs and sidewalks, lot size, yard dimensions and off-tract
improvements and, in the case of a site plan, any requirements
peculiar to site plan approval, except that nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent the municipality from modifying, by
ordinance, such general terms and conditions of preliminary
approval as relate to public health and safety.
(2) That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before the
expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or a section or
sections of the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan, as the case
may be.
(3) That the applicant may apply for and the Planning Board may grant
extensions on such preliminary approval for additional periods of at
least one year but not to exceed a total extension of two years,
provided that if the design standards have been revised by
ordinance, such revised standards may govern.
(4) In the case of a subdivision of or site plan for an area of 50 acres or
more, the Planning Board may grant the rights referred to in
Subsection A(1), (2) and (3) above for such period of time, longer
than three years, as shall be determined by the Planning Board to
be reasonable, taking into consideration:
(a) The number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area
permissible under preliminary approval.
§ 53-36 RAHWAY CODE § 53-37
419:852
§ 53-38. Exceptions.
The Planning Board, when acting upon applications for preliminary or minor
subdivision approval or preliminary site plan approval, shall have the power
to grant such exceptions from the requirements for subdivision approval
as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the
provisions for subdivision review and approval of an ordinance adopted
pursuant to this chapter if the literal enforcement of one or more provisions
of the chapter are impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question.
§ 53-39. Final approval of site plans and major subdivisions.
(b) Economic conditions.
(c) The comprehensiveness of the development.
B. The applicant may apply for thereafter, and the Planning Board may
thereafter grant, an extension to preliminary approval for such
additional period of time as shall be determined by the Planning Board
to be reasonable, taking into consideration:
(1) The number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area
permissible under preliminary approval.
(2) The potential number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor
area of the section or sections awaiting final approval.
(3) Economic conditions.
(4) The comprehensiveness of the development, provided that, if the
design standards have been revised, such revised standards may
govern.
A. The Planning Board shall grant final approval if the detailed drawings,
specifications and estimates of the application for final approval
conform to the standards established by ordinance for final approval,
the conditions of preliminary approval and, in the case of a major
subdivision, the standards prescribed by the Map Filing Law,92 provided
that, in the case of a residential cluster, the Planning Board may permit
minimal deviations from the conditions of preliminary approval
necessitated by change of conditions beyond the control of the
developer since the date of preliminary approval without the developer
being required to submit another application for development for
preliminary approval.
B. Final approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days after the
submission of a complete application to the Secretary or within such
further time as may be consented to by the applicant. Failure of the
Planning Board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute final
92.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.
§ 53-37 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 53-39
419:853
approval, and a certificate of the Secretary as to the failure of the
Planning Board to act shall be issued on request of the applicant, and it
shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence
of approval herein required and shall be so accepted by the county
recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats.
C. As a condition for approval of a subdivision or site plan, a developer
shall pay his pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and
necessary street improvements and water, sewerage and drainage
facilities and easements therefor, located outside the property limits of
the subdivision or development but necessitated or required by
construction or improvements within such subdivision or development.
Such payments shall be based on circulation and comprehensive utility
service plans as required in the Master Plan and shall be established by
fair and reasonable standards to determine the proportionate or pro
rata amount of the cost of such facilities that shall be borne by each
developer or owner within a related and common area, which standards
shall not be altered subsequent to preliminary approval. Where a
developer pays the amount determined as his pro rata share under
protest, he shall institute legal action within one year of such payment
in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to the
fairness and reasonableness of such amount.
D. Effect of final approval of a site plan or major subdivision.
(1) The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval
first granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer
pursuant to this chapter, whether conditionally or otherwise, shall
not be changed for a period of two years after the date of final
approval, provided that, in the case of a major subdivision, the
rights conferred by this section shall expire if the plat has not been
duly recorded within the time period required by this chapter. If the
developer has followed the standards prescribed for final approval
and, in the case of a subdivision, has duly recorded the plat as
required, the Planning Board may extend such period of protection
for extensions of one year, but not to exceed three extensions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the granting
of final approval shall terminate the time period of preliminary
approval for the section granted final approval.
(2) In the case of a subdivision or site plan for a residential cluster of
50 acres or more or conventional subdivision or site plan for 150
acres or more, the Planning Board may grant the rights referred to
in Subsection D(2) for such period of time, longer than two years,
as shall be determined by the Planning Board to be reasonable,
taking into consideration:
(a) The number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area
permissible under final approval.
(b) Economic conditions.
§ 53-39 RAHWAY CODE § 53-39
419:854
§ 53-40. Guaranties required; surety; release.
(c) The comprehensiveness of the development.
E. The developer may apply for thereafter, and the Planning Board may
thereafter grant, an extension of final approval for such additional
period of time as shall be determined by the Planning Board to be
reasonable, taking into consideration:
(1) The number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area
permissible under final approval.
(2) The number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area
remaining to be developed.
(3) Economic conditions.
(4) The comprehensiveness of the development.
A. Before the recording of final subdivision plats or as a condition of final
site plan approval or as a condition to the issuance of a zoning permit,
the approving authority may require and shall accept, in accordance
with the standards adopted by ordinance for the purpose of assuring
the installation and maintenance of on-tract improvements and a pro
rata share of off-tract improvements as permitted by law:
(1) The furnishing of a performance guaranty in favor of the
municipality in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of
installation for improvements it may deem necessary or
appropriate, including streets, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs,
sidewalks, streetlighting, shade trees, surveyor's monuments, as
shown on the final map and required by the Map Filing Law,93
water mains, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other
means of sewage disposal, drainage structures, erosion control and
sedimentation control devices, public improvements of open space
and, in the case of site plans only, other on-site improvements and
landscaping. The performance guaranty shall be comprised of a
minimum of 10% cash. [Amended 11-9-2009 by Ord. No.
O-39-09]
(2) Provision for a maintenance guaranty to be posted with the
governing body for a period not to exceed two years after final
acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed 15% of
the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental
agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be
installed or the improvements are covered by a performance or
maintenance guaranty to another governmental agency, no
performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case may be, shall be
required by the municipality for such utilities or improvements.
93.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.
§ 53-39 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 53-40
419:855
(3) The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the
governing body by resolution. As a condition or as part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guaranty shall be
increased or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to
exceed 120% of the cost of the installation as determined as of the
time of the passage of the resolution.
B. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the municipality for the reasonable cost of
the improvements not completed or corrected, and the municipality
may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof,
complete such improvements.
C. Upon substantial completion of all required appurtenant utility
improvements and the connection of same to the public system, the
obligor may notify the governing body, in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Municipal Clerk, of the completion or
substantial completion of improvements and shall send a copy thereof
to the Municipal Engineer. Thereupon, the Municipal Engineer shall
inspect all improvements of which such notice has been given and shall
file a detailed report, in writing, with the governing body, indicating
either approval, partial approval or rejection of such improvements,
with a statement of reasons for any rejection. The cost of the
improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth.
D. The governing body shall either approve, partially approve or reject the
improvements on the basis of the report of the Municipal Engineer and
shall notify the obligor, in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of
said report and the action of said approving authority with relation
thereto, not later than 65 days after receipt of the notice from the
obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial approval
is granted, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
performance guaranty, except for that portion adequately sufficient to
secure provision of the improvements not yet approved, provided that
30% of the amount of the performance guaranty posted may be retained
to ensure completion of all improvements. Failure of the governing
body to send or provide such notification to the obligor within 65 days
shall be deemed to constitute approval of the improvements, and the
obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from all liability pursuant to
such performance guaranty for such improvements.
E. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and,
upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
F. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
governing body or the Municipal Engineer.
§ 53-40 RAHWAY CODE § 53-40
419:856
§ 53-41. Recording of final approval of major subdivision.
Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from the date of
signing of the plat unless within such period the plat shall have been duly
filed by the developer with the county recording officer. The Planning Board
may, for good cause shown, extend the period for recording for an additional
period not to exceed 190 days from the date of signing of the plat.
§ 53-42. Filing of all subdivision plats.
§ 53-43. Penalty for selling before approval.
If, before final subdivision approval has been granted, any person transfers
or sells or agrees to transfer or sell, except pursuant to an agreement
expressly conditioned on final subdivision approval, as owner or agent, any
land which forms a part of a subdivision for which municipal approval is
required by ordinance pursuant to this chapter, such person shall be subject
to a penalty not to exceed $1,000, and each lot disposition so made shall be
deemed a separate violation.
§ 53-44. Suits.
In addition to the foregoing, the municipality may institute and maintain
a civil action for injunctive relief and to set aside and invalidate any
G. The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for all reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Municipal Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of improvements, provided that the municipality may require
of the developer a deposit for all or a portion of the reasonably
anticipated fees to be paid to the Municipal Engineer for such
inspection.
H. In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development
pursuant to this chapter, the provisions of this section shall be applied
by stage or section.
A. No subdivision plat shall be accepted for filing by the county recording
officer until it has been approved by the Planning Board as indicated on
the instrument by the signature of the Chairman and Secretary of the
Planning Board or a certificate has been issued pursuant to this
chapter. The signatures of the Chairman and Secretary of the Planning
Board shall not be affixed until the developer has posted the guaranties
required pursuant to this chapter. If the county recording officer
records any plat without such approval, such recording shall be deemed
null and void, and, upon request of the municipality, the plat shall be
expunged from the official records.
B. It shall be the duty of the county recording officer to notify the Planning
Board in writing within seven days of the filing of any plat, identifying
such instrument by its title, date of filing and official number.
§ 53-40 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 53-44
419:857
conveyance made pursuant to such a contract of sale if a certificate of
compliance has not been issued in accordance with this chapter.
§ 53-45. Lien.
In any such action, the transferee, purchaser or grantee shall be entitled
to a lien upon the portion of the land from which the subdivision was made
that remains in the possession of the developer or his assigns or successors,
to secure the return of any deposits made or purchase price paid, and also,
a reasonable search fee, survey expense and title crossing expense, if any.
Any such action must be brought within two years after the date of the
recording of the instrument of transfer, sale or conveyance of said land or
within six years, if unrecorded.
§ 53-46. Certificate showing approval; contents; fees.
§ 53-47. Right of owner of land covered by certificate.
A. The prospective purchaser, prospective mortgagee or any other person
interested in any land which forms part of a subdivision, or which
formed part of such a subdivision three years preceding the effective
date of this chapter, may apply in writing to the Secretary of the
municipal agency for the issuance of a certificate certifying whether or
not such subdivision has been approved by the Planning Board. Such
application shall contain a diagram showing the location and dimension
of the land to be covered by the certificate and the name of the owner
thereof. The Secretary shall make and issue such certificate within 15
days after the receipt of such written application and the fees therefor.
Said Secretary shall keep a duplicate copy of each certificate,
consecutively numbered, including a statement of the fee charged, in a
binder as a permanent record of his office. Each such certificate shall
be designated a "certificate as to approval of subdivision of land," and
shall certify:
(1) Whether there exists in said municipality a duly established
Planning Board and whether there is an ordinance controlling
subdivision of land adopted under the authority of Chapter 291 of
the Laws of New Jersey 1975.
(2) Whether the subdivision, as it relates to the land shown in said
application, has been approved by the Planning Board and, if so,
the date of such approval and any extensions and terms thereof,
showing that subdivision on which the lands are a part is a validly
existing subdivision.
(3) Whether such subdivision, if the same has not been approved, is
statutorily exempt from the requirement of approval as provided in
this chapter.
B. A fee of $3 shall be charged for each certificate.
§ 53-44 RAHWAY CODE § 53-47
419:858
§ 53-48. Conditional uses.
A. Any person who shall acquire for a valuable consideration an interest in
the lands covered by any such certificate of approval of a subdivision in
reliance upon the information therein contained shall hold such interest
free of any right, remedy or action which could be prosecuted or
maintained by the municipality pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter.
B. If the Secretary designated to issue any such certificate fails to issue
the same within 15 days after receipt of an application and the fees
therefor, any person acquiring an interest in the lands described in such
application shall hold such interest free of any right, remedy or action
which could be prosecuted or maintained by the municipality pursuant
to this chapter.
C. Any such application addressed to the Clerk of the municipality shall be
deemed to be addressed to the proper designated officer, and the
municipality shall be bound thereby to the same extent as though the
same was addressed to the designated official.
A. All applicants shall be required to submit a development application
pursuant to this chapter for conditional uses, formerly called "special
exceptions."
B. The Planning Board shall grant or deny an application for a conditional
use within 95 days of submission of a complete application by a
developer to the Secretary or within such further time as may be
consented to by the applicant.
C. The review by the Planning Board of a conditional use shall include any
required site plan review pursuant to this chapter. The time period for
action by the Planning Board on conditional uses pursuant to
Subsection B of this section shall apply to such site plan review. Failure
of the Planning Board to act within the period prescribed shall
constitute approval of the application, and a certificate of the Secretary
as to the failure of the Planning Board to act shall be issued on request
of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written
endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required and shall be
so accepted by the county recording officer for purposes of filing
subdivision plats if involved.

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
§ 213-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Rahway, of New
Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 213-2. Findings of fact.
§ 213-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Rahway are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 213-1 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 213-3
419:873
§ 213-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and,
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

systems, and streets and bridges.
(5) Upon consideration of the factors of § 213-15A(4) and the purposes
of this chapter, the Planning Board may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
(6) The City Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the
Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
Subsections A(4)(a) through (k) in § 213-15A(4) have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures, upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 213-15A(4), or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
§ 213-15 RAHWAY CODE § 213-15
419:888
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
C. Appeals. An appeal from any decision of the Planning Board which is
made pursuant to any provision of this chapter shall be taken according
to the procedures of §§ 53-51 and 53-52 of the Land Use Procedures
Chapter.99

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 213-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base
flood elevation or together with the attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall;
(2) Be required within any AO or AH Zone on the municipality's FIRM
that all new construction and substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall
either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above
the highest adjacent grade, at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number is specified),

§ 213-19. Preservation of natural systems.
It is hereby found that natural floodplains display complex intimate
relationships among streams, periodic flooding, soils, vegetation, fish and
wildlife and that periodic flooding of lowland areas, marshes and swamps
adjacent to stream channels produces a rich physical - chemical
environment for many living organisms. It is further found that floodplains
contain biological communities which are among the most productive of
natural systems and perform the following functions essential to the natural
environment:
§ 213-20. Permitted land use.
A. Passage and storage of storm floodwaters.
B. Removal of sediment loads from streams through deposition.
C. Replenishment of groundwater supplies through soil infiltration.
D. Dissipation of energy of flood flows, thereby reducing downstream
destruction.

§ 213-20 RAHWAY CODE § 213-21
419:896
permit or other approval issued by the Department. Notice of a
hearing on an application for development shall be given by the
applicant in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 53, Land
Use Procedures.
(2) Such notifications shall include the name and address of the
applicant, the location of the proposed use and an abbreviated
description of the proposed use, and announcement as to where
and at what times the complete application may be reviewed and to
whom and by what date interested parties may communicate their
positions concerning the application and any data that they may
have developed in reference to the effects of the proposed use. The
Planning Board shall review the restricted use permit application
and all information received from interested parties under
§ 213-14B. The Building Inspector shall issue a permit only if the
Planning Board finds that the proposed use:
(a) Has low flood-damage potential.

quality and quantity of groundwaters.
D. In reviewing the permit application and arriving at its finding, the
Planning Board shall consult with the City Engineer and consider the
following criteria:
(1) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
(2) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
(3) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
insulation of these systems from disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions resulting from flooding.
(4) The susceptibility of the proposed use to flood damage and the
effects of such damage.
(5) The need for a waterfront location.
(6) The availability of alternate locations not subject to flooding.
§ 213-21 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 213-21
419:897
(7) The duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of floodwaters
expected at the site.

disrupted.
(10) The degree to which the proposed use serves the general public's
health, safety and welfare.
(11) The degree to which any aspect of food chain or plant, animal, fish
or human life processes are affected adversely within or beyond the
proposed use area.
(12) The degree to which the proposed activity alters natural water flow
or water temperature.
(13) The degree to which the proposed use provides facilities for the
proper handling of litter, trash, refuse and sanitary and industrial
waste.
(14) The degree to which irreplaceable land types will be destroyed.
(15) The degree to which the natural, scenic and aesthetic values at the
proposed activity site can be retained.
(16) The degree to which materials not subject to major damage by
floods are firmly anchored to prevent flotation and/or are readily
removable from the area within the time available after flood
warning.
E. If the Planning Board finds that the proposed use would violate or tend
to violate the purposes and intent of this chapter, the Planning Board
may deny the application or may approve the application and impose
such permit conditions as are necessary to promote the public safety,
health and welfare, to protect public and private property, wildlife and
fisheries and to preserve, protect and enhance the natural environment
of the floodplain. These conditions may include, but are not limited to,
the following:
(1) Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
(2) Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed restrictions.
(3) Requirements for construction of stormwater detention facilities
channel modifications, dikes, levees and other protective
measures.
(4) Installation of an adequate flood-warning system.
§ 213-21 RAHWAY CODE § 213-21
419:898
(5) Postponement of development until such time as protective
measures are installed or until the floodway and flood hazard area
have been delineated by the Department or municipality.
F. Within all special flood hazard areas, where applicable, the Planning
Board shall condition restricted use permits as follows:
(1) Fill shall be no lower than one foot above the flood hazard elevation
and shall extend at such height for a distance of at least 15 feet
beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon.
(2) Structures on fill shall be built so that the first floor and/or
basements are at a minimum of one foot above the flood hazard
elevation.
(3) Structures not placed on fill shall be otherwise elevated so that the
lowest floor is at a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or shall be floodproofed to a minimum of one foot above
the base flood elevation. Floodproofing alone shall not be adequate
for single and multifamily residences, hospitals, nursing homes,
school day-care centers and similar uses.
(4) Enclosure opening. For all new construction and substantial
improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must
either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

parking, off-street loading and service facilities shall be graded and
drained so as to dispose of all surface water accumulation in a safe
manner while preventing damage to abutting properties and/or
public streets and shall be surfaced with asphaltic, bituminous
cement or other properly bound pavement which will assure a
§ 349-4 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 349-5
419:911
surface resistant to erosion. Such drainage and materials shall be
installed as required by the Planning Board and as recommended
by the City Engineer. All such areas shall be at all times maintained,
at the expense of the owners thereof, in a clean, orderly and dustfree
condition.
(3) Separation from walkways and streets. All off-street parking, offstreet
loading and service areas shall be separated from walkways,
sidewalks, streets or alleys by curbing or other protective device
approved by the Building Inspector.
(4) Private walks adjacent to business buildings. A walkway, if
provided, adjacent to a business building shall not be less than four
feet in width and shall be in addition to the other requirements of
this section.
(5) Site plan. Location and dimensions of pedestrian entrances, exits,
walks and walkways shall be indicated on submitted site plans.
(6) Connection to a public right-of-way. Each off-street parking, loading
or service area shall be connected to a public street right-of-way by
means of a driveway constructed in accordance with at least the
minimum standards required by this chapter.
(7) Size of driveways. A driveway exclusive of curb return radii shall be
not less than 10 feet in width in all residential zones and not less
than 15 feet in all other zones. A curb return radius for a driveway
at its entrance to a public street shall not exceed 15 feet unless
required. The maximum width of a driveway, exclusive of curb
return radii, shall not exceed 30 feet, except for unusual
circumstances.
(8) Location of curb cuts. At the intersection of streets, a curb cut shall
be not less than 25 feet from the intersection of two curblines in all
zones, except the I-L and I-H Zones, where they shall be 50 feet
from the intersection. Between the curb cuts for any two driveways
serving the same property, there shall be at least 50 feet. Curb cuts
shall be located at least two feet from abutting property lines in all
B-1 and B-4 and the B-5 Zones and all residential zones. Curb cuts
shall be located at least 10 feet from abutting property lines in all
B-2 and B-3 Zones and all industrial zones.
(9) Off-street parking space within buildings. Garage space or space
within buildings, in basements or on the roofs of buildings may be
used to meet the off-street parking requirements of this chapter,
provided that all requirements regarding this section are met.
(10) Pavement markings and signs. Each off-street parking space shall
be clearly marked, and pavement directional arrows or signs shall
be provided wherever necessary. Markers, directional arrows and
signs shall be properly maintained so as to ensure their maximum
efficiency.
§ 349-5 RAHWAY CODE § 349-5
419:912
(11) Lighting for night use. All parking areas, walkways thereto and
appurtenant passageways and driveways serving commercial,
public, office, industrial, or other similar uses having off-street
parking and loading areas, and building complexes requiring area
lighting shall be illuminated adequately during the hours between
sunset and one hour after business hours. The lighting plan in and
around the parking areas shall provide for nonglare, colorcorrected
lights, focused downward. The light intensity provided at
ground level shall be a minimum of 0.3 footcandle anywhere in the
area to be illuminated, shall average a minimum of 0.5 footcandle
over the entire area and shall be provided by fixtures with a
mounting height not to be more than 20 feet measured from the
ground level to the center line of the light source or the height of
the building, if attached, whichever is lower, and spacing not to
exceed five times the mounting height. Any other outdoor lighting,
such as building and sidewalk illumination, driveways with no
adjacent parking and ornamental light, shall be shown on the
lighting plan in sufficient detail to allow determination of the
effects to adjacent properties, traffic safety and overhead sky glow.
The objective of these specifications is to minimize undesirable offpremises
effects. No light shall shine directly into windows or onto
streets and driveways in such manner as to interfere with or
distract driver vision. To achieve these requirements, the intensity
of such light sources, light shielding and similar characteristics
shall be subject to site plan approval by the Planning Board.
(12) Required off-street parking area shall not be reduced. No off-street
parking area shall be reduced in size or encroached upon by
building, vehicle storage, loading or unloading or any other use
where such reduction or encroachment will reduce the off-street
parking and loading spaces that are required by these regulations.
(13) Joint parking facilities. The off-street parking requirements for two
or more neighboring uses may be satisfied by the allocation of the
required number of spaces for each use in a common parking
facility, provided that the number of off-street parking spaces is not
less than the sum of individual requirements; provided, further,
that there be compliance with all other provisions of these
regulations.
(14) Parking provided on same lot as the main building. Off-street
parking spaces for all uses shall be located on the same lot as the
main building to be served.
(15) Sharing of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for one use
shall not be considered as providing the required facilities for any
other use, except that 1/2 of the off-street parking space required
by any use whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays,
such as churches, theaters and assembly halls, may be assigned to
a use which will be closed at night or on Sundays. This provision
will only apply with approval of the Planning Board.
§ 349-5 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 349-5
419:913
(16) Computing number of employees. For the purpose of this section,
the number of employees shall be computed on the basis of the
maximum number of persons to be employed on any one shift,
taking into consideration day, night and seasonal variations.
(17) Fractional spaces required. When units of measurements
determining the number of required off-street parking and offstreet
loading spaces result in the requirement of a fractional
space, any fraction up to and including 1/2 shall be disregarded.
Any units over 1/2 will require an additional space.
(18)Off-street parking and loading space within a required front
setback. In any business zone, parking shall be permitted in the
front yard, provided that a five-foot landscaped area is provided
along the front and side lot lines. Within that area, low shrubs,
fences or any combination of screening material shall be utilized to
buffer those areas from public view. No parking shall be permitted
in the required front yard in any residential zone; however, the
width of the driveway shall not exceed the following schedule:
Lot Width
(feet)
Maximum Width
(feet)
Up to 49 10
50 and over 20
(19) Paving location restrictions. Paving for parking, loading or access
thereto, unless otherwise restricted, except for entrance or exit
drives crossing perpendicular to property lines, shall not be
permitted within five feet of any property line, except in the B-4 and
B-5 Zones.
(20) Parking area site layout. Parking areas shall be divided into lots
separated by appropriate landscaping where possible. In addition,
driveways and internal roads shall be separated from parking areas
by curbed landscaped islands where possible. Landscaping for
parking areas shall be subject to approval as part of submitted site
development plans.
(21) Visitor off-street parking facilities. Visitor parking in industrial
zones may be located in the front yard area, subject to the approval
of the site plan by the Planning Board. No employee parking shall
be allowed in the front yard.
(22) Shared access. Nothing in this chapter is intended to prohibit the
sharing of access by adjacent uses, provided that the common
facility is a service drive.
B. Minimum off-street parking spaces.

A. Purpose. The intention of these requirements is to enhance the
aesthetic and environmental appeal and character of buildings and
sites being developed within the City by ensuring the compatibility of
uses, thereby maintaining the health, safety and general welfare of the
community, while preserving property values.
B. General regulations for all zones.
(1) Landscape area. All areas in a development not used for
construction of buildings, roads, accessways, parking or sidewalks
shall be fully landscaped in accordance with these regulations.
(2) Site considerations. Natural site features, such as existing trees,
streams, rock outcroppings, etc., shall be preserved wherever
possible. Whenever such natural features are absent or insufficient
or have been destroyed during the development of the site,
additional new plantings shall be established to provide
environmental protection to beautify the buildings and grounds and
to provide privacy, shade and the screening out of objectionable
features created on the site.
(3) All landscaped areas shall be covered with a minimum of four
inches of topsoil prior to sowing of seed or sod or planting of trees
or shrubs. Topsoil shall consist of natural fertile agricultural soil of
good texture, free from subsoil, and it shall be taken from an area
which has never been stripped. Topsoil shall be of uniform quality,
free from roots, sods, rubbish, Japanese beetle and other
dangerous insect larvae and shall have come from arable areas
with good normal drainage.
C. Additional regulations for business, industrial and multifamily zones.
(1) A minimum landscaped area five feet wide shall be provided along
all property lines, including public streets, except in the B-4
Service Business and B-5 Central Business Zones.
(2) All buffers and landscaped areas shall be protected from adjacent
parking areas by curbs or concrete, metal or wood bumpers at least
six inches in height and securely anchored into the ground.
(3) Service areas, parking areas, transformer compounds and other
strictly utilitarian improvements shall be screened as fully as
practicable. In general, it is intended that possible objectionable or
§ 349-6 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 349-7
419:919
unsightly features within a given development shall be screened
from passing traffic or abutting residential properties.
(4) In the case of a repetition of building designs, as in apartment
house developments, care shall be exercised to avoid monotony in
the planting design by introducing sufficient variety in the planting
layout to lend interest and aesthetic appeal. By the same token,
excessive variety shall be avoided, and all shall be represented as a
balanced design with the proper accent in the appropriate places.
(5) Provision of trees and shrubs. The following quantities of trees and
shrubs shall be provided in required buffer areas:
(a) Trees.
[1] In all residential, commercial and industrial developments,
a minimum of 15 trees shall be provided for each acre of
development, excluding required buffer areas. No fewer
than 30% of the trees shall be evergreen, and no fewer
than 30% of the trees shall be deciduous. Evergreen trees
shall be a minimum height of six feet at planting.
Deciduous trees shall have minimum heights of 15 feet at
planting and a mature height of at least 30 feet. They shall
be a minimum caliper of 2 1/2 inches measured at a height
of one foot above the base of the tree at planting, except
that a minimum of two deciduous trees per acre shall be
not less than six inches' caliper measured one foot above
the base of the tree. Existing trees that meet the above
conditions may be counted towards providing the
requirements. The number of trees provided shall be
prorated for fractions of an acre, except that not less than
one six-inch-caliper deciduous tree shall be provided.
[2] Deciduous trees that do not have mature heights of 30 feet
or greater may be provided but shall not be counted
towards meeting the above minimum requirement.
(b) Shrubs. For residential developments, a minimum of one shrub
shall be provided for each 50 square feet or fraction thereof of
building coverage. A minimum of 50% of all shrubs shall be
evergreen. For this purpose, at least 50% of all shrubs shall
have a mature height of not less than 30 inches, and no shrub
shall have a mature height of less than 18 inches. All shrubs
shall be in canvas or balled and burlapped and shall have a
minimum height or breadth of 18 inches. Ground covers and
plants with mature heights of less than 18 inches are permitted
but shall not be counted towards meeting the above minimum
requirement.
(6) Buffer planting requirements. Planting in all required buffer areas
shall consist of a minimum of two staggered rows of evergreen
trees spaced 10 feet apart and planted 10 feet on center. Additional
§ 349-7 RAHWAY CODE § 349-7
419:920
§ 349-8. Fences and hedges.
planting materials and/or fencing may be used to supplement the
two rows of evergreen trees but shall not replace them. The
requirement for two rows of evergreen trees may be modified by
the municipal agency if substantial existing vegetation is located
within the buffer area and the strict enforcement of this section
would result in the loss of or damage to the existing vegetation or
would be impractical, as determined by the agency.
(7) Areas required for buffers shall not be cleared or graded prior to
site plan approval.
(8) Retaining walls shall not be permitted within buffer areas unless
approved as part of site plan approval.
(9) In all zones where a multifamily, commercial or industrial
development zone line abuts a single-family residential zone, a
twenty-foot buffer must be established and maintained.
(10) In all zones where a multifamily development zone line abuts an
existing business, commercial or industrial zone, a twenty-foot
buffer must be established and maintained by the multifamily
developer unless such a buffer is already established along the
neighboring boundary of that zone.
(11) In all zones where a business or industrial development line abuts a
multifamily residential zone, a twenty-foot buffer must be
established and maintained unless such a buffer is already
established and maintained along the neighboring boundary of that
zone.
(12)Off-street parking or loading shall not be permitted in any buffer
area.
D. Landscaped area required.
(1) In calculating landscaped areas, the areas of plazas, open or
enclosed pedestrian shopping malls, sitting areas, pools and
fountains shall be included. Landscaped areas within and between
parking areas shall also be included.
(2) In all zones except the B-4 and B-5 Zones, a minimum of 15% of the
site shall be devoted to landscaped areas in addition to all required
buffers.
A. Purpose. The intention of these requirements is to provide standards
for the protection of the health, safety and aesthetic values of adjacent
property.
B. Permit required. A fence three feet or higher shall require a building
permit.
§ 349-7 YARD WASTE COLLECTION § 349-8
419:921
C. Specific requirements.
(1) Intersections. At the intersection of two or more streets, no wall,
fence, hedge or other structure shall be erected to a height in
excess of 2 1/2 feet above curb level, nor shall any other
obstruction to vision shall be permitted, within the triangular area
formed by the intersecting street lines at points which are 25 feet
distant from the point of intersection, measured along said street
line. Trees whose branches are trimmed away to a height of at least
10 feet above curb level shall be permitted.
(2) Height. Subject only to the exceptions set forth in Subsection C(9),
hereof, on any lot in any residential district, no wall or fence shall
be erected or altered so that said wall or fence shall be over four
feet in height in the front yard nor over six feet in any other yard.
Chain-link fences, which must be vinyl-coated, are allowed only in
the rear yard. Fences in the front yard must be picket or split-rail
fencing only with a minimum of 50% open area. [Amended
4-11-2005 by Ord. No. O-10-05; 11-20-2017 by Ord. No.
O-31-17; 7-9-2018 by Ord. No. O-11-18]
(3) Metal spikes, barbed wire or dangerous fences. No fence in a
residential zone shall be erected of barbed wire or topped with
metal spikes or constructed of any material or in any manner which
may be dangerous to persons or animals.
(4) Type. Solid architectural fences shall be required along all lot lines
except the street line for all nonresidential lots where said property
lines abut residential zoning district lines, except that in the B-5
Zone solid masonry walls and similar solid fences shall not be
permitted in the rear yard in order to provide ready access for
emergency apparatus. A wooden solid fence or similar fence easily
entered by emergency apparatus shall be permitted. Such
architectural fences may be made of any material which is
aesthetically pleasing and prevents the dissemination of odors,
noise, debris and sight across the residential zoning boundary.
Fences used for this purpose shall be not less than six feet in
height. Nothing in this section prevents the use of plant materials
along any lot line in addition to the fence requirement, but plant
materials cannot be substituted for the fence. A wall or fence which
restricts the natural flow of drainage or causes stagnant water
conditions shall not be permitted. Said wall or fence shall be
ordered removed or corrected by the owner upon direction of the
Building Inspector. [Amended 7-9-2018 by Ord. No. O-11-18]
(5) Maintenance. In any district, walls or fences erected shall be
maintained in an aesthetically pleasing manner, and any failure to
do so shall be subject to the Building Inspector's order to repair or
replace the wall or fence in order to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
§ 349-8 RAHWAY CODE § 349-8
419:922
(6) The finished side of all fences shall be on the outside facing away
from the lot on which it is erected. The intent of this provision is for
safety purposes to prevent easy access from neighboring property.
(7) Solid masonry or similar fences shall not be permitted in the rear
yard of any B-5 Zone. Solid wooden or similar fences easily entered
by emergency apparatus shall be permitted.
(8) Swimming pools. A continuous, permanent fence at least four feet
in height shall be provided around all swimming pools and contain
locked gates, where gates are provided.
(9) On corner lots located in any Single-Family Residential Zone, a sixfoot,
solid architectural fence may be erected along the secondary
"front yard" where the sight triangle for vehicular and/or
pedestrian traffic is not obstructed and as may be approved by the
Zoning Officer. [Added 11-20-2017 by Ord. No. O-31-17]

D. Historic Preservation Commission review required.
(1) No person shall hereafter engage or cause other persons to engage
in any regulated activity on an historic structure or within an
historic streetscape or district as defined herein unless and until
such person shall have applied for and received a development
permit from the Zoning Officer.
(2) At the discretion of the Zoning Officer, all applications for issuance
of permits pertaining to regulated activities on an historic
landmark or within an historic district as set forth in § 421-28C may
be referred to the Historic Preservation Commission for a written
report on the application of the Zoning Ordinance provisions
concerning historic preservation to any of those aspects of the
§ 421-28 RAHWAY CODE § 421-28
369:1000
change proposed which aspects were not determined by approval
of an application for development by a municipal agency pursuant
to the Municipal Land Use Law, P.L. 1975, c. 291. The Historic
Preservation Commission shall submit its written report to the
Zoning Officer and shall send a copy of the report to the applicant
within 45 days of its referral to the Commission. If within the fortyfive-
day period the Historic Preservation Commission recommends
against the issuance of a permit or recommends conditions to
the permit to be issued, the Zoning Officer may deny issuance of
the permit or include the conditions in the permit of the Historic
Preservation Commission. Failure to report within the forty-fiveday
period shall be deemed to constitute a recommendation in
favor of issuance of the permit and without the recommendation of
conditions to the permit.
(3) Applications for development which are in an historic streetscape
or district or on an historic structure designated pursuant to
§ 421-7 and require approval by the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment may at the discretion of the Zoning Officer be referred
directly to the appropriate Board. The Board shall forward a copy of
the complete application to the Historic Preservation Commission
at least 14 days prior to the hearing. Failure to forward the copy
shall not invalidate any hearing or proceeding. The Historic
Preservation Commission may provide its advice, which shall be
conveyed through its delegation of one of its members or staff to
testify orally at the hearing on the application and to explain any
written report which may have been submitted.
(4) Historic Preservation Commission review shall not be required
when an historic landmark requires immediate emergency repair
to preserve the continued habitability of the landmark and/or the
health and safety of its occupants or others. Emergency repairs
may be performed in accordance with city codes, without the
necessity of first obtaining the Commission's review. Under such
circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such as are
necessary to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the
historic landmark, or others, and/or to maintain the habitability of
the structure. At the Zoning Officer's discretion, a request for the
Commission's review may be made as soon as possible thereafter,
and under such circumstances no further work shall be performed
upon the structure until an appropriate request for approval is
made and obtained in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this chapter. All work done under this section shall conform to the
criteria set forth in § 421-50.
(5) In its review of applications for demolition of an historic landmark
or an improvement in an historic district pursuant to § 421-29D(2)
and (3), the Historic Preservation Commission may recommend,
and the Zoning Officer may require, the postponement of
demolition for a period not to exceed one year. The Commission
§ 421-28 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 421-28
369:1001
shall utilize this time period to consult with the City Council, the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection or other
similarly qualified organizations to ascertain how the city may
preserve the premises to be demolished. The Commission shall be
empowered to assist the owner in developing plans to preserve
the structure when moving or demolition thereof would be a great
loss to the city. The city shall be empowered to negotiate with the
applicant to see if an alternative to demolition can be found and
may require the applicant to prepare financial analysis, which may
include any or all of the following:
(a) Amount paid for the property, date of purchase, and party from
whom purchased, including a description of the relationship,
whether business or familial, if any, between the owner and the
person from whom the property was purchased;
(b) Assessed value of the land and improvements thereon
according to the most recent assessment;
(c) For depreciable properties, a pro forma financial statement
prepared by an accountant or broker of record;
(d) All appraisals obtained by the owner in connection with his
purchase or financing of the property, or during his ownership
of the property;
(e) Bona fide offers of the property for sale or rent price asked,
and offers received, if any;
(f) Any considerations by the owner as to profitable, adaptive uses
for the property.
(6) The Commission shall study the question of economic hardship for
the applicant and shall determine whether the site or the property
in the historic district can be put to reasonable beneficial use
without the approval of the demolition application. In the case of an
income-producing building, the Commission shall also determine
whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his
existing building. The Commission may ask applicants for
additional information to be used in making these determinations.
All final decisions shall be made by the Zoning Officer acting on the
recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission.
E. Certificate of appropriateness.
(1) Where an application for development is referred by the Zoning
Officer to the Historic Preservation Commission for review
pursuant to § 421-28D(2), the applicant shall be required to submit
an application for certificate of appropriateness to the Zoning
Officer. As part of this application, the Historic Preservation
Commission may require the submission of such materials as are
reasonably required for it to make a recommendation on the
§ 421-28 RAHWAY CODE § 421-28
369:1002
§ 421-29. FPO Flood Prevention Overlay Zone.108
application. This application shall accompany the application for
development when it is referred to the Historic Preservation
Commission for review and must be complete in order to be
considered. The Historic Preservation Commission shall advise the
applicant in writing of the time, date, and place of the meeting at
which the matter will be reviewed at least three days prior to the
meeting.
(2) The Historic Preservation Commission may advise other interested
parties of the meeting and may publish notices of the meeting in
the newspaper. The applicant shall not be required to appear or to
be represented at the meeting. The applicant may appear at the
meeting and may submit additional information if he so chooses.
F. Time limit and effect of certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of
appropriateness, which shall only be granted by the Zoning Officer
upon a recommendation by the Historic Preservation Commission, shall
confer upon the applicant the right that the general terms and
conditions upon which the certificate was granted shall not be changed
for one year. Any certificate hereafter granted shall expire by limitation
unless the approved activity has commenced within one year of the date
of the certificate. The Zoning Officer, acting on the advice of the
Historic Preservation Commission, may extend the time period. Where
other approvals or permits are required pursuant to this chapter, the
certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for the life of those
approvals or permits or extensions thereof.
A. Purpose and legislative intent. It is hereby found that the Rahway River
and its tributaries, the North Branch, the South Branch and Robinson's
Branch, and their tributaries within the City of Rahway are subject to
recurrent flooding and that such flooding endangers life and damages
public and private property and facilities and that this condition is
aggravated by developments and encroachments in the floodplain. It is
determined, therefore, that the special and paramount public interest
in the floodplain justifies the regulation of property located therein, as
provided in this section, which is in the exercise of the police power of
the municipality for the protection of persons and property of its
inhabitants and for the preservation of public health, safety and general
welfare.
B. Floodplain Prevention Overlay Zone boundaries. The boundaries of the
Floodplain Prevention Overlay Zone boundaries shall coincide with and
include all land within the City of Rahway within an area of special flood
hazard as defined in § 213-3 of Chapter 213, Flood Damage Prevention,
and is delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (enter title, latest
revision date), which is on file at the office of the City Engineer of the
City of Rahway.

C. Applicability. All developments or development applications which are
located within the areas of special flood hazard as defined in § 213-3 of
Chapter 213, Flood Damage Prevention, shall be subject to the
provisions of Chapter 213, Flood Damage Prevention, in addition to the
requirements or provisions of the underlying zone. Whichever
regulation shall impose the more stringent restriction, that regulation
shall prevail and take precedence.

369:1041
§ 421-50. Regulations applying to all structures in HPO Historic
Preservation Overlay Zone.
(4) Dirty, rotten, broken, rusted or otherwise damaged condition.
A. In carrying out all its duties and responsibilities, including but not
limited to the nomination of structures, streetscapes and districts for
historic designation pursuant to Article VIII of the Land Procedures
Ordinance and the review of regulated activities pursuant to § 421-28,
the Historic Preservation Commission shall be guided by the following:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary,
the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be
based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural
designs or the availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
§ 421-49 RAHWAY CODE § 421-50
369:1042
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size,
scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood
or environment.
(10) Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
B. On an historic structure or within an historic district designated
pursuant to § 421-7 and regulated pursuant to § 421-28, visual
compatibility factors shall be considered by the Historic Preservation
Commission in its review. It is the intent of this chapter to preserve the
integrity and authenticity of historic landmarks and districts and to
insure the compatibility of new structures. If past architectural styles
are to be used, a copy of a specific structure is preferable to an
amalgam of building types and styles. In regard to an application for
any regulated activity pursuant to § 421-28, the following visual
compatibility factors shall be considered:
(1) Height. The height of the proposed building shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(2) Proportion of building's front facade. The relationship of the width
of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of the
width of windows to the height of windows in a building shall be
visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of solids
to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of the
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings shall
be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. The relationship of
entrance and porch projections to the street shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(7) Relationship of materials, texture and color. The relationship of
materials, texture and color of the facade and roof of a building
§ 421-50 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 421-50
369:1043
shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in
the buildings to which it is visually related.
(8) Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building shall be visually
compatible with buildings to which it is visually related.
(9) Walls of continuity. Appurtenances of a building such as walls,
open-type fencing and evergreen landscape masses shall form
cohesive walls of enclosure along a street, to the extent necessary
to maintain visual compatibility with the buildings and places to
which it is visually related.
(10) Scale of building. The size of a building, the mass of a building in
relation to open spaces, the windows, door openings, porches and
balconies shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places
to which it is visually related.
(11) Directional expression of front elevation. A building shall be
visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually
related in its directional character, whether this be vertical
character, horizontal character or nondirectional character.
(12) Exterior features. A structure's related exterior features such as
lighting, fences, signs, sidewalks, driveways, and parking areas
shall be compatible with the features of those structures to which it
is visually related and shall be appropriate for the historic period
for which the structure is significant.
C. In preparing a recommendation regarding a regulated activity pursuant
to § 421-28D, the Historic Preservation Commission shall consider
whether the proposed activity is reasonable and appropriate and is not
in conflict with the intent and purpose of the provisions related to
historic sites and districts as exemplified by the following standards and
regulations:
(1) Regulated activities other than demolitions and removals. In regard
to an application involving any regulated activity other than
demolition or removal, the following matters shall be considered:
(a) The extent to which the proposed use of any building or
structure involved may have a negative impact on the
continued viability of the historic landmark or district.
(b) The extent to which the proposed activity will adversely affect
the public's view of an historic structure or a structure within
an historic district.
(c) If an historic structure is involved:
[1] The extent to which the proposed change will detract from
the architectural or historic character of the historic
landmark or from the criteria which were the basis of the
designation of the historic structure.
§ 421-50 RAHWAY CODE § 421-50
369:1044
[2] The extent to which the proposed change will result in the
loss of old, unusual, or uncommon design, craftsmanship,
textures or materials that cannot be reproduced or can be
reproduced only with great difficulty.
[3] The landmark's importance to the city and the extent to
which its historic or architectural interest would be
adversely affected to the detriment of the public interest
by the proposed activity.
(d) If within an historic streetscape or district:
[1] The extent to which the proposed change will detract from
the character or ambience of the historic streetscape or
district or from the criteria which were the basis of the
designation of the historic streetscape or district.
[2] The extent to which the proposed change is visually
compatible with the buildings, places and structures to
which it would be visually related in terms of the visual
compatibility factors set forth in this section.
(2) Demolitions. In regard to an application to demolish an historic
landmark, or any improvement within an historic district, the
following matters shall be considered:
(a) Its historic, architectural, cultural or scenic significance in
relation to the criteria established in § 421-28.
(b) If it is within an historic streetscape or district, its significance
to the district as a key contributing or noncontributing
structure and the probable impact of its removal on the
character and ambience of the district and the criteria which
were the basis of the designation of the district.
(c) Its potential for use for those purposes currently permitted by
this chapter.
(d) Its structural condition and the economic feasibility of
alternatives to the proposal.
(e) Its importance to the municipality and the extent to which its
historical or architectural value is such that its removal would
be detrimental to the public interest.
(f) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon
design, craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be
reproduced or could be reproduced only with great difficulty
and expense.
(g) The extent to which its retention would promote the general
welfare by maintaining and increasing the real estate values,
generating business, attracting tourists, attracting new

O-17-16]
residents, stimulating interest and study in architecture and
design, or making the municipality an attractive and desirable
place in which to live.
(3) In regard to an application to move an historic structure or any
building or structure in an historic streetscape or district to a new
location, the following matters shall be considered:
(a) The historic loss to the site of original location and, if the
present location is within an historic district, to the historic
streetscape or district as a whole.
(b) The reasons for not retaining the historic structure at its
present site.
(c) The compatibility, nature and character of the current and of
the proposed surrounding areas as they relate to the
protection of interest and values referred to in this chapter.
(d) If the proposed new location is within a district, visual
compatibility factors as set forth in this section.
(e) The probability of significant damage to the landmark or
structure itself.
(f) If it is to be removed from the City of Rahway, the proximity of
the proposed new location to the city, including the
accessibility to the residents of the city and other citizens.
A. Permitted uses.
(1) General. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted
uses and shall not require administrative approval or a conditional
use permit.
(2) Permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted:
(a) Antennas, towers, or alternate tower structures located on
publicly owned property, provided an agreement authorizing
such antenna or tower has been entered into with the public
owner of the property.
B. General requirements.
(1) Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an
existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation
of an antenna or tower on such lot.
(2) Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with district development regulations,
§ 421-50 RAHWAY CODE § 421-50.1
369:1046
including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the
entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be
located on leased parcels within such lot.
(3) Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the City Zoning Officer an inventory of its
existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or
antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the City of
Rahway or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific
information about the location, height, and design of each tower.
The City Zoning Officer may share such information with other
applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use
permits under this section or other organizations seeking to locate
antennas within the jurisdiction of the City of Rahway, provided,
however, that the City Zoning Officer is not, by sharing such
information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites
are available or suitable.
(4) Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
(a) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the Federal Aviation
Association ("FAA"), be painted a neutral color so as to reduce
visual obtrusiveness.
(b) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend towers
and related structures into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
(c) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment
must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely
compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to
make the antenna and related equipment as visually
unobtrusive as possible.
(5) Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the
lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least
disturbance to the surrounding views.
(6) State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the Federal
Communications Commission and any other agency of the state or
federal government with the authority to regulate towers and
antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall
bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
§ 421-50.1 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 421-50.1
369:1047
standards and regulations within six months of the effective date
of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance
schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency.
Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such
revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the
removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
(7) Building codes: safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended
from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City of Rahway concludes
that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being
provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to
bring such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to
bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense.
(8) Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities
located in the City of Rahway irrespective of municipal and county
jurisdictional boundaries.
(9) Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this section and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
(10) Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/

C. Front yards to face dedicated public street. All front yards must face on
a dedicated public street or on a private street approved by the
Planning Board or City Council, for at least 50 feet along the street line,
except in the case of culs-de-sac, in which case the lot must face on said
street for at least 40 feet. No building or use will be permitted on a lot
unless that lot has frontage on a street that has been improved in

front yard setback required must be consistent with the front yard
setback for the immediately adjoining properties. Should the prevailing
front yard setback for one or both of the immediately adjoining
properties not be consistent, then the prevailing front yard setback
required must be consistent with the prevailing front yard setback of a
majority of the lots on the block front along which the property is
located. [Added 8-10-1998 by Ord. No. O-39-98; amended

however, shall be erected only to such height as is necessary to
accomplish the purposes they are to serve. The provisions of this
chapter shall not apply to prevent the erection above the building
height of a parapet wall or cornice for ornamental purposes to
screen mechanical appurtenances.

or any lot of official record at the time of enactment of this chapter,
provided that the owner of such lot does not now own any adjoining
lot or adjacent land and has not sold any adjacent land after
enactment of this chapter to create a nonconforming lot. Where an
existing nonconforming or conforming building and/or use is
situated or is to be situated on an undersized lot of record,
improvements or additions may be made without variance
approval, provided that the improvement or addition does not
encroach on any front, rear or side yard setback requirements and
meets all other provisions of this chapter. Where the owner of a lot
of substandard size owns adjacent lots or parcels of land, such lots
or parcels shall be considered as a single lot, and area and yard
space provisions of this chapter shall hold.

requirements of this section shall apply and govern in all zones within
the City of Rahway, except as stipulated in §§ 421-22 and 421-44.
Except as provided in this section, no application for a building permit
shall be approved unless there is included with the plan for such
building, improvement or use a plot plan showing the required space
reserved for off-street parking, unloading and service purposes. A
certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless the required offstreet
parking, unloading and service facilities have been provided in
accordance with those shown on the approved plan.
B. Off-street loading. On the same premises with every building, structure
or part thereof erected and occupied for commercial, industrial,
institutional or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution
of vehicles, materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and
maintained on the lot adequate space for off-street standing, turning,
loading and unloading services in order to avoid interference with the

occupied, and no use shall be operated, unless off-street parking and
loading facilities are provided in at least the amount and maintained in
the manner required by this section.

use, except that 1/2 of the off-street parking space required by any use
whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays, such as places of
worship, theaters and assembly halls, may be assigned to a use which
will be closed at night or on Sundays. This provision will only apply with
approval of the Planning Board.

additional square footage is approved to replace square footage in
existing structures containing lawfully established uses, off-street
parking and loading facilities shall be required only to the extent that
the existing square footage is enlarged. However, no existing off-street
parking and loading spaces or the access thereto provided at the time of
the passage of this chapter in conjunction with such a conforming use

District may, at the discretion of the Planning Board and in conjunction
with a site plan and/or subdivision application, be granted relief from
the off-street parking requirements, provided credible evidence is
presented that the parking needs of such uses can be met by existing
on-street spaces and off-street public or private parking lots. The
Planning Board may require the furnishing of written authorization of
the owners of such off-street parking lots that the specified number of
parking spaces in such a lot are available and will be designated for
daily or overnight parking for the residents of such a use.

Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 421-78. Purpose.
Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures
which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended but which
would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter
or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed. Such uses are declared
by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts
involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that, except for singleand
two-family residences, nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended nor be used as grounds for adding other structures
or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district, unless to make such use
or structure conform to the minimum requirements of this chapter.
§ 421-79. Nonconforming structures and uses.
A. Any legally established nonconforming use or nonconforming structure
existing at the time of the passage of this chapter may be continued
upon the lot or in the structure so occupied. Such structure may be
restored or repaired in the event of partial destruction thereof, but only
to the extent of the previous nonconformity. Any nonconforming use or
structure damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than
50% of its assessed valuation requires a use variance from the Board of
Adjustment to be rebuilt. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any wall, roof or floor
which has been declared unsafe by the Construction Code Official.
[Amended 4-11-2005 by Ord. No. O-11-05]
B. No nonconforming use of a structure shall be extended to occupy land
outside existing structures.
C. Change from one nonconforming use to another shall not be allowed,
except by approval of the Board of Adjustment. Any nonconforming
single- or two-family residential building existing at the time of the
passage of this chapter may make alterations or additions to the
structure to the extent that an addition may be erected to the portion of
the building which does not conform, provided that it will not extend
beyond the existing setback of such portion. Lots that are
nonconforming because of area may be built upon without applying to
the municipal agency, provided that any construction shall meet all
provisions of the zone, except minimum area. For this purpose,
contiguous lots under one ownership shall be considered a lot in its
entirety. No nonconforming use shall be permitted to expand without
applying to the Board of Adjustment for a variance.
§ 421-78 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 421-80
369:1073
§ 421-80. Repairs and maintenance.
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use,
repairs and maintenance may be made. Said repairs shall be limited to
routine or ordinary repairs. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any wall, floor or roof which
has been declared unsafe by the Building Official.
§ 421-81. Signs.
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or
enlarged after passage of this chapter, by attachment on a building or
premises or addition, signs intended to be seen from off the premises or by
the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally
in the district involved.
§ 421-82. Nonapplicability for structures previously begun.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require
a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on
which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. "Actual construction" is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner according to architectural
and engineering design, except that where demolition or removal of an
existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction,
provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the
building involved.

All poles, posts, pedestals, cabinets, or other facilities shall be located and
placed back of the curblines where shown on the Official Map(s) of the city;

out of road conditions resulting from any negligent or faulty excavations,
installation or maintenance connected with the work or equipment of said
company, and not attribute to the fault or negligence of the city, except

negligence or fault of the company and the city, the same shall be borne by
them to the extent of their respective fault or negligence.
§ A431-6. Establishment or relocation of curblines.
Whenever a curbline shall be established on streets where one does not now

maintained, repaired, or operated by the company, its predecessors,
successors, or assigns within the city. This ordinance shall cancel and
supersede all prior consent ordinances between the city and the company
regarding the subject matter hereof.

unenforceable under applicable law, such illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provisions of this ordinance, and this ordinance shall
§ A431-8 COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES § A431-13
A431:1089
be construed as if such illegal or unenforceable provision(s) had never been
