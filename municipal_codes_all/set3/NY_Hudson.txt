Research and Reapportionment with respect to persons resident in
state or federal prisons. Such census block data is set forth below
listing the census blocks in each ward that contain population. The
asterisked population figures for census block Tract 1300, Block 1002,
with a total population of 365, that is split between Wards 1 and 2, are
based on there being 168 housing units in said census block, of which
60 units are within the boundaries of Ward 1, and 108 units are within
the boundaries of Ward 2, as calculated by the City Clerk of Hudson.
The asterisked population figures for census block Tract 1200, Block
1012, with a total population of 200, that is split between Wards 4 and
5, are based on there being 91 housing units in said census block, of
which 34 units are within the boundaries of Ward 4, and 57 units are
within the boundaries of Ward 5, as calculated by the City Clerk of
Hudson.

Common Council in Relation to Public Improvements
§ C13-1. Alteration of streets; notice thereof.
Whenever the Common Council shall, by vote, at a regular meeting of 2/3
of all the members of said Council voting therefor, decide to lay out, open,
make, alter, widen, contract or discontinue any square, street, alley, lane or
highway, it shall cause a notice of such decision to be published daily for
two successive weeks in the official newspaper, stating the day upon which
it will act thereupon, which day shall be at least two weeks subsequent to
the first publication of notice.
§ C13-2. Street alterations not involving property appropriations.
In case it shall not be necessary to appropriate, for any purpose
contemplated in the preceding section, any real estate which shall not
belong to the City, or which shall not be given to the City for the purpose,
the Common Council, upon the day fixed in the notice, may proceed to lay
out, alter, widen, contract or discontinue such square, street, alley, lane or
highway mentioned in the notice.
§ C13-3. Notice of proposed taking of private property.
In case it shall be necessary to appropriate, for any street, alley, square,
lane, highway, walk, bridge, drain or sewer, any real estate, property, right
or easement which the City may not be permitted by the owner freely to
appropriate, and cannot purchase by contract with the owner thereof, in
addition to the notice provided for in § C13-1 of this Charter, the Common
Council shall cause a notice to be served upon each of the owners of
such real estate, if they can be ascertained, that the Common Council will
act upon the question of making an appropriation thereof for the purpose
proposed at a time mentioned therein, which shall be at least two weeks
after such service. The notice shall be served personally upon persons
residing in the City, or by leaving the same at their places of abode with
some person of suitable age and discretion. Upon nonresidents it may be
served personally or by mailing it, addressed to them at their reputed places
of abode. In case the owners are unknown, or their places of abode cannot
be ascertained, the publication of the notice, once in each week for two
successive weeks in the official newspaper, shall be equivalent to personal
service.
§ C13-4. Appointment of Commissioners to determine facts;
proceedings.
Upon proof's by affidavit of the service of the notice required by the last
preceding section being filed with the Clerk, the Common Council may
apply to the County Court of Columbia County, in term or at chambers,
or to the Supreme Court, at a special term thereof, held for the Third
Judicial District, for the appointment of Commissioners. Previous to such
§ C13-1 CHARTER § C13-4
C:53
application the Common Council shall cause a notice of the time and place,
when and where such application will be made, to be published in the
official newspaper once in each week for at least two successive weeks,
and, at the time such application shall be made, proof by affidavit shall
be furnished to said Court of the due publication of such notice, and any
party interested shall be entitled to be heard upon such application. At
the time mentioned in such notice, upon the application of the Common
Council, the Court shall appoint three disinterested freeholders of the City
Commissioners, whose duty it shall be to ascertain and report a description
of the real estate required to be appropriated, with the names of the owners
and the compensation which should be made to them respectively therefor;
what the whole expense will amount to; whether any, and, if any, what,
part thereof, ought to be borne by the City, and whether any, and, if any,
what, real estate would be benefited by the improvement requiring the
appropriation of such real estate, specifying the same in parcels, described
with certainty, with the names of the owners, if they can be ascertained,
and the proportion and amount of benefit which each parcel would receive.
The Commissioners aforesaid shall, before entering upon their duties, make
and file with the City Clerk an oath or affirmation faithfully and impartially
to discharge their duties according to the best of their ability. They shall
cause a notice of the time and place of their first meeting to be published
in the official newspaper at least six days before such meeting, and they
shall continue their meetings by adjournment from time to time until they
shall complete their report. They shall view the premises and receive any
evidence that may be offered touching the question before them, and may
administer oaths to witnesses who may be examined before them, and shall
with all convenient dispatch make their report.
§ C13-5. Report of Commissioners; proceedings thereon.
On the coming in of the report, as provided in the last preceding section,
the Common Council shall cause to be published in the official newspaper
a notice that the same is filed with the Clerk, and that at the time specified
therein, which shall be at least six days after the first publication of said
notice, it will act upon the same. Prior to such day, any person objecting
to the matters contained in the report, or to the proposed improvement,
may file with the Clerk his objections in writing, which objections shall
be read before the Common Council before any action shall be had on
said report. The Common Council may confirm or reject said report; and,
if the same shall be rejected, it may, in the manner provided in the last
preceding section, apply to either of said Courts for the appointment of
three other disinterested freeholders as Commissioners as aforesaid, who
shall proceed anew in the premises. Upon the coming in of their report
the same shall be filed with the Clerk in the same manner as the report of
the first Commissioners. The second report shall be final without further
confirmation. The Commissioners shall be paid for their service such
compensation as the Common Council shall deem proper.

real estate and the making of the improvement. In such case it shall cause
an assessment to be made by transcribing so much of the report acted upon
as contained the description of each parcel of real estate to be benefited by
the improvement, with the name of the owner, if known, and the amount of
the proportion of benefit which it would receive, directing such amount to
be assessed upon such parcels of real estate respectively. The assessment
shall be made to resemble in form, as nearly as practicable, the tax list,
and be provided with a column in which payment can be entered by the
Treasurer. Two copies thereof shall be made and signed by the Mayor and
Clerk, one of which shall be filed with the Clerk and the other delivered to

Treasurer shall attend at his office for the purpose of receiving the moneys
due upon said assessment lists, as provided in § C18-7 of this Charter, and
at the expiration of the month mentioned in said section the Treasurer
shall make a return to the Common Council of all sums remaining unpaid
upon said list, and thereafter, whenever directed by the Common Council,

assessment was made. No money belonging to the City shall be paid out
§ C13-6 CHARTER § C13-9
C:55
by the Treasurer upon orders drawn against moneys to be raised upon any
such assessment list.
§ C13-10. Second assessment upon property benefited.
In case the Common Council shall at any time ascertain that the expense
of any public improvement cannot be defrayed by the money raised upon
the assessment list provided therefor, it may cause the deficiency to be
assessed upon the real estate described therein, in sums proportioned to
the former assessment. All the provisions of this article relative to the
assessment list heretofore mentioned, to the assessment therein and to the
collection and payment of the moneys thereon shall be applicable to the
second assessment list in this section provided.
§ C13-11. Refund of excess amount raised.
In case the amount raised for any public improvement by assessment shall
exceed the cost of the same, such excess shall be refunded in proportion to
the amount paid by each person or parcel of real estate.
§ C13-12. Taking prohibited until compensation paid.
No real estate shall be taken or appropriated for the opening, widening
or altering of any street, lane, highway, alley, drain or sewer in the City
without the permission of the owner, until the compensation reported by the
Commissioners to be proper therefor shall be paid or tendered to the owner
or deposited to his or her use in one of the banks of the City to be designated
by the Common Council for that purpose.
§ C13-13. Infant owner; appointment of guardian.
When such owners of real estate shall be known to be infants under the age
of 21 years, the County Judge of Columbia County, or the City Judge of the
City, may, on the application of the infant or someone in behalf of said infant
or of the Common Council, appoint a guardian for such infant, taking from
him adequate security for the faithful performance of his duties as such, and

guardian, who shall see to the protection of the rights of such infant.

in the official newspaper stating the objects for which such expenditure
ought to be made, the amount which it would require to be raised and

have the same powers and perform the same duties and in like manner
as inspectors of election. In case any inspector shall fail to attend such

fill the vacancy. The Common Council may set such hours during which
the polls of such election shall be open as it may deem necessary and
convenient.

inspectors shall tender to him the following oath or affirmation: "You swear
(or affirm) that you are a resident of the City of Hudson, aged 18 years
or upwards, and that you have not voted at this election." If he shall take
the oath and his name shall be found on the current list of electors of the
City, his vote shall be received; if he shall decline to take it, it shall not be
received. All provisions of law for punishing false swearing and fraudulent

and "against special tax," and to the left of each such line there shall be a
voting square in one of which the voter shall make a cross mark or check
mark, which shall indicate his vote. The ballots shall be received by the
inspectors and deposited in a box provided for the purpose, and at the

canvassed at the annual election for City officers, and all provisions of law
applicable to such canvass shall be applicable so far as possible to canvass
for special elections.

The inspectors of the special elections held pursuant to the provisions of
this article shall make and sign a certificate of the number of votes "for
special tax," and "against special tax," and shall file the same with the

present such certificate to the Common Council at its next meeting, and the
same shall be recorded at length in the record of proceedings.

were "for special tax," the Common Council may borrow upon the credit
of the City the amount specified and shall issue bonds or certificates of
indebtedness therefor and shall cause the amount specified to be raised by
tax for the purpose therein set forth, in addition to the moneys otherwise
authorized to be raised by the provisions of this Charter. It may direct the
whole sum required to be raised in addition to and with the next annual tax
for ordinary expenses, or in two or more equal annual installments, with the

nuclear, radiological, chemical, bacteriological or biological means or other
weapons or processes.
DULY AUTHORIZED DEPUTY  A person authorized to perform all the
powers and duties of a public office in the event the office is vacant or at

this chapter for possible temporary succession to the powers and duties, but

§ 62-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "City of Hudson Emergency Alarm Law."
§ 62-2. Legislative determination.
The Common Council of the City of Hudson hereby finds and declares that
there is a growing incidence of false emergency alarms sounded throughout
the City. Such false alarms utilize an increasing amount of valuable time
of City police officers. Often, the City Police Department must respond to
false emergency alarms at the same location on repeated occasions. Such
false soundings hamper law enforcement efforts and pose an increased
risk to citizens when police time is wasted responding to nonemergencies.
The Council therefore finds and declares that it is in the public interest
to establish a statute governing the sale, installation and maintenance of
burglar, fire and other emergency alarms in the City of Hudson.
§ 62-3. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are hereby defined:
EMERGENCY ALARM  Any type of device or system of devices which
provides warning of intrusion, fire, smoke, burglary, flood or like perils
and which transmits emergency signals via telephone lines or otherwise
to police headquarters or sounds an alarm audible outside the building,
structure or property protected by the emergency alarm. Specifically
excluded is a standard household smoke alarm which has as its primary
function giving warning of smoke or fire to the occupants of the building or
structure, or portion thereof, protected by such alarm.
FALSE ALARM  Any signal necessitating response by the Police or Fire
Department where an emergency situation does not exist.
LICENSED INSTALLER  Any person duly licensed to install security or
fire alarm systems pursuant to § 69-m of Article 6-D of the General Business
Law of the State of New York.[Added 3-30-1993 by L.L. No. 2-199334]
PERSISTENT FALSE ALARM  The fourth and each subsequent false alarm
which occurs at one location during any twelve-month period commencing
May 1 and ending the following April 30.

prior registration of the alarm with the Police Department of the City of

this chapter in the City of Hudson shall be registered with the Hudson
Police Department on or before May 1, 1988.
B. Every person required to register an emergency alarm must furnish the
Hudson Police Department at the time of registration, and as necessary
thereafter, a list of current information as follows:
(1) The name, residence address and telephone number of the
registrant.
(2) The name, address and telephone number of any other person at a
different location who is authorized to respond to an emergency
and open the location where the alarm system is installed to reset
the alarm.
(3) In the case of a business location, the registrant shall provide the
Police Department with at least three persons to contact in case of
an emergency who have access to the location.
(4) Name, address and telephone number of the licensed installer who
installed the emergency alarm, and the name, address and
telephone number of the person, if any, with whom the registrant
has contracted for service of the emergency alarm. [Added
3-30-1993 by L.L. No. 2-1993]
C. A one-time registration fee as established by the Common Council shall
be charged by the City of Hudson for residential alarms. An annual
registration fee as established by the Common Council shall be charged
by the City of Hudson for an emergency alarm at a business location, to
be billed by the Hudson Police Department in May of each year.36

registered unless such alarm automatically terminates the audible
signal within 15 minutes of its activation.
E. The registrant of an emergency alarm shall notify the Hudson Police
Department of the removal, disconnection or other act rendering an

BUILDINGS, VACANT
GENERAL REFERENCES
Building permits  See Ch. 97. Unsafe buildings  See Ch. 101.
§ 91-1. Legislative findings and purpose.
It is the finding of the Common Council that buildings which remain vacant,
with access points boarded over, are unsightly, unsafe and have a negative
effect on their surroundings. This is particularly troublesome in residential
and neighborhood commercial neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many
buildings, once boarded, remain that way for many years. The purpose of
this chapter is to establish a program for identifying and registering vacant
buildings; to determine the responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings
and structures; and to speed the rehabilitation of the vacant properties.
Buildings which become vacant due to foreclosure or that are vacant when
foreclosed upon present additional problems. It is often more difficult to
secure compliance with this chapter when the property is owned by a bank
or mortgage company located in another jurisdiction. As the number of
vacant properties increases, the maintenance of vacant buildings becomes
even more critical.
C. All plans and records pertaining to buildings or structures, or
appurtenances thereto, shall be retained for at least the minimum time
period so required by state law and regulation.
A. The Code Enforcement Officer shall annually submit to the Common
Council of the City of Hudson a written report and summary of all
business conducted by the Code Enforcement Officer and the
inspectors, including a report and summary of all transactions and
activities and a report and summary of all appeals or litigation pending
or concluded.
B. The Code Enforcement Officer shall annually submit to the Secretary of
State, on behalf of this City, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of
State, a report of the activities of this City relative to administration and
enforcement of the Uniform Code.
C. The Code Enforcement Officer shall, upon request of the New York
State Department of State, provide to the New York State Department
of State, from the records and related materials this City is required to
maintain, excerpts, summaries, tabulations, statistics and other
information and accounts of the activities of this City in connection with
administration and enforcement of the Uniform Code.

A dilapidated building may also serve as a place of rodent and insect
infestation, thereby creating a health menace to the community. Debris,
rubble or parts of buildings left on the ground and not removed constitute
a dangerous, unhealthy and unsightly condition. It is the purpose of this
chapter to provide for the safety, health, protection and general welfare
of persons and property in the City of Hudson by requiring such unsafe
buildings to be repaired or demolished or removed.

pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 1 of the New York Municipal Law, as
amended by Chapter 497 of the Laws of 2013, which authorizes
municipalities to award purchase and service contracts, subject to
competitive bidding under General Municipal Law § 103, based upon
either the lowest responsible bidder or "best value," as defined in § 163
of the New York State Finance Law. This best value option may, but is
not required to be, used to award an applicable purchase and service
contracts to optimize quality, cost, and efficiency among responsive and
responsible offers instead of the lowest responsible bidder.
B. Basis for award. In accordance with § 103, Subdivision 1 of the New
York General Municipal Law, as amended by Chapter 497 of the Laws of
2013, the City of Hudson may award contracts, including both purchase
contracts and those contracts for service work, that have been procured
pursuant to competitive bidding under General Municipal Law § 103 by
either lowest responsible bidder or best value. Goods and services
procured and awarded on the basis of best value pursuant to General
Municipal Law § 103(16) are those that the City of Hudson determines
will be of the highest quality while being the most cost efficient. The
determination of quality and cost efficiency shall be based on
objectively quantified and clearly described and documented criteria,
which may include, but shall not be limited to, any or all of the
following: cost of maintenance; proximity to the end user if distance or
response time is a significant term; durability; availability of
replacement parts or maintenance contractors; and longer product life,
product performance criteria, and quality of craftsmanship.
C. Applicable contracts. These sections shall apply to all purchase
contracts, both those involving an expenditure of more than $20,000
including contracts for service work (i.e., building services under
Article 9 of the Labor Law and utility services), but excluding any
purchase contract necessary for the completion of a public works
contract pursuant to Article 8 of the State Labor Law, as well as
excluding any other contracts in accordance with future state law. If the

Article 9 of the Labor Law and utility services), but excluding any
purchase contract necessary for the completion of a public works
contract pursuant to Article 8 of the State Labor Law as well as
excluding any other contracts in accordance with future state law. If the
dollar thresholds of General Municipal Law § 103 are increased or
decreased in the future by the State Legislature, the dollar thresholds
set forth herein shall be deemed simultaneously amended to match the
new General Municipal Law thresholds.
D. Documentation. All information gathered in the course of the bidding
procedures of this section shall be filed with the documentation
supporting the subsequent purchase or public works contract. When a

contract is awarded on the basis of best value rather than a lowest
responsible bidder, the basis for determining best value shall be

E. General Municipal Law § 103 purchases. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this section, the City of Hudson may, for purposes of public
purchases, utilize the provisions of General Municipal Law (GML) § 103
with regard to so-called "piggybacking" of purchases. The City of
Hudson may piggyback whenever allowed by law, including but not
limited to, the following situations and criteria:
(1) Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 103, the City of Hudson may
purchase through the bids solicited and bid lists generated by the
United States government and New York State (and its political
subdivisions and school districts) whenever such bids or bid lists
are generated in a manner as complies with said GML § 103. A
quote or proposal received pursuant to standard bidding
procedures let out by the United States or any agency thereof, any
state or any other political subdivision or district therein, may be
awarded on either a best value or lowest responsible bidder
standard;
(2) If not a bid or list generated by a New York State governmental
body or agency, then whenever such contract or bid lists were let in
a manner consistent with or materially equivalent to the
requirements of the State of New York as reflected in the policy and
language of said GML § 103;
(3) The City may also piggyback upon any contract or foreign bid or bid
list specifically approved for piggybacking through the New York
State Office of General Services, as well as foreign bids and bid lists
(mainly, of sister states) that meet the above criteria for
piggybacking as set forth in sections § 112E(1) or E(2) herein.
F. Procurement policy. Any inconsistent provision of the City's
procurement policy, as adopted prior to the effective date of this
chapter by resolution of the Common Council, or as amended
thereafter, shall be deemed superseded by the provisions of this

a preconviction forfeiture crime need not be grounded upon conviction
of a preconviction forfeiture crime; provided, however, that if the action
is not grounded upon such a conviction, it shall be necessary in the
action for the claiming authority to prove the commission of a
preconviction forfeiture crime by clear and convincing evidence. An
action under this subsection shall be stayed during the pendency of a
criminal action which is related to it, provided that such stay shall not
prevent the granting or continuance of any provisional remedy provided
under this chapter or under any other provision of law governing
provisional remedies.
A. In a forfeiture action commenced by a claiming authority against a
criminal defendant, except for those issues required by this chapter to
be proven by clear and convincing evidence, the burden shall be upon
the claiming authority to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the
facts necessary to establish a claim for forfeiture.
B. In a forfeiture action commenced by a claiming authority against a
noncriminal defendant:
(1) In an action relating to a preconviction forfeiture crime, the burden
shall be upon the claiming authority to prove by clear and
convincing evidence the commission of the crime by a person;
provided, however, that it shall not be necessary to prove the
identity of such person.
(2) If the action relates to the proceeds of a crime, except as provided
in Subsection B(1) hereof, the burden shall be upon the claiming
authority to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the facts
necessary to establish a claim for forfeiture and that the
noncriminal defendant either:
(a) Knew or should have known that the proceeds were obtained
through the commission of a crime; or
(b) Fraudulently obtained his or her interest in the proceeds to
avoid forfeiture.
§ 116-8 HUDSON CODE § 116-10
116:234
(3) If the action relates to the substituted proceeds of a crime, except
as provided in Subsection B(1) hereof, the burden shall be upon the
claiming authority to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the
facts necessary to establish a claim for forfeiture and that the
noncriminal defendant either:
(a) Knew that the property sold or exchanged to obtain an interest
in the substituted proceeds was obtained through the
commission of a crime; or
(b) Fraudulently obtained his or her interest in the substituted
proceeds to avoid forfeiture.
(4) If the action relates to an instrumentality of a crime, except as
provided for in Subsection B(1) hereof, the burden shall be upon
the claiming authority to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the facts necessary to establish a claim for forfeiture and that the
noncriminal defendant either:
(a) Knew that the instrumentality was or would be used in the
commission of a crime;
(b) Knowingly obtained his or her interest in the instrumentality to
avoid forfeiture; or
(c) In a forfeiture action commenced by a claiming authority
against a noncriminal defendant, the following rebuttable
presumptions shall apply:
[1] A noncriminal defendant who did not pay fair
consideration for the proceeds of a crime, the substituted
proceeds of a crime or the instrumentality of a crime shall
be presumed to know that such property was the proceeds
of a crime, the substituted proceeds of a crime or an
instrumentality of a crime.
[2] A noncriminal defendant who obtains an interest in the
proceeds of a crime, substituted proceeds of a crime or an
instrumentality of a crime with knowledge of an order of
provisional remedy relating to said property issued
pursuant to this chapter shall be presumed to know that
such property was the proceeds of a crime, substituted
proceeds of a crime or an instrumentality of a crime.
[3] In an action relating to a postconviction forfeiture crime, a
noncriminal defendant who the claiming authority proves
by clear and convincing evidence has criminal liability
under § 20.00 of the Penal Law for the crime or for
criminal activity arising from a common scheme or plan of
which such crime is a part and who possesses an interest
in the proceeds, the substituted proceeds or an
instrumentality of such criminal activity is presumed to
§ 116-10 CRIME PROCEEDS, FORFEITURE OF § 116-10
116:235
know that such property was the proceeds of a crime, the
substituted proceeds of a crime or an instrumentality of a
crime.
[4] A noncriminal defendant who participated in or was aware
of a scheme to conceal or disguise the manner in which
said noncriminal obtained his or her interest in the
proceeds of a crime, substituted proceeds of a crime or an
instrumentality of a crime is presumed to know that such
property was the proceeds of a crime, the substituted
proceeds of a crime or an instrumentality of a crime.
(d) In a forfeiture action commenced by a claiming authority
against a defendant, the following rebuttable presumption
shall apply: all currency or negotiable instruments payable to
the bearer shall be presumed to be the proceeds of a
preconviction forfeiture crime when such currency or
negotiable instruments are:
[1] Found in close proximity to a controlled substance
unlawfully possessed by the defendant in an amount
sufficient to constitute a misdemeanor or petty offense as
defined by the New York State Penal Law; or
[2] Found in close proximity to any quantity of a controlled
substance or marijuana unlawfully possessed by such
defendant in a room, other than a public place, under
circumstances evincing an intent to unlawfully mix,
compound, distribute, package or otherwise prepare for
sale such controlled substance or marijuana.
(e) The presumption set forth pursuant to Subsection B(4)(d) of
this section shall be rebutted by credible and reliable evidence
which tends to show that such currency or negotiable
instrument payable to the bearer is not the proceeds of a
preconviction forfeiture crime. In an action tried before a jury,
the jury shall be so instructed. Any sworn testimony of a
defendant offered to rebut the presumption and any other
evidence which is obtained as a result of such testimony shall
be inadmissible in any subsequent proceeding relating to the
forfeiture action or in any other civil or criminal action, except
in a prosecution for a violation of Article 210 of the Penal Law.
In an action tried before a jury, at the commencement of the
trial or at such other time as the court reasonably directs, the
claiming authority shall provide notice to the court and to the
defendant of its intent to request that the court charge such
presumption.
§ 116-10 HUDSON CODE § 116-11
116:236
§ 116-11. Validity of settlements.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall affect the validity of a settlement
of any forfeiture action negotiated between the claiming authority and a
criminal defendant contemporaneously with the taking of a plea of guilty
in a criminal action to any misdemeanor or petty offense as defined in this
chapter.
§ 116-12. Summons.
An action for forfeiture shall be commenced by service of a summons with
notice or summons and verified complaint.
§ 116-13. Remission.
In addition to any other relief provided under this chapter, at any time
within one year after the entry of a judgment of forfeiture, any person
claiming an interest in the property, subject to forfeiture, who did not
receive actual notice of the forfeiture action, may petition the judge before
whom the forfeiture action was held for a remission or mitigation of the
forfeiture and restoration of the property or the proceeds of any sale
resulting from the forfeiture, or such part thereof, as may be claimed by
him. The court may restore said property upon such terms and conditions
as it deems reasonable and just if:
§ 116-14. Amounts of recovery.
A. The petitioner establishes that he or she was without actual knowledge
of the forfeiture action or any related proceeding for a provisional
remedy and did not know or should not have known that the forfeited
property was connected to a crime or fraudulently conveyed; and
B. The court determines that restoration of the property would serve the
ends of justice.
A. The total amount that may be recovered by the claiming authority
against all criminal defendants in a forfeiture action or actions
involving the same crime shall not exceed the value of the proceeds of
the crime or substituted proceeds of the crime, whichever amount is
greater, and, in addition, the value of any forfeited instrumentality used
in the crime. Any such recovery against criminal defendants for the
value of the proceeds of the crime or substituted proceeds of the crime
shall be reduced by an amount which equals the value of the same
proceeds of the same crime or the same substituted proceeds of the
same crime recovered against all noncriminal defendants. Any such
recovery for the value of an instrumentality of a crime shall be reduced
by an amount which equals the value of the same instrumentality
recovered against any noncriminal defendant.
B. The total amount that may be recovered against all noncriminal
defendants in a forfeiture action or actions involving the same crime
§ 116-11 CRIME PROCEEDS, FORFEITURE OF § 116-14
116:237
§ 116-15. Settlement agreements to be filed.
Any stipulation or settlement agreement between the parties to a forfeiture
action shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which the forfeiture action
is pending.
§ 116-16. Provisional remedies.
shall not exceed the value of the proceeds of the crime or the
substituted proceeds of the crime, whichever amount is greater, and, in
addition, the value of any forfeited instrumentality used in the crime.
Any such recovery against the noncriminal defendants for the value
of the proceeds of the crime or substituted proceeds of the crime
shall be reduced by an amount which equals the value of the proceeds
of the crime or substituted proceeds of the crime recovered against
all criminal defendants. A judgment against a noncriminal defendant
pursuant to local law shall be limited to the amount of the proceeds
of the crime. Any recovery for the value of an instrumentality of the
crime shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the same
instrumentality recovered against any criminal defendant.
A. The provisional remedies of attachment, injunction and receivership
shall be available in all actions for a money judgment under this
chapter.
B. On a motion for a provisional remedy, the claiming authority shall state
whether any other provisional remedy has previously been sought in
the same action against the same defendant. The court may require the
claiming authority to elect between those remedies to which it would
otherwise be entitled.
C. A court may grant an application for a provisional remedy when it
determines that:
(1) There is a substantial probability that the claiming authority will
prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order
may result in the property being destroyed, removed from the
jurisdiction of the court or otherwise be unavailable for forfeiture;
or
(2) The need to preserve the availability of the property through the
entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party
against whom the order may operate.
D. Upon motion of any party against whom a provisional remedy is in
effect, the court may issue an order modifying or vacating such
provisional remedy if necessary to permit the moving party to obtain
funds for the payment of reasonable living expenses, other costs or
expenses related to the maintenance, operation or preservation of
property which is the subject of any such provisional remedy or
reasonable. Any such motion shall be supported by an affidavit

116:238
§ 116-17. Public auction.
Except for property that the Legal Advisor or District Attorney determines
would aid law enforcement within the City of Hudson and property as
defined in this chapter, any property forfeited pursuant to the procedures
established by this chapter shall be sold at public auction after having been
advertised by the appropriate claiming agency in the official newspaper of
the city once per week for a period of four weeks and by written notice
posted for a period of four weeks in a suitable location to be designated by
the claiming agency for such purpose.
§ 116-18. Apportioned payments.
The proceeds of a sale and any other moneys realized as a consequence of
any forfeiture pursuant to this chapter shall be apportioned and paid in the
following descending order of priority:
§ 116-19. Use of distributed moneys. [Amended 1-16-2001 by L.L.
No. 2-2001]
All moneys distributed to the claiming authority and paid into the Hudson
Police Department/Petty Offense Forfeiture Fund, maintained by the City
Treasurer, shall be used to enhance law enforcement efforts at the
discretion of the Legal Advisor to the City of Hudson or the Police
Commissioner.
Chapter 124
establishing the unavailability of other assets of the moving party which
are not the subject of such provisional remedy for payment of such
expenses or fees.
A. Amounts ordered to be paid by the court in satisfaction of any lien or
claim against the property forfeited. A fine imposed pursuant to the
Penal Law shall not be deemed to constitute a lien or claim for purposes
of this section;
B. Amounts ordered to be paid by the defendant in any other action or
proceeding as restitution, reparations or damages to a victim of the
crime, which crime constitutes the basis upon which forfeiture was
effected under this chapter, to the extent such amounts remain unpaid;
C. Amounts actually expended by a claiming authority or claiming agent,
which amounts are substantiated by vouchers or other evidence for the
maintenance, operation, storage, sale and the like which is required by
circumstances attendant to either the commission of the crime or the
forfeiture action;

be paid into the Hudson Police Department/Petty Offense Forfeiture

level.
(1) If the structure is to be elevated, fully enclosed areas below the
base flood elevation shall be designed to automatically (without
human intervention) allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters for
the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or a licensed architect or meet the
following criteria:
(a) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.

practice to make the structure watertight, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy.
(b) A licensed professional engineer or licensed land surveyor
shall certify the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea

§ 148-15. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as
floodways (see definition, § 148-4). The floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to high-velocity floodwaters carrying debris and posing additional
threats from potential erosion forces. When floodway data is available for a
particular site as provided by § 148-12B, all encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements and other development, are
prohibited within the limits of the floodway unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3) The local administrator shall maintain on record a copy of all such
certificates noted in this section.
C. Construction standards for areas of special flood hazard without base
flood elevations.
(1) New construction or substantial improvements of structures,
including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to at least two feet above the highest
adjacent grade next to the proposed foundation of the structure.
(2) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically (without human
intervention) allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters for the
purpose of equalizing hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or a licensed architect or meet the
following criteria:
(a) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.
(b) The bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one
foot above the lowest adjacent finished grade.
(c) Openings may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or
other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

§ 148-16. Appeals Board.
A. The Planning Commission, as established by Common Council, shall
hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
B. The Hudson Community Development and Planning Agency shall hear
and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision or determination made by the local administrator
in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Commission may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Planning Commission shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and Floodplain Management Program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding.
§ 148-16 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 148-16
148:279
§ 148-17. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations and
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.

including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that § 148-16D(1)
through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures and contributing structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this chapter.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
§ 148-16 HUDSON CODE § 148-17
148:280
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk.

A certificate of appropriateness is required to carry out any exterior
alteration, additions, restoration, reconstruction, demolition, new
construction, or moving of a landmark or property within an historic
district, or to make any material change in the appearance of such a
property or its windows, or install or move a satellite dish. This certificate
is to be obtained prior to obtaining a building permit. A certificate of
appropriateness must be obtained even if a building permit is not required.
Noncontributing properties within an historic district must also follow the
same procedure. An application for a certificate of appropriateness for the
alteration or addition of a sign in an historic district or associated with a
landmark may only be submitted to the Historic Preservation Commission
after issuance by the Building Inspector of an erection permit pursuant to
Chapter 244.
§ 169-6. Criteria for approval of certificate of appropriateness.
E. Upon designation, the Commission shall forward notice of each
property designated as a landmark and the boundaries of each
designated historic district to the offices of the Columbia County Clerk
for recording.
A. In passing on an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Historic Preservation Commission shall not consider changes to interior
spaces unless they are specifically landmarked. The Commission's
decision shall be based on the following principles:
(1) Properties that contribute to the character of the historic district
shall be retained, with their historic features altered as little as
possible;
(2) Any alteration of existing properties shall be compatible with their
historic character, as well as with the surrounding district; and
(3) New construction shall be compatible with the district in which it is
located.
B. In applying the principle of compatibility, the Commission shall
consider the following factors:
(1) The general design, character, and appropriateness to the property
of the proposed alteration or new construction;
(2) The scale of the proposed alteration or new construction in relation
to the property itself, surrounding properties, and the
neighborhood;
(3) Texture, materials, and color and their relation to similar features
of other properties in the neighborhood;
§ 169-4 HUDSON CODE § 169-6
161:310
§ 169-7. Certificate of appropriateness application procedure.
(4) Visual compatibility with surrounding properties, including
proportion of the property's front facade, proportion and
arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade,
roof shape, and the rhythm of spacing of properties on streets,
including setback; and
(5) The importance of historic, architectural, or other features to the
significance of the property.
A. Prior to the commencement of any work requiring a certificate of
appropriateness, the owner shall file an application for such a
certificate with the Historic Preservation Commission. The application
shall contain: [Amended 8-15-2006 by L.L. No. 11-2006]

showing the type of lettering to be used, all dimensions and colors,
a description of materials to be used, the method of illumination, a
plan showing the sign's location on the property, and a copy of the
signed erection permit issued by the Building Inspector;
[Amended 6-15-2010 by L.L. No. 3-2010]
(8) Any other information that the Commission may reasonably require
in order to visualize the proposed work; and
(9) Application must be signed and dated by the owner of record.
B. No building permit shall be issued for such proposed work until a
certificate of appropriateness has first been issued by the Historic
Preservation Commission. The certificate of appropriateness required
by this chapter shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building
permit that may be required by any other ordinance of the City of
Hudson.
C. The Commission shall approve, deny, or approve the permit with
modifications within 60 days from receipt of the completed application.
The Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application, at which
an opportunity will be provided for proponents and opponents of the
application to present their views. The Commission may waive the

E. Certificates of appropriateness shall be valid for 12 months, after which
time the owner must reapply if he/she wishes to undertake work on the
property.
A. An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed
demolition has been denied may apply for relief on the ground of
hardship. In order to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant
shall establish that:
(1) The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return,
regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable
return possible;
(2) The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the
current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a
reasonable return; and
(3) Good faith efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the
property and preserving it have failed.
B. Demolition shall be permitted only after the owner of the site has
submitted and obtained design approval of his/her plans for new
development under the provisions of this chapter, including an
acceptable timetable and guarantees, which may include performance
bonds for demolition and completion of the project. In no case shall the
time between demolition and commencement of new construction or lot
improvement exceed six months.

It shall be the duty of the Building Code Enforcement Officer to inspect
periodically any such work to assure compliance. In the event work is
found that is not being performed in accordance with the certificate of
appropriateness, or upon notification of such fact by the Historic
Preservation Commission, the Building Code Enforcement Officer shall
issue a stop-work order and all work shall immediately cease. No further
work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop-work order is in

design, material, color, or outward appearance. No owner or person with
an interest in real property designated as a landmark or included within
an historic district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of
disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural
feature which would, in the judgment of the Historic Preservation

district as a whole or the life and character of the property itself. Examples
of such deterioration include:

§ 174-9. Relocation assistance.
B. Before obligation or expending funds provided under this part for any
activity that will directly result in the demolition of low-/moderateincome
dwelling units or the conversion of low-/moderate-income
dwelling units to another use, the City of Hudson must make public and
submit the following information, in writing, to HUD:
(1) A description of the proposed assisted activity.

units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be demolished or
converted to a use other than for low-/moderate-income dwelling
units as a direct result of the assisted activity.
(3) A time schedule for the commencement and completion of the
demolition or conversion.
(4) The general location on a map and approximate number of dwelling
units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be provided as

vacant low-/moderate-income dwelling units in standard condition
available on a nondiscriminatory basis within the City of Hudson in
accordance with 24 CFR 570.606(b)(1)(iii).
A. Each low- or moderate-income household that is displaced by
demolition or by the conversion of a low-/moderate-income dwelling
unit to another use as a direct result of an activity assisted under this
part shall be provided with relocation assistance. The low- or moderateincome
household may elect to receive relocation assistance described
at 24 CFR Part 42, or may elect to receive the following relocation
assistance:
(1) Relocation notices must be issued consistent with and in the
manner prescribed under 24 CFR 42.203. The definition of
"comparable replacement dwelling" used in 24 CFR Part 42 is
modified as described in § 174-11 of this article. Displaced
households provided with replacement housing assistance under
Subsection A(3) of this section, in the form of a certificate or
housing voucher under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act
of 1937, must be provided referrals to comparable replacement
dwelling units whose owners are willing to participate in the
§ 174-8 HUDSON CODE § 174-9
174:320
housing voucher or certificate program. The City of Hudson shall
advise tenants of their rights under the Federal Fair Housing Law
(Title VIII) and of replacement housing opportunities in such a

further fair housing.
(2) The reasonable and necessary cost of any security deposit required
to rent the replacement dwelling unit and credit checks required to
rent or purchase the replacement dwelling unit.
(3) Households are eligible to receive one of the following forms of
replacement housing assistance.
(a) Each household must be offered compensation designed to
ensure that, for a five-year period, the displaced household will
not bear, after relocation, a ratio of shelter costs to income that
exceeds 30%. Such compensation shall be either:
[1] A certificate or housing voucher for rental assistance
provided through the Local Public Housing Agency under
Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; or
[2] Cash rental assistance equal to 60 times the amount that is
obtained by subtracting 30% of the displaced household's
monthly gross income, with such adjustments as the City
of Hudson may deem appropriate, from the lesser of the
monthly cost of rent and utilities at a comparable
replacement dwelling unit or the monthly cost of rent and
utilities at the decent, safe and sanitary replacement
dwelling to which the household relocates. The City of
Hudson may provide the cash payment in either a lump
sum or in installments. The City of Hudson may at its
discretion offer the household a choice between the
certificate/housing voucher or cash rental assistance.
(b) If the household purchases an interest in a housing cooperative
or mutual housing association and occupies a decent, safe and
sanitary unit in the cooperative or association, the household
may elect to receive a lump sum payment. This lump sum
payment shall be equal to the capitalized value of 60 monthly
installments of the amount that is obtained by subtracting 30%
of the displaced household's monthly gross income, with such
adjustments as the City of Hudson may deem appropriate, from
the monthly cost of rent and utilities at a comparable
replacement dwelling unit. To compute the capitalized value,
the installments shall be discounted at the rate of interest paid
on passbook savings deposits by a federally insured bank or
savings and loan institution conducting business within the
City of Hudson's jurisdiction. To the extent necessary to
§ 174-9 HOUSING POLICY § 174-9
174:321
§ 174-10. Definitions.

indicated:
minimize hardship to the household, the City of Hudson shall,
subject to appropriate safeguards, issue a payment in advance
of the purchase of the interest in the housing cooperative or
mutual housing association.
B. Eligibility for relocation assistance. A low- or moderate-income
household that is required to move as a direct result of demolition or
conversion of a low-/moderate-income dwelling unit to another use is
eligible for relocation assistance under this subsection if:
(1) The household is required to move from the dwelling unit on or

celebrations and other public events which are privately sponsored but
open to the public. Events of this kind serve to improve the quality of life
and economic well-being of the residents of the City. They may also result in
large numbers of people congregating within the confines of the temporarily
closed streets or public places, and the resulting crowd conditions create
concerns for police and fire access and control and other concerns relating
to the health, safety and welfare of the public and of persons and property in
the area. It is therefore essential that a policy be established for governing
these events which shall facilitate control over them by the sponsor and by
City officials from departments involved with the event to safeguard persons
and property.
§ 199-2. Definitions.
The following words, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings
herein stated, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:

SPECIAL EVENT  A preplanned single event or series of events that,
because of its nature, interest, location, promotion or any combination of
similar influences, is expected to draw 50 or more people and/or vehicular
traffic, sponsored by an individual or entity other than the City, proposed
to be held on public property or on private property but affecting public
property or requiring City support services, for the purpose(s) of
entertainment, celebration, amusement, cultural recognition, arts and
crafts displays and/or sales, amateur sports demonstration or competition,
block parties, parades, races, or similar activities.
SPONSOR  The individual, group or individuals, corporation or other
entity responsible for organizing the event.

to protect the safety, health, property and general welfare of its citizens.
Examples include crowd management and control, traffic management and
control, and fire protection.
§ 199-3. City responsibility.
The City is responsible for determining whether to issue permits and
licenses for special events and establishing guidelines for the safe and
proper conduct of such special events. To fulfill these responsibilities the
City must determine if a special event should be conducted and the terms
and conditions under which an approved event may be conducted.

192:345
§ 199-4. Sponsor responsibility. [Amended 6-17-2014 by L.L. No.
8-2014]
It is the sponsor's responsibility to make an application to conduct a special
event or parade as provided in this chapter and to furnish any additional
information that may be requested. It is the sponsor's responsibility to make
any notifications specified in this chapter and to abide by all of the terms
and conditions established as part of the approval process. It shall be the
sponsor's responsibility to provide for the protection of the safety, health,
property and general welfare of those attending and participating in the
special event or parade as well as the adjacent properties.
§ 199-5. Application and cost estimation.
§ 199-6. Approval process.
A. Application. The sponsor must submit an application to the City Clerk at
least 120 days prior to the event. The City Clerk shall check the
application for completeness and forward a complete application to the
Mayor or his designee for approval. The Mayor may meet with the
sponsor to review the obligations of various City departments and the
sponsor. The sponsor must supplement the application as new
information is learned or obtained, including the addition of sponsors.
The Mayor shall render his decision on a completed application no less
than 20 days and no greater than 45 days after receipt of a completed
application. All permit applications and applicable fees must be
submitted 14 days prior to the start of the event, including those related
to fireworks, concession stands and amusement rides. Application

B. City costing process. The completed application shall be distributed by
the City Clerk to the appropriate City departments and agencies, which
will estimate the additional costs that would be incurred as a result of
the event. This information may be used in establishing terms and
conditions under which an event may be conducted when the use of
police or other City personnel is appropriate, possible and not in
conflict with any other administrative policies and procedures and/or
labor agreements.
A. Review, general. The Mayor will review, approve or disapprove each
proposed special event on its own merits. In reviewing a proposed
special event, the Mayor will also review, evaluate and determine the
costs of City support services required for the special event that will be
charged to all sponsors unless the Mayor waives all or any portion of
these costs if such a waiver is in the best interest of the City. The Mayor
will consider various criteria and factors, including but not limited to:

(1) Does the City have the ability to provide the required support
services regardless of who bears the cost?

special event or activity?

rights of the neighbors?

submitted, make unilateral modifications or make modifications in
cooperation with the sponsor. The Mayor shall render his decision in
writing with reasons for conditions or denial specified.

Mayor within 30 days to the full Common Council, which may
recommend that it overturn the decision after a hearing. The decision of
the Common Council will be final.

street closure(s), the applicant must cause to be posted in the
newspaper of record notice of such application within seven days of
submitting an application for a special event or parade to the City

meeting any other requirements which may be applicable.
§ 199-6 LOITERING § 199-8

event or parade, a minimum limit of $3,000,000 for liability arising from
the sale or consumption of alcohol, with the City named as an additional
insured, or a larger amount in the discretion of the Mayor. This
insurance shall satisfy all insurance requirements for the City for

parking must be posted 12 hours in advance and maintained by the
sponsor. The actual time of the event shall be posted on these signs.

structure, the sponsor is responsible for erecting the tent or other
temporary structure and maintaining that tent or temporary
structure. The sponsor is responsible for dismantling the tent or
other temporary structure upon conclusion of the event, when the
necessity for the tent or other temporary structure ceases or upon
order of the City.
(9) Parades, motorcades and road races. Sponsors requesting to

against any damage to streets or public property and any cleanup expenses
incurred by the City as a result of the permitted event. The cash deposit
will be returned to the applicant if the City finds that no damage has been
committed or cleanup required. The unused portion of any cash deposit

such as land clearing, grading, earthmoving, excavating, blasting,
filling and landscaping.
DECIBEL  The measurement units of sound level: 1/10 of a bel; a
unit of measure used to express either: (1) The absolute sound pressure
level as the logarithm of the sound power or intensity to a reference
sound pressure of 20 micronewtons per square meter; or (2) The
relative difference in sound pressure level, in sound power or intensity,
between two acoustic signals, equal to 10 times the common logarithm
of the ratio of the two sound powers or intensities, or the arithmetic
difference in absolute sound pressure levels.
EMERGENCY SIGNAL DEVICE  Any gong, horn, whistle or siren, the
use of which is permitted on emergency vehicles pursuant to § 375 of
the Vehicle and Traffic Law.

§ 260-5 SOLID WASTE § 260-8
260:489
complying with all the provisions of this article or fails to comply with
§ 260-7, the Department may do either of the following:
(1) The Department may choose not to collect the refuse or other
waste material. In such a case the Department shall affix a notice to

the date of the bill for such charges. All hearings shall be on a date
and time and at a place determined by the Superintendent. The
hearing shall be informal and held before the Superintendent or his
designee. The decision of the Superintendent shall be final. Any
service charges not paid by the due date or within 30 days after the
Superintendent's decision shall become a lien upon the real
property, superior to any other lien or claim, except the lien of an
existing tax assessment or charge imposed by the City of Hudson.
B. Whenever refuse or other waste material has been placed for collection
by the Department after 7:30 a.m. on the day of collection, the
Department may, in its own discretion, determine to respond positively
or negatively to a request by the property owner of the property from
which such waste was generated that the Department return to such
property and collect that waste material. When the Department agrees
to return to the property and collect that material, it shall assess a
special service charge against that property owner in accord with
Subsection A(2) of this section.
C. For any nonscheduled collection of waste material by the Department,
the Department shall assess a special service charge against the
responsible property owner. Such special collection charge shall be in
accord with the provisions of Subsection A(2) of this section.
§ 260-8 HUDSON CODE § 260-9

§ 260-9. Ownership of recyclables placed for collection.
From the time any person places any properly prepared recyclable
materials at or near any curb, sidewalk, alley or street for purposes of
collection by the Department, those recyclable materials shall become and
be the property of the City of Hudson or its authorized agent. No person
who is not acting under authority of the City or its authorized agent shall
collect, pick up, remove or cause to be collected, picked up or removed
any recyclable materials so placed for collection. Each such unauthorized
collection, pickup or removal shall constitute a separate violation of this
article.
§ 260-10. Private waste haulers.
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent any person from entering
into a contractual agreement with a private waste hauler for the removal of
refuse and other waste materials generated by that person or at property
owned by that person.
§ 260-11. Containers for recyclables.
The Superintendent is authorized to establish an appropriate mechanism
for selling or facilitating the sale or distribution of blue boxes for recyclable
materials.
§ 260-12. Adoption and enforcement of regulations.

are consistent with this article and to continue to enforce any existing
regulations that are consistent with this article.

fees for the collection of any refuse (other than recyclable materials),
rubble, bulk items or industrial waste. After any such fees are imposed,
the manner of implementation and collection shall be by regulation of the
Superintendent not inconsistent with the terms of the resolution imposing
such fees.
§ 260-14. Penalties for offenses.
A. Any person who commits a violation of this article shall be punished as
follows: by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 15 days or by a fine
not exceeding $250, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

period of one year to substantially alter, remove, replace or rebuild such
fence upon obtaining from the Building Inspector a certificate of
substantial compliance, as hereinafter provided:

§ 275-1. Imposition and rate of tax. [Last amended 4-20-2004 by
L.L. No. 3-2004]
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 20-b of the General City Law of the
State of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from and after

of Hudson which is subject to the supervision of the State Department of
Public Service, which has a gross income for the 12 months ending May 31
in excess of $500, except motor carriers or brokers, and a tax equal to 1%
of its gross operating income is hereby imposed from and after July 1, 1937,
upon every other utility doing business in the City of Hudson which has a
gross operating income for the 12 months ending May 31 in excess of $500,
which taxes shall have application only within the territorial limits of the
City of Hudson and shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees
imposed by any other provision of law for the same period. Such taxes shall
not be imposed on any transaction originating or consummated outside of
the territorial limits of the City of Hudson, notwithstanding that some act be
necessarily performed with respect to such transaction within such limits.
§ 275-2. Definitions. [Amended 6-9-1938 by L.L. No. 10-1938;
5-29-1941 by L.L. No. 1-1941; 4-20-2004 by L.L. No. 3-2004]
The terms used in this article, including "gross income," "gross operating
income," "person" and "utility," shall have the meanings set forth in
Subdivision 2 of § 186-a of the Tax Law.
§ 275-3. Required records; preservation of records.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of
its business and in such form as the City Treasurer may require, and such
records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the
City Treasurer may consent to their destruction within that period or may
require that they be kept longer.
§ 275-4. Submission of tax returns. [Amended last 6-29-1950 by L.L.
No. 5-1950]
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before September 25,
December 25, March 25 and June 25, a return for the three calendar months
preceding each return date, including any period for which the tax imposed
hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective, each of which returns shall
state the gross income or gross operating income for the period covered
by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the City Treasurer of the
City of Hudson on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and
shall contain such other data, information or matter as the City Treasurer
§ 275-1 SWIMMING POOLS § 275-4
271:505
of the City of Hudson may require to be included therein. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this section, any utility whose average gross
income or average gross operating income, as the case may be, for the
aforesaid three months' period is less than $1,500 may file a return annually
on June 25 for the 12 preceding calendar months, and the City Treasurer
of the City of Hudson may require any utility doing business in the City of
Hudson to file an annual return, which shall contain any data specified by
the City Treasurer of the City of Hudson, regardless of whether the utility is
subject to tax under this article. The City Treasurer of the City of Hudson,
in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at any time a
further or supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may be
specified by the City Treasurer of the City of Hudson. Every return shall
have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same,
or of a copartner thereof, or of a principal officer of the corporation if such
business is conducted by a corporation, to the effect that the statements
contained therein are true.
§ 275-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall pay
to the City Treasurer the tax imposed by this article for the period covered
by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of filing the
return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the
return is required to be filed.
§ 275-6. Imposition of tax when return not filed. [Amended
6-29-1939 by L.L. No. 1-1939]
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the City Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient return
is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from the
City Treasurer, or if no return is made for any period, the City Treasurer
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is
able to obtain, and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. The City Treasurer shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall
finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the person against whom it
is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the City Treasurer for a hearing, or unless the City
Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing,
the City Treasurer shall give notice of his decision to the person liable
for the tax. The decision of the City Treasurer may be reviewed by a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of the State of New
York if application therefor is made within 30 days after the giving of notice
of such decision. An order to review such decision shall not be granted
unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and
penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the City Treasurer
and an undertaking filed with him, in such amount and with such sureties
as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if
such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant will
§ 275-4 HUDSON CODE § 275-6
271:506
pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding, or at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be
in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges
aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such
tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such
order.
§ 275-7. Method of serving notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 275-8. Penalty for failure to file return or pay tax.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax
or any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax
for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after
such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the City
Treasurer, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any
portion of such penalty.
§ 275-9. Tax refunds. [Amended 6-29-1939 by L.L. No. 1-1939]
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof and the City Treasurer
or the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the City Treasurer shall refund the
amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund
may be so made on the initiative of the City Treasurer. However, no refund
shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the
City Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the City Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion, shall have reduced
the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of the State of New York that such
determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of
moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund, made
as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision
of any tax or penalty complained of and the City Treasurer may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making this determination,
the City Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and he
shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said Article
§ 275-6 SWIMMING POOLS § 275-9
271:507
78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the granting
of such an order.
§ 275-10. Tax not to be added to bills to customers.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 275-11. Actions to enforce payment.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Legal Advisor shall, upon the request of the City Treasurer, bring
an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any judgment
obtained in any such action shall be paid to the City Treasurer. Each such
tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to
pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and
penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.

[Adopted 4-19-2011 by L.L. No. 2-2011]
§ 275-20. Procedure for redemption.
A. The City Treasurer, prior to auction of parcels acquired in Real Property
Law Article 11,125 may permit the previous owner of record to
repurchase his or her parcel through release of the City's interest. The
purchase price of such parcel shall be the total of the outstanding real
property taxes, assessments, charges, interest, fees and penalties due
and owing prior to the expiration of the redemption period, plus any
interest and charges which have accrued up to the time the release of
the City's interest as approved. All releases of the City's interest must
be approved by a 3/4 vote of the Common Council. Notice of the right to
redeem shall be sent by certified mail and regular mail to the aforesaid
owner's last address within 30 days of a court order conveying title to
the premises to the City of Hudson. Any owner wishing to avail himself
of the option to redeem must notify the City Treasurer by certified mail
or personal service of his or her repurchase within 30 days from when
notice is sent. To redeem, the homeowner must tender a certified check
constituting the entire purchase price of said parcel.
B. Should a homeowner exercise his option to redeem pursuant to
Subsection A, the City Attorney shall effect the release of the City's
interest in the property acquired by tax sale by preparing and
submitting to the appropriate court an order discontinuing the in rem
tax foreclosure action as to said property, canceling the notice of
pendency of such action as to said property, and vacating and setting
aside the judgment of foreclosure and the deed executed and recorded
pursuant to such judgment of foreclosure as to said property. The entry
of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees
and any and all lienors, receivers and administrators and
encumbrancers, to the status they held at the time the City acquired
title to said property, as if the judgment had never been rendered, and
shall render said property liable for all taxes, deficiencies, mortgages,
fees and liens, penalties, interest, and other charges which shall accrue
subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the release provided for in
this section, or which were, for whatever reason, omitted from the
payment made to obtain such release.

[Adopted 3-21-2017 by L.L. No. 1-2017; amended in its entirety
11-26-2019 by L.L. No. 3-2019]

indicated, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
CITY  The City of Hudson.
HOST  The person who owns, or otherwise is in possession of, and thereby
offers to the public, by any means whatsoever now existing or hereinafter

lodging; provided, however, this term shall not include a booking agent or
like instrumentality including, by way of illustration and without limitation,
Airbnb, VRBO, and similar services regardless of the methodology such

article, which is sometimes referred to as "tax" herein.
NET TAX REVENUES  The amount of lodging tax collected by the City,
exclusive of registration fees, penalties and interest, less the expenses

that is part of such structure, and any structure defined in § 325-42 of this
code (or successor thereto) as a "trailer."
OCCUPANCY  The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession,
of any room for short-term lodging.

right to use or possess any room subject to the lodging tax.

more persons and that is made available for short-term lodging by the host
thereof. Neither a noncompliant structure nor any part thereof is a room as
herein defined.
§ 275-22 SWIMMING POOLS § 275-22
271:523
SHORT-TERM LODGING  Any room let by the host thereof to a third party
or parties for use as a lodging for a period of not more than 29 consecutive
days.
§ 275-23. Tax imposed; applicability.
§ 275-24. Transitional provisions.
The tax imposed by this article shall be paid upon any occupancy on or after
June 1, 2017, although such occupancy is pursuant to a prior contract, lease
or other arrangement. Where rent is paid on a weekly or other term basis,
the rent shall be subject to the tax imposed by this article to the extent it
covers any period on or after June 1, 2017.
A. In addition to any other tax authorized by any other taxing jurisdiction
on the provision of short-term lodging within the City, there is hereby
imposed a tax of 4% per day of the rent for a room used to provide
short-term lodging and any and all charges and fees ancillary thereto
including, without limitation, cleaning fees, linen fees, key fees and like
charges and fees. The tax imposed hereby shall be paid by the person
liable therefor to the host of the room occupied or to the person entitled
to be paid the rent or charge for the room occupied for and on account
of the City of Hudson imposing the tax, and that such host shall be liable
for the collection and payment of the tax; and that such host or person
entitled to be paid the rent or charge shall have the same right in
respect to collecting the tax from the person occupying the room, or in
respect to nonpayment of the tax by the person occupying the room, as
if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the same time
as the rent or charge for such room; provided, however, that the City
Treasurer shall be joined as a party in any action or proceeding brought
to collect the tax by the owner or by the person entitled to be paid the
rent or charge.
B. Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, the tax
imposed by this article shall not apply to a single room (that may
include an en suite bathroom) occupied for short-term lodging provided
that such single room is in the host's sole residence within the City of
Hudson and which is such host's primary residence, no more than one
such room is offered for short-term lodging within such residence, and
access and egress (except for emergency egress) to such single room is
solely through the host's primary residence and identical to the access
and egress portal used by the host to access and exit such primary
residence.
C. Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, any entity
exempt from paying New York State sales taxes shall, upon providing
their host with reasonably adequate proof of such exemption, be
exempt from the tax established by this article.
§ 275-22 HUDSON CODE § 275-25
271:524
§ 275-25. Exempt organizations.
Except as otherwise provided in this article, any use or occupancy by any of
the following shall not be subject to the tax imposed by this article:
§ 275-26. Territorial limitations.
The tax imposed by this article shall only apply within the territorial limits
of the City of Hudson, New York.
§ 275-27. Registration; certificate of authority.
A. The State of New York or any of its agencies, instrumentalities, public
corporations (including a public corporation created pursuant to
agreement or compact with another state or Canada), improvement
districts or political subdivisions of the state;

instrumentalities, insofar as it is immune from taxation;
C. Any corporation, association, trust or community chest, fund or
foundation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable

animals and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of
any private shareholder or individual and no substantial part of the
activities of which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting
to influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing in this
subsection shall include an organization operated for the primary
purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit, whether or not all
of its profits are payable to one or more organizations described in this
subsection;
A. Within 20 days after the effective date of this article, or in the case of
hosts entering into the marketplace after such effective date, within
three days after offering short-term lodging, every host shall file a
registration application with the City Treasurer on the form prescribed
by that official.
B. Thereafter, all hosts shall annually register with the City Treasurer on
the form prescribed by the City Treasurer, which form may require a
separate registration form for each real property legal parcel for which
the host rents out rooms, or require that all such legal parcels be
separately identified on one registration form. With respect to each real
property legal parcel, such registration application form shall identify
the host, the owner of the real property, the lessee of the real property
(if any), the social security number or employment identification
number of the host, the mailing address, phone number and email
address of the host, owner and lessee, the number and identity of each
distinct address where the host offers short-term lodging within the
City, the number of rooms at each such location, and over the course of
the calendar year, the maximum and the minimum gross nightly rate
§ 275-25 SWIMMING POOLS § 275-27
271:525
§ 275-28. Administration and collection of tax.
that is anticipated to be charged for a room therein (gross nightly rate
includes the total amount charged therefor before application of any
government-mandated taxes that the host charges for the room). If a
real property location has more than one room, and the rates vary by
room, only the maximum and the minimum rate charged at the location
shall be provided, as opposed listing the rates for each room. Such
annual registration form shall be filed by the host between March 1
and March 31 of each year. Upon the filing of each annual registration
form, a host shall pay to the City Treasurer such application fees as
established by resolution of the Hudson Common Council and available
for inspection in the City Clerk's Office. The fees for a first-time
registration shall be prorated relative to the renewal date therefor.
C. Upon filing the annual registration application form and paying the fee
associated therewith, the City Treasurer shall issue to the registering
host a certificate of authority to levy and collect the tax established by
this article on a form prescribed by that official. Each such certificate of
authority shall be specific to the address for which it pertains, shall
recite the name of the host, the address of the short-term lodging
license issued pursuant to this article, and the number of rooms
available for short-term lodging therein. Each certificate of authority
shall be nontransferable and nonassignable.
D. Upon receipt of its certificate of authority pursuant to this article, the
host named thereon shall post the same at the location to which it
pertains in the same manner required of a certificate of authority to
collect sales tax issued by New York State.
E. Every certificate of authority issued pursuant to this article shall be
renewed no later than a date established by the City Treasurer,
provided that such date shall be conspicuously posted on the City's Web
site in a manner reasonably calculated to adequately inform hosts of
their obligation in this regard, and that the renewal deadline date shall
not be changed less than 60 days prior to such date.
A. The tax imposed by this article shall be administered and collected by
the City Treasurer by such means and in such manner as are other
taxes that are now collected and administered or as otherwise provided
by this article.
B. The tax to be collected by the host shall be stated and charged
separately from the rent and shown separately on any record thereof at
the time when the occupancy is arranged, contracted, and/or charged
for and upon every evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement or
charge made for said occupancy issued or delivered by the host, and the
tax shall be paid by the occupant to the host as trustee for and on
account of the City, and the host shall be liable for the collection thereof
and for the tax. The host and any officer of any corporate operator shall
be personally liable for the tax collected or required to be collected
§ 275-27 HUDSON CODE § 275-28
271:526
under this article, and the host shall have the same right in respect to
collecting the tax from the occupant or in respect to nonpayment of the
tax by the occupant as if the tax were part of the rent for the occupancy
payable at the time such tax shall become due and owing, including all
rights of eviction, dispossession, repossession and enforcement of any
judgment in the event of nonpayment of rent by the occupant; provided,
however, that the City Treasurer and the City of Hudson shall be joined
as a party in any action or proceeding brought by the host to collect or
enforce collection of the tax.
C. Each host obligated to pay the tax created by this article shall file with
the City Treasurer a return therefor on a form promulgated by the City
Treasurer for such purpose. Each host filing the return for which shows
a tax due to the City shall pay the tax thereon shown to the City
Treasurer with such return. The return required by this section shall be
filed whether it shows a tax due or not.
D. For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to
prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all
rents are subject to tax until the contrary is established, and the burden
of proving that a rent for occupancy is not taxable hereunder shall be
upon the host or occupant. Where an occupant claims exemptions from
the lodging tax under the provisions of Subsection B of § 275-25 of this
article, the rent shall be deemed taxable hereunder unless the host
shall receive from the occupant claiming such exemption a certificate
duly executed by an exempt entity certifying that the occupant is its
agent, representative or employee, together with a certificate executed
by the occupant that his or her occupancy is paid or to be paid by such
exempt corporation of association, and is necessary or required in the
course of or in connection with the occupant's duties as a
representative of such corporation or association. Where deemed
necessary, the host may further require that any occupant claiming
exemption from the lodging tax furnish a copy of a certificate duly
issued by the City Assessor certifying that the corporation or
association therein named is exempt from the tax under Subsection B of
§ 275-25 of this article.
E. Every host shall file with the City Treasurer a return of occupancy and
of rents and of the taxes payable thereon quarterly. The quarterly
periods for which such tax shall accrue shall end on the last day of
February, May, August and November of each year, and the tax return
shall be filed, and the tax that accrued for such quarterly period paid,
within one month after the end of each such quarterly period.
F. If the host is a New York State sales tax vendor, it shall attach a copy of
its same-period New York State sales tax return to its return pursuant
to this article.
G. If a host is not a New York State sales tax vendor, it shall maintain, in
form and detail, business records sufficient to enable such host to file a
New York State sales tax return for each period in which it is offering
§ 275-28 SWIMMING POOLS § 275-28
271:527
§ 275-29. Records to be kept by host.
Every host shall keep records of every occupancy and of all rent paid,
charged or due thereon and of the tax payable thereon in such form as the
City Treasurer may require. Such records shall be available for inspection
and examination at any time upon demand by the City Treasurer or its
duly authorized agent or employee and shall be preserved for a period of
three years, except that the City Treasurer may consent to their destruction
within that period or may require that they be kept longer.
§ 275-30. Payment of tax.
short-term lodging within the City of Hudson as if such host were a
New York State sales tax vendor. Such records shall be maintained for a
minimum of three years after the return required by this § 275-28 shall
or should have been filed with the City Treasurer as provided by this
§ 275-28.
H. If a return required by this article is not filed or if a return, when filed,
is incorrect or insufficient on its face, the City Treasurer shall take the
necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or of a corrected
return.
A. At the time of filing a return of occupancy and of rents, each host shall
pay to the City Treasurer the taxes imposed by this article upon the
rents required to be included in such return, as well as all other moneys
collected by the host acting or purporting to act under the provisions of
this article.
B. Where the City Treasurer, in its discretion, deems it necessary to
protect revenues to be obtained by this article, it may require any host
required to collect the tax imposed by this article to file with it a bond,
issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state
and approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to
solvency and responsibility, in such amount as the City Treasurer may
fix to secure the payment of any tax and/or penalties and interest due or
which may become due from such host. In the event that the City
Treasurer determines that a host is to file such bond, it shall give notice
to such host to that effect, specifying the amount of the bond required.
The host shall file such bond within five days after the giving of such
notice unless, within five such days, the host shall request, in writing, a
hearing before the City Treasurer at which the necessity, propriety and
amount of the bond shall be determined by the City Treasurer. Such
determination shall be final and shall be complied with within 15 days
after the giving of notices thereof. In lieu of such bond, securities
approved by the City Treasurer or cash in such amount as it may
prescribe may be deposited, which shall be kept in the custody of the
City Treasurer, who may at any time, without notice of the depositor,
apply them to any tax and/or interest or penalties due, and for that

If a return required to be filed by this article is not filed or if a return, when
filed, is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined
by the City Treasurer from such information as may be obtainable, and,
if necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices,
such as number of rooms, locations, comparable lodging rates, type of
accommodations and service and/or other factors. Notice of such
determination shall be given to the person or entity liable for the collection
and payment of the tax, and the owner of the real property against whom
it is assessed. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax
unless the host and owner of the real property against whom it is assessed,
within 30 days after giving notice of such determination, shall apply to the
City Treasurer for a hearing or unless the City Treasurer on its own motion
shall redetermine the same. After such hearing, the City Treasurer shall
give notice of its determination to the host, owner and/or lessee of the real
property against whom the tax is assessed. The determination of the City
Treasurer shall be reviewable for error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any
other recognizable basis whatsoever by proceeding under Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules if application thereof is made to the Supreme
Court within 30 days after the date of such determination. A proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted
unless:
§ 275-32. Disposition of revenues.
Subject to the provisions of §§ 275-38 and 275-41 of this article, all moneys
received by the City Treasurer under this article shall be paid into the
treasury of the City and shall be credited to and deposited in the general
fund thereof or as otherwise directed by resolution of the City Council;
purpose, the securities may be sold by the City Treasurer at public or
private sale without notice to the depositors thereof.
A. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and
interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the City Treasurer
and there shall be filed with the City Treasurer an undertaking, issued
by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to
solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme
Court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or
the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
B. At the option of the petitioner, such undertaking may be in a sum
sufficient to cover the taxes, interests, and penalties stated in such
determination, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against
such petitioner in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the
petitioner shall not be required to pay such taxes, interests or penalties
as a condition precedent to the application.
§ 275-30 SWIMMING POOLS § 275-32
271:529
provided, however, that the City shall be authorized to retain a portion of
such revenue in such amount as it deems reasonably sufficient to defray the
necessary expenses of the City in administering this tax, including without
limitation the collection thereof, and the enforcement of such collection.
§ 275-33. Proceedings to recover tax.
A. Whenever any owner and/or lessee shall fail to collect and pay over any
tax and/or to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this law as
therein provided, the City Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request
of the City Treasurer, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce
the payment of the same on behalf of the City of Hudson in any court of
the State of New York or of any other state or of the United States. The
proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to
the City Treasurer. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the
property of the person liable to pay the same. If, however, the City
Treasurer in its discretion believes that any such host, officer, occupant
or other person is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or
dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalties might be satisfied,
and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he/she may
declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may
issue a warrant immediately.
B. As an additional or alternate remedy, the City Treasurer may direct the
City Assessor to, in the preparation of the next assessment roll, assess
the amount of such tax or penalty upon the property occupied by the
short-term lodging business giving rise to such tax or penalty, and this
amount shall be levied, collected and enforced in the same manner as
taxes upon said property for City purposes are levied collected, and
enforced.
C. As a further remedy, where the lodging tax upon rents included in a
return is not paid at the time of filing such return or an assessment of
lodging tax made is not paid within 10 days from the date of the notice
of such assessment or where the City Treasurer believes that any host,
occupant or other person subject to the provision of this article is about
to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate assets, or for
any other similar reason he deems it necessary in order to protect
revenues under this article, he may issue a warrant directed to a sheriff
of the County of Columbia or to the sheriff of any other county
commanding said sheriff, to levy upon and sell the real and personal
property of the host or occupant or other person liable for the tax which
may be found within the City for the payment of the amount thereof,
with any penalties and interest and the cost of executing the warrant,
and to return such warrant to the City Treasurer and to pay to the City
Treasurer the money collected by virtue thereof within 60 days after the
receipt of such warrant. The sheriff shall, within five days after the
receipt of the warrant, file with the City Clerk a copy thereof, and
thereupon such City Clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name
of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax,
§ 275-32 HUDSON CODE § 275-33
271:530
penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date
when such copy is filed. The reupon the amount of such warrant so
docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and
personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued.
The sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner
and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions
issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for
services in executing the warrant, the sheriff shall be entitled to the
same fees which he may collect in the same manner. In the discretion
of the City Treasurer, a warrant of like terms, force and effect may
be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the City, and
in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the
powers conferred by law upon sheriffs but shall be entitled to no fee or
compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance
of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the City
Treasurer may, from time to time, issue new warrants and shall also
have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the
City had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been
returned unsatisfied.
D. Whenever a host shall make a sale, transfer, or assignment in bulk of
any part of the whole of a hotel, motel, or lease, or of such host's
business assets, otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, the
purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least 10 days before taking
possession of the subject of the said sale, transfer or assignment, or
paying therefor, notify the City Treasurer by registered mail of the
proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or
not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to or informed the
purchaser, transferee or assignee that any tax is owed pursuant to this
article and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has
knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are
in fact owing.
E. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice
to the City Treasurer as required by Subsection D of this section or
whenever the Treasurer shall inform the purchaser, transferee, or
assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of
money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the
purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the
seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and
lien of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due
the seller, transferor or assignor to the City, and the purchaser,
transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor
or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the
extent of the amount of the City's claim. For failure to comply with the
provisions of this subsection, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in
addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under
the provisions of Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code, shall be
personally liable for the payment determined to be due to the county
from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be

271:533
§ 275-37. Refunds.
purposes of this section, each day that a certificate of authority is not
so posted shall be deemed a separate violation.
D. Failure to comply with a demand for records pursuant to § 275-29 shall
be punishable by a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $250 per

E. The certificate of the City Treasurer to the effect that a tax has not been

shall state the reason therefor in writing. Such application may be made
by the occupant, owner, lessee, or other person who has actually paid
the tax. Such application may also be made by a host who has collected
and paid over such tax to the City Treasurer, provided that the
application is made within one year of the payment by the occupant to
the host, but no actual refund of moneys shall be made to such host

such determination by a proceeding pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil

proceedings be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay
all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding.

Treasurer shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to
the City.

declaratory judgment if it institutes a suit within 30 days after a deficiency

the City Treasurer prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for
costs as provided in § 275-31.
§ 275-40. Disclosure of information prohibited; penalty.

to avail itself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit
shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination
by the City Treasurer made pursuant to § 275-31 of this article unless
it is found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
unconstitutional or otherwise improper by the City Treasurer after
a hearing or of the City Treasurer's own motion or in a proceeding
timely commenced under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules,
pursuant to the provisions of section § 275-31, in which event a refund
or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty
found to have been overpaid.

a comprehensive report showing the tax and other revenue due
hereunder that has been collected by the City within such reporting
period.

continuing or imposing the tax authorized hereby after the expiration of this

§ 275-45. Severability.
If any section or sections of this article shall be declared unconstitutional
or otherwise void and ineffective, the validity of the remainder of the

may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period
so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing

§ 284-1. Purpose; legislative intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Hudson's authority
concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities. The City of Hudson finds that wireless
telecommunications facilities may pose significant concerns to the health,
safety, public welfare, character and environment of the City and its
inhabitants. The City also recognizes that facilitating the development of
wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the
City and of significant benefit to the City and its residents. In order to
insure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities is consistent with the City's land use policies,
the City is adopting a single, comprehensive wireless telecommunications
facilities application and permit process. The intent of this chapter is to
minimize the impact of wireless telecommunications facilities; establish a
fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications; assure
an integrated, comprehensive review of the environmental impacts of such
facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Hudson.

proposed project pursuant to SEQRA, in combination with its review of
the application pursuant to this chapter.
A. Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site
and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance
with the following priorities, (1) being the highest priority and (5) being
the lowest priority.
(1) On existing towers or other structures on City-owned properties;
(2) On existing towers or other structures on other property in the
City;
(3) A new tower on City-owned properties;
(4) On properties in areas zoned for heavy industrial use;
(5) On properties in areas zoned for commercial use.
B. If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above,
then a detailed technical and narrative explanation must be provided as
to why a site of a higher priority was not selected. The person seeking
such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate, technologically, the
reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the
proposed site and the hardship that would be incurred by the applicant
if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
C. An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the site
proposed is the only site leased or selected. An application shall
address collocation as an option. If such option is not proposed, the
applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the City why
collocation is a hardship, such being that it is commercially or
technologically impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting
§ 284-8 TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES § 284-9
284:563
§ 284-10. Shared use.
or prohibiting collocation shall not be a valid basis for any claim of
commercial impracticability or hardship.
D. Notwithstanding the above, the City may approve any she located
within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the City finds
that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the City and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious
effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood.
E. The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority,
demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If
appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed
written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not
selected shall be included with the application.
F. Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the City may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
(1) Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
(2) Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or
historical district;
(3) The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities
which is contrary to an already-stated purpose of a specific zoning
or land use designation;
(4) The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the
reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees
and agents of the City or to employees of the service provider or
other service providers;
(5) Conflicts with the provisions of this chapter.
A. The City, as opposed to the construction of a new tower, shall prefer
locating on existing towers or others structures without increasing the
height. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying
existing towers and all other suitable structures within two miles of the
location of any proposed new tower, unless the applicant can show that
some other distance is more appropriate technologically and
demonstrate conclusively why an existing tower or other suitable
structure cannot be used.
B. An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other suitable
structure shall be required to document the intent of the existing owner
to permit its use by the applicant.

need for the total height of any tower, facility and/or antenna requested
and the basis therefor. Documentation in the form of RF propagation
studies must include all backup data used in the production of the
propagation studies. The propagation studies shall show the coverage
at the requested height and also at a minimum of 10 feet lower, the
combination of which should show the lowest, least-intrusive height
needed. Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the
justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and
essentially within the City, to the extent practicable, unless good cause
is otherwise shown.
B. In no instance shall a tower constructed after the effective date of this
chapter, including allowing for all attachments, exceed that height
which shall permit operation without required artificial lighting of any
kind in accordance with municipal, City, state, and/or any federal
statute, law, local law, City ordinance, code, rule or regulation.
A. wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be artificially lighted or
marked, except as required by law.
B. Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint
of an appropriate color to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be
maintained in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
C. If lighting is required, the applicant shall provide a detailed plan for
sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is
permissible under state and federal regulations. Specifically, this shall
mean eliminating or minimizing the visual effects at or near ground
level.
A. All antennas, towers and other supporting structures, including guy
anchor points and wires, shall be made inaccessible to individuals and

as well as emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment
shelter or cabinet of the applicant and be visible from the access point of
the site and must identify the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. On
tower sites, an FCC registration sign as applicable is also to be present. The
signs shall not be lighted, unless applicable law, rule or regulation requires
lighting. No other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted.
§ 284-15. Lot size; setbacks.
All proposed towers and any other proposed wireless telecommunications
facility structures shall be set back from abutting parcels, recorded rightsof-
way and road and street lines by the greater of the following distances:
a distance equal to the height of the proposed tower or wireless
telecommunications facility structure, plus 10% of the height of the tower
or structure, or the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning
district, whichever is greater. Any accessory structure shall be located so
as to comply with the applicable minimum setback requirements for the
property on which it is situated.

284:566
§ 284-17. Public hearing and notification requirements.
§ 284-18. Action on application for special use permit.
has a balance of at least $5,000. Such additional escrow funds shall be
deposited with the City before any further action or consideration is
taken on the application. In the event that the amount held in escrow
by the City is more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the
conclusion of the project, the remaining balance shall be promptly
refunded to the applicant.
C. The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in Subsection B of this
section may vary with the scope and complexity of the project, the
completeness of the application and other information as may be
needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any
construction or modification.

wireless telecommunications facilities, a public hearing shall be held by
the City, notice of which shall be published in the official newspaper of
the City no less than 10 calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the
public hearing. In order that the City may notify nearby landowners, the
application shall contain the names and address of all landowners
whose property is located within 500 feet of any property line of the lot
or parcel on which the new wireless telecommunications facilities are
proposed to be located.
B. There shall be no public hearing required for an application to collocate
on an existing tower or other structure or a modification at an existing
site, as long as there is no proposed increase in the height of the tower
or structure, including attachments thereto.
C. The City shall schedule the public hearing referred to in Subsection A of
this section once it finds the application is complete. The City, at any

satisfaction of the City in a reasonable period of time, the special use permit
shall be subject to revocation.
§ 284-27. Removal.
A. Under the following circumstances, the City may determine that the
health, safety, and welfare interests of the City warrant and require the
removal of wireless telecommunications facilities:
(1) wireless telecommunications facilities with a permit have been
abandoned (i.e. not used as wireless telecommunications facilities)
for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days or a total of 180 days in
any period of 365 days, except for periods caused by force majeure
or acts of God, in which case, repair or removal shall commence
within 90 days;
(2) Permitted wireless telecommunications facilities fall into such a
state of disrepair that they creates a health or safety hazard;

authorized by, the required special use permit, or any other
necessary authorization and the Special Permit may be revoked.

section, then the City shall notify the holder of the special use permit
for the wireless telecommunications facilities within 48 hours that said
wireless telecommunications facilities are to be removed, the City may
approve an interim temporary use agreement/permit, such as to enable
the sale of the wireless telecommunications facilities.
C. The holder of the special use permit, or its successors or assigns, shall
dismantle and remove such wireless telecommunications facilities, and
all associated structures and facilities, from the site and restore the site
to as close to its original condition as is possible, such restoration being
limited only by physical or commercial impracticability, within 90 days
of receipt of written notice from the City. However, if the owner of the
property upon which the wireless telecommunications facilities are
located wishes to retain any access roadway to the wireless
telecommunications facilities, the owner may do so with the approval of

or complete. However, the burden of proving the need for the requested
relief, waiver or exemption is solely on the applicant. The applicant shall
bear all costs of the City in considering the request and the relief, waiver
or exemption. No such relief or exemption shall be approved unless the
applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, if granted,
the relief, waiver or exemption will have no significant effect on the health,
safety and welfare of the City, its residents and other service providers.

received notice, then the City may order officials or representatives of
the City to remove the wireless telecommunications facilities at the sole
expense of the owner or special use permit holder.
E. If the City removes, or causes to be removed, wireless
telecommunications facilities and the owner of the wireless
telecommunications facilities does not claim and remove them from the
site to a lawful location within 10 days, then the City may take steps to
declare the wireless telecommunications facilities abandoned and sell
them and their components.
F. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the City may
approve a temporary use permit/agreement for the wireless
telecommunications facilities for no more 90 days, during which time a
suitable plan for removal, conversion, or relocation of the affected
wireless telecommunications facilities shall be developed by the holder
of the special use permit, subject to the approval of the City, and an
agreement to such plan shall be executed by the holder of the special

executed within the ninety-day time period, then the City may take
possession of and dispose of the affected wireless telecommunications
facilities in the manner provided in this section.

Junked Cars
§ 300-1. Legislative finding and intent.
The outdoor storage of junked, discarded and unlicensed motor vehicles
on privately owned property within the City of Hudson is detrimental to
the health, safety and general welfare of the community. The same also
constitutes an attractive nuisance to children and in many ways imperils
their safety. Such storage also endangers the person and property of
members of the community since fuel tanks containing gasoline or gasoline
fumes may easily explode. Such storage is unsightly and depreciates
property values. The outdoor storage of abandoned, junked, discarded and
unlicensed motor vehicles on privately owned properties within the City of
Hudson is therefore regulated for the preservation of the health, safety and
general welfare of the community.

including a trailer, lacking a current registration plat and which has been
abandoned, junked, discarded, dismantled (in whole or in part) or is in a
rusted or wrecked condition or which is not in condition for legal use upon
the highways.
MOTOR VEHICLE  Every vehicle originally designed and intended to be
operated, drawn or driven, or capable of being operated, drawn or driven,
upon a public highway by any power other than muscular power. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term motor vehicle shall include, but not be
limited to, automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles and trailers.
OWNER OF MOTOR VEHICLE  A person, firm or corporation having
property in or title to a motor vehicle, including a person entitled to the use
and possession of a vehicle subject to a security interest in another person,
and also including any lessee or bailee of a motor vehicle having the use
thereof under lease or otherwise.
OWNER OF PRIVATE PROPERTY  A person, firm or corporation who is the
owner, contract purchaser, tenant, lessee, occupant, undertenant, receiver
or assignee of private premises or private property located within the City
of Hudson.

building; or
B. Such motor vehicle is the inventory or part of the inventory of a new or
used motor vehicle dealer located on the premises in compliance with

hereof. These uses are subject to the regulations specified below and
elsewhere in this chapter. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(1) Professional, governmental or business offices and office buildings,
including customary accessory uses thereto, as permitted and
regulated in Multiple Residence-Conditional Office R-3 District,
§ 325-10B(3).
(2) Eating and drinking places.
(3) Retail stores and banks.
D. Permitted accessory uses.
(1) Customary and accessory uses as permitted and regulated in the
One-Family Residence R-1 District, § 325-7C.
(2) Customary and accessory uses related thereto, as permitted and
regulated in the Central Commercial C-C District, § 325-14C.
E. Mixed-use development. Residential and conditional uses, and any
accessory uses permitted thereto, authorized in the Riverfront Gateway
R-G District, may exist together, upon one lot, subject to the approval of
the Planning Board in accordance with Article VIII hereof. These uses
are subject to the regulations specified below and elsewhere in this
chapter. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(1) Except for the ground floor, no floor in any building having a mix of
residential and conditional uses may be used for both dwellings and
§ 325-17.4 HUDSON CODE § 325-17.4
318:672
conditional uses unless two separate entrances, including hallways,
are provided, giving direct access to each use.
(2) Where a residential use and a conditional use are proposed on the
same lot, in addition to the provisions of Article VIII, the Planning
Board may impose additional conditions on such mixed-use
development as may be necessary to protect the public health,
safety and welfare of residents living on the same lot or in close
proximity to conditional uses. Such additional conditions may
include, but are not limited to, regulation of noise, lighting and
visual impacts associated with the operation of such conditional
uses.
F. Inclusionary zoning. In order to ensure an economically diverse housing
stock in the R-G District, the development or redevelopment of any
multiple dwelling, multiple-family dwelling, or the subdivision of a
parcel resulting in 10 or more dwelling units shall only be developed or
redeveloped as set forth in this subsection. For purposes of this
subsection, the term "redevelopment" means any activity related to a
building or structure for which the issuance of a building permit would
be necessary pursuant to § 325-30.
(1) Affordable housing set aside. At least 20% of the total number of
dwelling units must be set aside and affordable as "low-income
housing" or "moderate-income housing" as those terms are defined
in § 325-42, whereupon the Planning Board shall grant a density
bonus to the owner or developer of such parcel of no greater than
30% as provided for in § 325-28.2G(1)(a) through (e), (2) and (3).
[Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(2) Notwithstanding § 325-17.4F(1) and § 325-28.2G, where the
Planning Board determines, due to the unique physical
characteristics of a parcel (for purposes of this subsection, referred
to as the "transferring parcel"), that approving a density bonus
commensurate with the affordable housing setaside would cause
extreme financial hardship to the owner or developer, or that
increasing the transferring parcel density to accommodate the
bonus would be impossible due to such unique physical
characteristics, the Planning Board may authorize the transfer of
the density bonus from the transferring parcel to another parcel, to
be known as the "receiving parcel," located within the LWRA,
provided that at least 25% of the affordable housing setaside
dwelling units are developed on the transferring parcel.
[Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(3) At least half of the affordable housing setaside dwelling units must
be affordable as low-income housing. Such determination shall be
made according to the following procedure:
(a) A property owner may request preservation credit certificates
from the Planning Board. The Board shall calculate the total
§ 325-17.4 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-17.4
318:673
number of credits upon the real property within a designated
sending area using a development yield factor. Development
yield is established by multiplying the gross area of the parcel
by the relevant development yield factor for the sending
district. The development yield factor for all mapped sending
areas shall be one right per 43,560 square feet of unimproved
real property. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(b) Preservation credits may be used to increase the development
yields within receiving areas. In its determination of the total
development yield of a particular property upon which
development rights are to be applied, the Planning Board shall
consider the extent of natural features existing on the site,
including, but not limited to, water surfaces, freshwater
wetlands and slopes in excess of thirty-percent grade.
[Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(c) In the One-Family Residence (R-1) District and One- and Two-
Family Residence (R-2) District, Multiple Residence-
Conditional Office (R-3) District and General Commercial (G-C)
District with regard to detached dwellings, preservation
credits may be used to increase lot yield by one lot per 40,000
square feet after subtracting for that land area required for
infrastructure and public improvements.
(d) In the Multiple Residence-Conditional Office (R-3) and Three-
Story Multiple Residence (R-4) Districts with regard to
attached dwellings and multiple dwelling units, preservation
credits may be used to increase the dwelling unit density at a
rate of one dwelling unit per preservation credit redeemed, not
to exceed four dwelling units per 40,000 square feet.
(e) In the Central Commercial (C-C) District and the General
Commercial (G-C) District, preservation credits may be used to
increase the allowable development yield at a rate of an
additional 1,500 square feet of floor area per preservation
credit redeemed to a maximum 0.3 floor area ratio.
(f) In the Industrial (I-1) District, preservation credits may be
used to increase the development yield at a rate of an
additional 1,500 square feet of floor area per preservation
credit redeemed to a maximum 0.3 floor area ratio.

District Bulk and Parking Regulations
§ 325-18. Schedule of Bulk and Area Regulations; density
calculation.152
A. Schedule of Bulk and Area Regulations. There is hereby established, at
the end of this chapter, a Schedule of Bulk and Area Regulations for all
zoning districts. Such schedule sets forth regulations applicable to the
following area and use dimensions of a parcel: the area of lots; the
heights of buildings; the yards and open spaces to be provided; the
minimum floor area ratio; and required off-street parking spaces.
Additional off-street loading and parking requirements are contained in
Article IV; alternative area or use dimensions and additional
regulations, including those related to conservation development and
incentive zoning, are contained in Article V.
B. Schedule applicability. In accordance with Article VIII, subdivision or
site plan approval must be in conformity with the Schedule of Bulk and
Area Regulations and/or, in the alternative where applicable, the
provisions of Article V relating to conservation development and
incentive zoning.
C. Density and net parcel size. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No.
2-2014]
(1) To calculate the density of a parcel and therefore the number of
potential lots into which such parcel may be subdivided, if any, the
applicant shall prepare and submit to the Planning Board a
proposed subdivision plat showing roads, recreation areas, lots
meeting the minimum lot size and setback requirements. From that
subdivision plat, the Planning Board must determine the net parcel
size by subtracting from the gross (total) parcel:
(a) State-designated wetlands requiring issuance of a state
wetland permit prior to alteration or use or wetlands that meet
the criteria for classification as federal jurisdictional wetlands;
(b) Land having slopes greater than 30%; and
(c) Land subject to an easement or right-of-way, or road, unless
the applicant has secured and submitted to the Planning Board
all necessary permits or approvals that would allow
development in those areas.
(2) Density shall be determined by applying the area and use
dimensions, set forth in the Schedule of Bulk and Area Regulations,
to the net parcel size. As a result of features unique to a parcel or
152. Editor's Note: The Schedule of Bulk and Area Regulations for Residential Districts and the
Schedule of Bulk and Area Regulations for Commercial and Industrial Districts are
included at the end of this chapter.

lot, the Planning Board may, through site plan or subdivision
review, reduce density below the density otherwise permissible
according to the application of the Schedule of Bulk and Area
regulations to the net parcel size, as the Planning Board deems
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
A. Permitted accessory parking. Off-street parking spaces, open or
enclosed, are permitted accessory to any use. In any residence district
one commercial vehicle with no more than one-ton capacity may be
parked, provided it belongs to residents therein and is not parked
between the street line and the principal building.
B. Required off-street parking spaces. Parcels of real property to be
developed within the City of Hudson shall not be required to establish a
minimum number of accessory off-street parking spaces. [Amended
2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014; 6-18-2019 by L.L. No. 2-2019]
C. Areas computed as parking spaces. Areas which may be computed as
open or enclosed off-street parking spaces include any private garage,
carport or other area available for parking, other than a street or a
driveway. However, a driveway within a required front yard for a one- or
two-family residence may count as one parking space, other than on a
corner lot as provided in § 325-22C.
D. Location and ownership of required accessory parking facilities.
Required accessory parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be provided
upon the same lot as the use to which they are accessory, or elsewhere,
provided all spaces therein are located within 300 feet, walking
distance, of such lot. In all cases such parking spaces shall conform to
all the regulations of the district in which they are located; and in no
event shall such parking spaces be located in any residence district
unless the uses to which they are accessory are permitted in such
district, or by special permission of the Zoning Board of Appeals. All
such spaces shall be in the same ownership as the use to which they are
accessory and shall be subject to deed restriction, approved by the
Planning Board and filed with the County Clerk, binding the owner and
his heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of spaces
available either throughout the existence of such use to which they are
accessory or until such spaces are provided elsewhere. [Amended
4-20-2004 by L.L. No. 3-2004; 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
E. Size of spaces. A parking space shall be 10 feet wide and 20 feet long,
exclusive of standing area and aisles for maneuvering. Entrance and
exit roadways shall not be computed as parking spaces except for onefamily
and two-family residences as in § 325-19C. Overall area per
parking space shall be computed at 300 square feet.
§ 325-18 HUDSON CODE § 325-19
318:676
F. Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided.
Such access shall consist of at least one ten-foot lane for parking areas
with 20 spaces or more.
G. Drainage and surfacing. All open parking areas shall be properly
drained and all such areas shall be provided with a dustless surface,
except for parking spaces accessory to a one-family or two-family
residence.
H. Joint facilities. Required parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be
provided in areas designed to serve jointly two or more establishments,
whether or not located on the same lot, provided that the number of
required spaces in such joint facilities shall be not less than the total
required for all such establishments.
I. Combined spaces. When any lot contains two or more uses having
different parking requirements, the parking requirements for each use
shall apply to the extent of that use. Where it can be conclusively
demonstrated that one or more such uses will be generating a demand
for parking spaces primarily during periods when other use or uses is
not or are not in operation, the Planning Board may reduce the total
parking spaces required for the use with the least requirement.
[Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
J. Screening. Where required off-street parking areas of over 10 spaces
are coincident with or lie within 25 feet of street or property lines,
suitable screening shall be required as approved by the Planning Board.
[Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
K. Parking spaces in Multiple Residence R-3 and R-4 Districts. In R-3 and
R-4 Districts, wherever space is provided for parking of 10 or more
vehicles in the open, such spaces shall be individually identified by
means of pavement markings and shall be screened as required by the
Planning Board. No parking space shall be located in any front yard or
within three feet of any lot line in side or rear yards. The parking of
motor vehicles within 15 feet of any wall or portion thereof of a threeor-
more-family dwelling, which wall contains windows (other than
bathroom or kitchen windows) with a sill height of less than eight feet
above the level of the parking space, is prohibited. No service of any
kind shall be permitted to be extended to users of the lot, including
automobile service, repair or fueling, and no gasoline, oil, grease or
other supplies shall be stored or sold in any such lot or in any garage on
such lot. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
L. Parking spaces adjacent to residence districts.
(1) Wherever a parking lot abuts the side or rear lot line of a lot in a
residence district or is located across the street from any residence
district, the parking lot shall be screened as required by the
Planning Board. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]

D. Joint facilities. Permitted or required loading berths, open or enclosed,
may be provided in spaces designed to serve jointly two or more
adjacent establishments, provided that the number of required berths
in such joint facilities shall not be less than the total required for all
such establishments.
A. Access near street corners. No entrance or exit for any accessory offstreet
parking area with over 10 parking spaces, nor any loading berth,
shall be located within 50 feet of the intersection of any two street lines.
B. On lots divided by district boundaries. When a use is located on a lot
which is partly in one district and partly in another district, the
regulations for the district requiring the greater number of parking
spaces or loading berths shall apply to all of the lot. Parking spaces or
loading berths on such a lot may be located without regard to district
lines, provided that no such parking spaces or loading berths shall be
located in any residence district unless the use to which they are
accessory is permitted in such district, or upon approval by the
Planning Board. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
C. Driveways. No driveway shall provide access to a lot located in another
district, which lot is used for any use prohibited in the district in which

318:685
§ 325-27. Prohibited uses in all districts.
The following uses are prohibited in all districts:
§ 325-28. Conservation development. [Added 8-21-1984 by L.L. No.
5-1984; amended 9-17-1985 by L.L. No. 3-1985; 4-20-2004 by L.L.
No. 3-2004; 11-30-2011 by L.L. No. 5-2011]
has been discontinued for any reason for a period of over one year
or has been changed to or replaced by a conforming use, such use
shall be subject to the provisions of this § 325-26.
A. Any trade, industry, process or use which is noxious, offensive or
objectionable by reason of the emission of smoke, dust, gas, odor or
other form of air pollution or by reason of the deposit, discharge or
dispersal of liquid or solid wastes in any form in a manner or amount as
to cause permanent damage to the soil and streams or to adversely
affect the surrounding area, or by reason of the creation of noise,
vibration, electromagnetic or other disturbance, or by reason of
illumination by artificial light or light reflection beyond the limits of the
lot on or from which such light or light reflection emanates, or which
involves any dangerous fire, explosive, radioactive or other hazard, or
which causes injury, annoyance or disturbance to any of the
surrounding properties or to their owners and occupants, and any other

by L.L. No. 4-2013]
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the health and
general welfare of the City of Hudson by preserving open space,
providing recreational opportunities, protecting natural resources,
preserving scenic views, particularly views of the Catskill Mountains
and the Hudson River, and reducing infrastructure and related
maintenance costs associated with reducing the width or length of
streets and reducing the distance over which utilities must be extended
by encouraging flexibility of design and development of land in such a
manner as to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open lands.
B. Applicability; subdivision of parent parcel.
§ 325-26 HUDSON CODE § 325-28
318:686
(1) Conservation development is authorized and may be utilized as
provided for in this section in any residential district or district
authorizing residential uses.
(2) Notwithstanding Subsection B(1) of this section, conservation
development is required in the Institutional-Residential
Conservation I-R-C District for the subdivision of three or more
parcels or lots.
(3) An applicant may not subdivide a parcel in segments in such a
manner as to avoid the requirement of Subsection B(2) or to
circumvent the restrictions on segmentation set forth in the State
Environmental Quality Review Act. The number of permissible
subdivisions shall be based upon the parent parcel size as defined
by § 325-35.1.
C. Conditions of conservation development approval. In order to promote
the purposes of this section, the Planning Board may, in a residential
district, a district authorizing residential use or the Institutional-
Residential Conservation I-R-C District, authorize development of a
conservation development by granting the right to vary the parcel or lot
site dimensions, including bulk, area, lot size, setback requirements,
height, and size of a residential or congregate care dwelling unit
subject to imposition of the following conditions and findings by the
Planning Board: [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(1) Density. The proposed conservation development must result in a
total density no greater than the density otherwise permissible
pursuant to § 325-18. Therefore, where a conservation
development is proposed on a parcel having a total parcel size of 30
acres and a net parcel size of 20 acres in a district zoned for one
dwelling unit per 1/8 acre, the maximum possible total density
[prior to a determination of the conserved land set aside as per
§ 325-28C(2)], pursuant to § 325-18, for such parcel would be 160
dwelling units situated on 20 acres.
(2) Conservation land setaside. Not less than 50% of the net parcel
size, as defined by § 325-18C, must be set aside and maintained as
permanent conservation land as provided for in § 325-28D. For
purposes of calculating the conservation land, privately owned
open space areas or conservation areas associated with and within
50 feet of a dwelling or congregate care unit are considered not to
have conservation value and may not be included as conserved land
or open space. Where the net parcel size is 10 acres or less, the
conservation-land-setaside calculation may include up to 25% of
the net parcel [i.e., any land on the parcel described in
§ 325-18C(1) to (3)]. Therefore, in a district zoned for one dwelling
unit per 1/8 acre, where the gross parcel size is 20 acres, the net
parcel size is 10 acres and a twenty-five-percent conservation land
allowance is applied; the maximum possible density for such parcel
§ 325-28 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-28
318:687
would be 80 dwelling units situated on 12.5 acres, with 7.5 acres
reserved as conservation land.
(3) Conservation land value. Only land having conservation value shall
be eligible to be included in a conservation easement or deed
covenant. Land having conservation value shall include, but not be
limited to:
(a) Land with scenic viewsheds or located in scenic view corridors,
especially those encompassing the Catskill Mountains or the
Hudson River, and all scenic views identified in the LWRP;
(b) Land encompassing or adjacent to park and recreation land,
biking or pedestrian trails, unfragmented forestland, mature
forests, wildlife corridors and habitats, water bodies, stream
corridors, greenways, unique geological features, open space
areas, historic and archaeological sites, ridgelines, and steep
slopes;
(c) Critical environmental areas as defined by a local agency or
state agency pursuant to the State Environmental Quality
Review Act; or
(d) Lands included in a conservation land allowance as set forth in
§ 325-18C(2).
(4) Development design. Lots shall be arranged in a manner that
protects conservation land, minimizes habitat fragmentation, and
facilitates pedestrian and bicycle circulation. The design of the
development shall provide for the grouping or clustering of
dwelling or congregate care unit or units so that each cluster is set
off from the others and/or from adjacent property by intervening
open space with the intention of permanently preserving the
undeveloped land and of permanently preserving as much of the
existing foliage as possible, especially around the perimeter of the
site. Visual privacy shall be preserved for residents through the
proper design of rear yards and/or patio spaces. Proper screening
through the use of vegetation, fencing partially or fully enclosed
patios shall be provided. The development design shall also utilize
the least amount of impervious road surface as is practically
possible. Any development shall not compromise the conserved
land or diminish its conservation value. Where possible,
development should occur on land that has been disturbed or
altered in the past. For purposes of this section, land disturbed or
altered in the past does not include land disturbed by an applicant
within two years prior to applying for conservation development
approval.
(5) Alteration of lot dimensions. Appropriate minimum yard setbacks,
bulk and areas requirements and other parcel or lot dimensions in
a conservation subdivision will depend upon the lot sizes, the type
of road frontage (state, county, City or private) and the character of
§ 325-28 HUDSON CODE § 325-28
318:688
the surrounding community and the proposed conservation
subdivision. Where height restrictions are varied within the Local
Waterfront Revitalization Area, the height of any structure shall not
obstruct any scenic views identified in the LWRP. In no instance
may the height of any structure in a conservation development
exceed four stories or 45 feet, whichever is less. Yard requirements
and other lot dimensions shall be established at the time of
subdivision plat approval and shall be included on the plat.
(6) Public sewer and water. Each lot in a conservation development
must be served by public water supply and sewer systems.
(7) Notations on plat or site plan. Preserved conservation land shall be
clearly delineated and labeled on the final subdivision plat or site
plan as to its use, ownership, management, method of preservation
and the rights, if any, of the owners of other lots in the subdivision
to such land. The plat or site plan shall clearly show that the
conservation land is permanently reserved for open space purposes
and shall contain a notation indicating the deed reference of any
conservation easement or deed covenant required to be filed to
implement such restrictions pursuant to § 325-28D.
D. Conservation easements and deed restrictions. Conserved land or open
space areas in a conservation subdivision shall be permanently
preserved by a conservation easement or deed covenant, or such other
land agreement as may be approved by the Common Council in
consultation with the City Attorney, which permanently conserves the
conservation land area. Such conservation easement or covenant shall
be approved by the Planning Board prior to filing with the County
Recorder and shall be required as a condition of approval. Further, such
easement or covenant shall be recorded with the County Recorder prior
to or simultaneously with the filing of the final subdivision plat in the
County Clerk's office. Pursuant to § 247 of the General Municipal Law
and/or Article 49 of the Environmental Conservation Law, conservation
easements shall be granted to the City, with the approval of the
Common Council, or to a qualified not-for-profit conservation
organization or homeowners' association acceptable to the Planning
Board. The Planning Board may require that the conservation easement
be enforceable by the City if the City is not the holder of the
conservation easement. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
E. Ownership of conservation land. Unless the developer of the
conservation development retains ownership of conservation land of
four or more acres, such land shall be conveyed as follows:
(1) To the City of Hudson, subject to approval by the Common Council;
(2) To a nonprofit organization whose principal purpose is the
conservation of open space;
§ 325-28 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-28
318:689
(3) To a hospital, sanitarium, philanthropic or eleemosynary
institution, convalescent or nursing home or home for the aged
which owns the cluster development; or
(4) To a homeowners' association (HOH) or in such other form of
private ownership as the Planning Board finds adequate to properly
manage and protect the conservation value of the conserved or
open space land. Such HOH or other organization or form of
ownership interest shall be subject to the following conditions:
[Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(a) The HOH, other organization or other form of ownership
interest must be established prior to final subdivision plat
approval and must comply with all applicable provisions of the
General Business Law.
(b) Every deed to or lease of a dwelling unit constructed pursuant
to this article shall contain a covenant or provision mandating
that all conserved land shall be maintained by the owners or
lessees of such dwelling units. It shall be a condition to the
final approval of any such site plan that each such deed or
lease will be recorded at the Columbia County Clerk's office
within 10 days after its execution, and the form of such consent
or provision must be approved by the City Attorney prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(c) Membership in the association must be mandatory for each
property owner within the subdivision and for every successive
property owner, who must be required by recorded covenant to
pay fees to the HOH for taxes, insurance and maintenance for
common open space, private roads or other common facilities.
(d) The ownership of conserved land areas shall be divided among
all owners of building lots within a conservation development
in order to provide that all residents in such development shall
have access at all times onto land in the development on which
no structures are erected, except for private lots in single
ownership associated with individual dwelling units and except
that the roads or other open lands in the development may,
with the approval of the Planning Board and consent of the
City, be dedicated to the City.
(e) All restrictions on the ownership, use and maintenance of
conserved land areas must be permanent and shall pass with
the conveyance of the lots or dwelling units.
(f) The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes, and the maintenance of the conserved land areas,
including any active recreation areas and related facilities.
(g) Each lot owner within the subdivision shall be made
responsible for paying his proportionate share of the
§ 325-28 HUDSON CODE § 325-28
318:690
association's costs, and the assessment levied by the
association shall become a lien on the property if not paid.
(h) The association shall have the power to adjust assessments to
meet changing needs.
(i) In the event that the maintenance, preservation and/or use of
the conserved land area(s) ceases to be in compliance with any
of the above requirements or any other requirement specified
by the Planning Board when approving the subdivision plat, the
City shall be granted the right to take all necessary action to
assure such compliance and to assess against the association
and/or each individual property owner within the subdivision
all costs incurred by the City for such purposes, including the
payment of property taxes on the conserved land area(s).
(j) The City Attorney shall make a determination that any
documents necessary to comply with or demonstrate
compliance with Subsection D(a) to (i) are legally sufficient and
enforceable as necessary to carry out the intent of this
subsection.
F. Permitted uses of conserved land areas. Conserved land or open space
areas shall be preserved in their natural state wherever possible, and
the uses of such areas shall be limited to appropriate conservation,
open space and recreation purposes as determined by the Planning
Board and further defined below. A portion of the conserved land
areas(s) may be designated "active recreation areas" on the subdivision
plat, in a location approved by the Planning Board. Active recreation
shall include but not be limited to playgrounds, swimming pools, biking
trails, tennis courts, and accessory buildings thereto. Such active
recreation area and uses, including any accessory buildings, shall not
exceed 20% of the total conserved land area and shall not degrade the
conservation value of the conserved lands. Where deemed appropriate,
the Planning Board may specify a phased construction schedule for
structures and facilities associated with active recreation. Enlargement
of such structures and facilities not shown on the filed plat shall be
subject to the approval of the Planning Board. [Amended 2-18-2014
by L.L. No. 2-2014]
G. Maintenance. As a condition of subdivision approval, final plat approval
shall include ongoing maintenance standards to preserve and protect
the conserved land. Such standards shall be enforceable by the City
against the owner of the conserved land to ensure that the conserved
land is not used for storage or the dumping of refuse, junk or other
offensive or hazardous materials. If the failure to maintain the
conserved land results in the creation of a public nuisance, the City
may, upon 30 days' written notice to the owner, enter the conserved
lands for necessary maintenance, and the cost of such maintenance by
the City shall be assessed ratably against the landowner or, in the case
§ 325-28 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-28
318:691
§ 325-28.1. Adult entertainment establishments. [Added 9-16-2008
by L.L. No. 6-2008]
of an HOH, the owners of the properties within the development. Such
costs shall, if unpaid, become a tax lien on such property or properties.
H. Approval procedure, notice and public hearing. Conservation
subdivision developments shall be subject to the subdivision approval
process as set forth in § 325-35.1. In addition, conservation
developments shall be subject to review at a public hearing. Such public
hearing shall be incorporated into the subdivision approval process set
forth in § 325-35.1 and, whenever practical, shall be incorporated into a
hearing held, if any, pursuant to the State Environmental Quality
Review Act.

benefits or amenities set forth in § 325-28.2E, the Planning Board may
award density bonuses by increasing the density of the underlying
zoning district up to a maximum of 20% in proportion to the degree to
which the proposed community benefit or amenity confers to the public
a benefit. An additional ten-percent bonus may be awarded for the
provision of affordable housing as provided for in § 325-28.2G. In
awarding a density bonus, the Planning Board shall: [Amended
2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(1) Make a written determination setting forth specific findings stating
how such community benefits or amenities further the purposes of
the Comprehensive Plan and the LWRP and the rationale justifying
the amount of the density bonus authorized in proportion to the
community benefit or amenity provided.
(2) Require, as a condition of issuing a density bonus permit, the
execution of a memorandum of understanding prepared to the
satisfaction of the City Attorney, between the applicant and the
City. Such memorandum shall be legally enforceable, subject to the
approval of the Common Council and, at a minimum, contain the
following provisions:
(a) In the case of a density bonus awarded for the provision of
affordable housing for low- or moderate-income individuals or
families, certification of compliance with all provisions of
§ 325-28.2E(1).
(b) In the case of a density bonus awarded for the provision of
conservation land pursuant to § 325-28.2E(2), certification of
compliance with all applicable provisions of § 325-28.
(c) In the case of a density bonus awarded for the provision of
public access pursuant to § 325-28.2E(3) and (4), a
requirement that such access be provided in perpetuity and
that provision be made for future maintenance. Easements or
other means of providing legal public access shall be included
on the deed of the subservient property and recorded in the
Columbia County Clerk's office.
(d) In the case of a density bonus awarded for the protection and/
or rehabilitation of historic buildings as provided for in
§ 325-28.2 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-28.2

by a licensed architect documenting the restoration or
rehabilitation efforts undertaken, a certificate of
appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Commission,
and a copy of any approvals, if necessary, from the New York
State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
(3) Except for affordable housing bonuses granted pursuant to
§ 325-28.2G, a developer may transfer a density bonus awarded for
benefits or amenities listed in § 325-28.2E(2) to (5) to another
parcel within the LWRA.
G. Affordable housing bonus.
(1) In order to encourage an economically diverse housing stock in the
LWRA, the Planning Board may grant a density permit and award a
density bonus where an applicant provides affordable housing to
low- or moderate-income residents under the following conditions:
[Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
(a) Term of agreement. Affordable housing must remain affordable
for 40 years except as provided for in § 325-28.2G(2).
(b) Lease agreements. Lease agreements associated with
affordable housing rental units must place a renter on notice
that such units are subject to the provisions of this law.
(c) Covenants and deed restrictions. Prior to issuance of any
residential building permits for parcels having been granted a
density bonus for owner-occupied low- or moderate-income
residential housing, the permit applicant shall execute, in a
form acceptable to the City Attorney, covenants and deed
restrictions that guarantee the affordability of each of the
designated affordable housing units for 40 years, as provided
in § 325-28.2G(1)(a), or in perpetuity, as provided for in
§ 325-28.2G(2). Such covenant and deed restrictions shall
include the initial maximum allowable sale price; the rate by
which subsequent sale prices may increase; the income and
assets limitations of the purchasers of each affordable housing
unit; and fair marketing and selection procedures. Such deed
restrictions or covenants must be filed with the Office of the
Clerk of Columbia County, New York.
(d) Property owners of affordable housing rental units must certify
annually that such units are occupied by residents eligible to
reside in either low- or moderate-income housing, as the case
may be, as those terms are defined in § 325-42. Such
certification must be filed with the Office of the Building
Inspector on such form as the Building Inspector may provide.
(e) Any affordable housing units created pursuant to this section
or § 325-17.4 shall have the same outward physical appearance
§ 325-28.2 HUDSON CODE § 325-28.2
318:698
as market rate housing units located on the same parcel or in
the same development.
(2) Notwithstanding § 325-28.2C(1), where affordable housing units
are provided for in perpetuity, the Planning Board may grant a
height variance of an additional one story above the otherwise
applicable height restriction. [Amended 2-18-2014 by L.L. No.
2-2014]
(3) Density bonuses provided for affordable housing are not
transferable to any property other than the property which is the
subject of the density bonus permit application.

not conform to the requirements set forth in this chapter:
A. Any type of nonconforming use of buildings or open land may be
continued indefinitely, but:

the lot or parcel of land occupied by such use on the effective date
of this chapter, nor shall any external evidence of such use be
increased by any means whatsoever.
(2) Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
(3) Shall not be reestablished if such use has for any reason been
discontinued for a period of over one year, or has been changed to
or replaced by a conforming use. Intent to resume a nonconforming
use shall not confer the right to do so.
B. Except as provided in § 325-29E, below, no building which houses such
a nonconforming use shall be:
(1) Structurally altered or enlarged; or
(2) Moved to another location where such use would be

C. If a building which houses a nonconforming use is destroyed
accidentally due to fire, explosion or other cause to an extent not
exceeding 50% of its true value, as determined by the City Tax Assessor,
such building may be restored within one year in substantially the same
size, form and location, and the same nonconforming use may be
reinstated without being extended. If destroyed to a greater extent,
such building may be restored but only to house a conforming use.
D. Any building (other than a sign), the use of which is in conformity with
the regulations set forth in this chapter, but which building does not
conform to one or more of the requirements hereof other than the use
requirements, may be altered, enlarged or rebuilt, provided that such
building shall not be altered, enlarged or rebuilt so as to increase the
degree of nonconformity thereof.
E. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance
and repair of any building or the carrying out, upon issuance of a
building permit, of major structural alterations or demolitions
necessary in the interest of public safety. In granting such a permit the
Building Inspector shall state the precise reason(s) why such
alterations were deemed necessary.

§ 325-34. Permits for conditional uses.
A. On application and after public notice and hearing, the Planning Board
may authorize the issuance by the Building Inspector of permits for any
of the conditional uses specified in this chapter. In approving any such
use, the Planning Board shall take into consideration the public health,
safety and welfare, the comfort and convenience of the public in
general and of the residents of the immediate neighborhood in
particular, and may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards as
may be required in order that the result of its action may, to the
maximum extent possible, further the expressed intent of this chapter
and the accomplishment of the following objectives in particular:
(1) That all proposed structures, equipment or material shall be readily
accessible for fire and police protection.
(2) That the proposed use shall be of such location, size and character
that, in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and
orderly development of the district in which it is proposed to be
situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of
adjacent properties in accordance with the zoning classification of
such properties.
(3) That, in addition to the above, in the case of any use located in or
directly adjacent to a residential district:
(a) The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith,
its site layout and its relation to access streets shall be such
that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use
and the assembly of persons in connection therewith will not
be hazardous or inconvenient to, or incongruous with, or
conflict with the normal traffic of the neighborhood.
(b) The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of
landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not
hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of
adjacent land and buildings.
B. Each application for a conditional use shall be accompanied by a
proposed plan, in duplicate, showing the size and location of the lot, the
location of all buildings and proposed facilities, including access drives,
parking areas and all streets within 200 feet of the lot.
§ 325-34 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-34
318:707
§ 325-35. Site development plan approval.
C. The Planning Board may require that conditional use permits be
periodically renewed. Such renewal shall be granted following public
notice and hearing, and may be withheld only upon a determination by
the Building Inspector to the effect that such conditions as may have
been prescribed by the Planning Board in conjunction with the issuance
of the original permit have not been or are being no longer complied
with. In such cases a period of 60 days shall be granted the applicant
for full compliance prior to the revocation of said permit.
A. Approval required; exception; certificate of occupancy.
(1) Approval required. No building permit shall be issued and no
change in use or intensity of use which will affect the
characteristics of the site in terms of parking, loading, access,
drainage or utilities shall be permitted except in conformity with an
approved site development plan issued in accordance with this
chapter. The following land uses shall always require issuance of
site development plan approval:
(a) All new commercial, industrial and institutional development
on a previously vacant lot or parcel.
(b) New residential development containing four or more units in
non-single-family structures on contiguous or adjacent lots
that have previously been subdivided.
(c) All expansions of existing commercial, industrial or residential
uses containing at least four dwelling units which increase the
ground floor area by at least 1,000 square feet or 25% of the
existing ground floor area.
(d) Any conversions of an existing residential structure to a
nonresidential or institutional use (excepting the
establishment of a home occupation that is a permitted use or
accessory use).
(e) All conversions of an existing nonresidential structure to a
residential use containing at least four dwelling units.
(2) Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing, site development plan
approval is not required for interior alterations or the erection or
enlargement of one-, two- or three-family residences or accessory
uses thereto.
(3) Certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy for a structure
or use subject to site development plan review shall be issued until
all the requirements for such approval and any conditions attached
thereto have been met. The continued validity of any certificate of
occupancy shall be subject to continued conformance with such
§ 325-34 HUDSON CODE § 325-35
318:708
approved plan and conditions. Revisions of such plans shall be
subject to the same approval procedure.
B. In all cases where an amendment of any such plan is proposed, the
applicant must also secure the approval of the amendment by the
Planning Board. No building permit may be issued for any building
within the purview of this section until an approved site development
plan or amendment of any such plan has been secured by the applicant
and presented to the Building Inspector. No certificate of occupancy
may be issued for any building or use of land within the purview of this
section unless the building is constructed or used, or the land is
developed or used, in conformity with an approved site development
plan or an amendment of any such plan. The Building Inspector shall
certify on each site development plan or amendment to a site
development plan whether or not the plan meets the requirements of
this chapter other than those enumerated in sections of this chapter
regarding site development plan approval.
C. Presubmission. Prior to the submission of a formal site development
plan, the applicant shall meet in person with the Planning Board and/or
its designated representative to discuss the proposed site development
plan in order to determine which of the requirements listed in
§ 325-35D shall be necessary in developing and submitting the required
development plan. Upon findings by the Planning Board that, due to
special conditions peculiar to a site, certain of the information normally
required as part of the site plan is inappropriate or unnecessary, or that
strict compliance with said requirements may cause extraordinary and
unnecessary hardships, the Board may vary or waive the provision of
such information, provided that such variance or waiver will not have
detrimental effects on the public health, safety or general welfare or
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the site plan
submission, Official Map, Comprehensive Plan or this chapter.
D. Required submissions. At least 15 days in advance of the Planning
Board meeting at which a site development plan or an amendment of it
is to be presented, the required information must be submitted to the
Secretary of the Planning Board in triplicate along with a letter of
application. All maps submitted must be at a scale of not less than 30
feet to the inch. The information to be submitted and which, in total,
constitutes a site development plan shall be as follows:

E. Additional data. Where, due to special conditions peculiar to a site, or
the size, nature or complexity of the proposed use or development of
land or buildings, the Planning Board finds that additional data are
necessary for proper review of the site development plan, the Board
may require such data to be included in the required submission of the
site development plan.
(1) Legal data. A copy of any covenants or deed restrictions that are
intended to cover all or any part of the tract.

security shall be provided to the City pursuant to the provisions of
Subdivision 8 of § 33 of Article 3 of the General City Law.
(2) Inspection of improvements. At least five days prior to commencing
construction of required improvements, the subdivider shall pay to

satisfactory completion of improvements and utilities required by
the Planning Board.
(3) Proper installation of improvements. If the required improvements

shall comply with the provisions of the State Environmental Quality
Review Act under Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law and
its implementing regulations. Wherever possible, the procedure and
requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act and the
site plan review process should be conducted and complied with

(b) Site layout (including location, power, direction and time of any
outdoor lighting of the site) which would have no significant
adverse impact upon any adjoining or nearby properties by
impairing the established character or the potential use of
properties in such districts. Any adverse impacts must be
mitigated to the maximum extent practicable.
(c) The reasonable screening, at all seasons of the year, of all
playgrounds, parking and service areas from view of the
adjacent residential properties and streets.
(d) Conformance of the proposed site development plan with the
City of Hudson Comprehensive Plan and, where applicable, the
Local Waterfront Revitalization Program, including any
applicable policies contained in the LWRP.
(e) In applicable cases, a drainage system and layout which would
afford the best solution to any drainage problem.

(i) Without restricting the permissible limits of the applicable
zoning district, the height, location, design and signage of each
building should be compatible with its site and the existing and
historic character of the surrounding neighborhood. Adaptive
reuse of existing structures is strongly encouraged.
(3) Public hearing and decision on complete site plan application.
(a) Hearing and notice. Except where the application includes a
density bonus request, the Planning Board may, at its
discretion, convene a public hearing for the purpose of
accepting public comment on the proposed site plan or site
plan amendment application. In deciding whether to convene a
public hearing, the Planning Board shall consider the level of
public interest in and desire for a public hearing and the
potential for the proposed plan or amendment to adversely
impact the public's health, safety or welfare. If the application
includes a request for a density bonus, the Planning Board
shall hold a public hearing. Where the Board convenes a public
hearing, such hearing shall be held within 62 days from the day
a completed application is submitted to the Secretary of the
Planning Board. Notice of such public hearing shall be sent to
the applicant by mail at least 10 days before said hearing, and
public notice of said hearing shall be provided in a newspaper
of general circulation in the City at least five days prior to the
date of the hearing. Notice shall also be provided to the County
Planning Commission of such hearing where necessary as
required by § 239-m of the General Municipal Law and to
"neighboring municipalities" as defined and required by
§ 239-nn of the General Municipal Law.
(b) Timing of decision. The Board shall grant, deny, or grant
subject to conditions such site plan application within 62 days
after close of such hearing or after the day the complete
application is received if no hearing is held. The time within
which the Planning Board must render its decision may be
extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the Board. If a
public hearing is held pursuant to the State Environmental
Quality Review Act on a draft environmental impact statement,
public hearings must be held jointly in accordance with the
State Environmental Quality Review Act and regulations
adopted pursuant thereto. For any unlisted or Type I action
under the State Environmental Quality Review Act, no
application hereunder shall be deemed complete until a
negative declaration or notice of completion of a draft
environmental impact statement has been filed in accordance
with the provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review
Act.
(4) Filing with the City Clerk. The Planning Board's decision shall be
filed in the office of the City Clerk within five business days after
§ 325-35 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-35

§ 325-35.1. Subdivision approval.
Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed to be made, including a
conservation subdivision, and before any contract for the sale of or any offer
to sell any lots in such subdivision or any part thereof is made, and before
any permit for the erection of a structure in such proposed subdivision shall
be granted, the owner or his duly authorized agent shall apply in writing, by
submission of a subdivision application and all other necessary materials,
for approval of such proposed subdivision. For purposes of this chapter, the
number of parcel subdivisions shall be calculated based upon the "parent
parcel" as that term is defined in § 325-42. Accordingly, the number of
permissible subdivisions shall be calculated based upon the parent parcel
as follows: Lots which have been created from a parent parcel cannot be
further subdivided unless more than one lot assignment was made to the
parcel during the initial subdivision of the parent parcel. Therefore, if a onehundred-
acre parent parcel is subdivided into two lots, one with 40 acres
and one with 60 acres, and the original parent parcel was allowed eight lots,
the parent parcel landowner could stipulate, for example, that the fortyacre
parcel is given six lot assignments and the sixty-acre parcel is given
two lot assignments. In any case, the assignment of lots may not exceed the
maximum number of lots allowed for the original parent parcel. Subdivision
approval must be obtained in accordance with the following procedures:
such decision is rendered and a copy thereof mailed to the
applicant.
(5) Court review. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning
Board made pursuant to this section may bring a proceeding to
review such decision in the manner provided by Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules in a court of record of competent
jurisdiction on the ground that such decision is illegal in whole or in
part. Such proceeding must be commenced within 30 days after the
filing of the decision in the office of the City Clerk.
A. Submission of sketch plan. Any owner of land shall, prior to subdividing
or resubdividing land, submit to the Secretary of the Planning Board at
least 10 days prior to the regular meeting of the Board seven copies of a
sketch plan of the proposed subdivision which shall comply with the
following provisions for the purpose of classifying the subdivision and
preliminary discussion of the application.
(1) The sketch plan initially submitted to the Planning Board shall be

C. Time for filing application. Within six months after acceptance and
classification of the sketch plan, the applicant shall submit to the
Planning Board an application for a subdivision approval for any major

approval of the design submitted on the preliminary plat as a
guide to the preparation of the final plat, which will be
submitted for approval of the Planning Board and for recording
upon fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations. Prior
§ 325-35.1 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-35.1

approval, the Planning Board shall, by resolution, either
conditionally approve, with or without modification,
disapprove, or grant final approval and authorize the signing
and certification of such final plat, within 62 days of its receipt
by the Planning Board. Failure of the Planning Board to act
within such time, unless such time period is extended by
mutual consent, shall constitute approval of such final plat.
(b) Form of final plat. The final plat for a major subdivision or
conservation development to be filed with the County Clerk
shall be printed upon linen or Mylar or upon such paper or
materials required by County Clerk of Columbia County to be

area of each lot.
(c) Underground utilities map. A map shall be submitted to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board, indicating the location of
the monuments marking all underground utilities as actually

on the final plat as follows:
§ 325-35.1 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-35.1
318:727
[i] If such commission determines that the
preparation of an environmental impact
statement on the final plat is not required, the
Planning Board shall, by resolution, conditionally
approve, with or without modification,
disapprove, or grant final approval and authorize
the signing of such plat within 62 days after the
date of the public hearing; or
[ii] If such Board determines that an environmental
impact statement is required and a public hearing
is held on the draft environmental impact
statement, the final environmental impact
statement shall be filed within 45 days following
the close of such public hearing in accordance
with the provisions of the State Environmental
Quality Review Act. If no public hearing is held on
the draft environmental impact statement, the
final environmental impact statement shall be
filed within 45 days following the close of the
public hearing on the final plat. Within 30 days of
the filing of the final environmental impact
statement, the Planning Board shall issue findings
on such final environmental impact statement and
shall, by resolution, conditionally approve, with or
without modification, disapprove, or grant final
approval and authorize the signing of such plat.
[d] Grounds for decision. The grounds for a modification,
if any, or the grounds for disapproval shall be stated
upon the records of the Planning Board.
[2] Planning Board not as lead agency; public hearing; notice;
decision.
[a] Public hearing. The Planning Board shall, with the
agreement of the lead agency, hold the public hearing
on the final plat jointly with the lead agency's hearing
on the draft environmental impact statement. Failing
such agreement or if no public hearing is held on the
draft environmental impact statement, the Planning
Board shall hold the public hearing on the plat within
62 days after the receipt of a complete final plat by the
Clerk of the Planning Board.

§ 325-35.1 HUDSON CODE § 325-35.1
318:728
Board may provide that the hearing be further
advertised in such manner as it deems most
appropriate for full public consideration of such final
plat. The hearing on the final plat shall be closed upon
motion of the Planning Board within 120 days after it
has been opened.
[c] Decision. The Planning Board shall, by resolution,
conditionally approve, with or without modification,
disapprove, or grant final approval and authorize the
signing of such plat as follows:
[i] If the preparation of an environmental impact
statement on the final plat is not required, the
Planning Board shall make its decision within 62
days after the close of the public hearing on such
final plat.
[ii] If an environmental impact statement is required,
the Planning Board shall make its own findings
and its decision on the final plat within 62 days
after the close of the public hearing on such final
plat or within 30 days of the adoption of findings
by the lead agency, whichever period is longer.
The grounds for a modification, if any, or the
grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the
records of the Planning Board.
(f) Plat certification. Upon passage of a resolution by the Planning
Board of conditional or final approval of the final plat, the
Planning Board shall empower a duly authorized officer to sign
the plat upon completion of such requirements as may be
stated in the resolution. Within five business days of such
resolution, the plat shall be certified by the Clerk of the
Planning Board as having been granted conditional or final
approval, and a copy of said plat shall be filed in the City
Clerk's office and mailed to the owner or applicant. In the case
of a conditionally approved plat, such resolution shall include a
statement of the requirements which, when completed, will
authorize the signing of the conditionally approved plat as
final. Upon completion of such requirements, the plat shall be
signed by the duly authorized officer of the Planning Board and
a copy of the signed plat shall be filed in the office of the City
Clerk.
(g) Approval of plat in sections. In granting conditional or final
approval of a plat in final form, the Planning Board may permit
the plat to be subdivided and developed in two or more
sections and may, in its resolution granting conditional or final
approval, state that such requirements as it deems necessary
to ensure the orderly development of the plat be accepted
§ 325-35.1 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-35.1
318:729
before the sections may be signed by the duly authorized
officer of the Planning Board. Conditional or final approval of
the sections of the final plat may be granted concurrently with
conditional or final approval of the entire plat, subject to any
requirements imposed by the Planning Board.
(h) Conditional approval. Conditional approval of the final plat
shall expire within 180 days after passage of the resolution
granting such approval unless all requirements stated in such
resolution have been certified as completed. The Planning
Board may extend by not more than two additional periods of
90 days each the time in which a conditionally approved plat
must be submitted for signature if, in the Planning Board's
opinion, such extension is warranted by the particular
circumstances.
(9) Default approval of preliminary plat. Any default approval of
preliminary plat shall not avoid the need for final plat submission
and approval.
(10) Improvements and performance bond. Before the Planning Board
grants final approval of a subdivision plat, the owner or applicant
shall complete all improvements (including roads and highways) or
comply with the following procedure:
(a) Furnishing of performance bond or other security. As an
alternative to the installation of infrastructure and
improvements, as above provided, prior to Planning Board
approval, a performance bond or other security sufficient to
cover the full cost of the same, as estimated by the Planning
Board or a City department designated by the Planning Board
to make such estimate, where such departmental estimate is
deemed acceptable by the Planning Board, shall be furnished
to the City by the owner.
(b) Security where plat approved in sections. In the event that the
owner shall be authorized to file the approved plat in sections,
as provided in this section, approval of the plat may be granted
upon the installation of the required improvements in the
section of the plat filed in the office of the County Clerk or the
furnishing of security covering the costs of such improvements.
The owner shall not be permitted to begin construction of
buildings in any other section until such section has been filed
in the office of the County Clerk and the required
improvements have been installed in such section or a security
covering the cost of such improvements is provided.
(c) Form of security. Any such security must be provided pursuant
to a written security agreement with the City, approved by the
Common Council and also approved by the City Attorney as to
§ 325-35.1 HUDSON CODE § 325-35.1
318:730
form, sufficiency and manner of execution, and shall be limited
to:
[1] A performance bond issued by a bonding or surety
company;
[2] The deposit of funds in, or a certificate of deposit issued
by, a bank or trust company located and authorized to do
business in this state;
[3] An irrevocable letter of credit from a bank located and
authorized to do business in this state;
[4] Obligations of the United States of America; or
[5] Any obligations fully guaranteed as to interest and
principal by the United States of America, having a market
value at least equal to the full cost of such improvements.
If not delivered to the City, such security shall be held in a
City account at a bank or trust company.
(d) Term of security agreement. Any such performance bond or
security agreement shall run for a term to be fixed by the
Planning Board, but in no case for a longer term than three
years; provided, however, that the term of such performance
bond or security agreement may be extended by the Planning
Board with consent of the parties thereto. If the Planning
Board shall decide at any time during the term of the
performance bond or security agreement that the extent of
building development that has taken place in the subdivision is
not sufficient to warrant all the improvements covered by such
security or that the required improvements have been installed
as provided in this section and by the Planning Board in
sufficient amount to warrant reduction in the amount of said
security, and upon approval by the Common Council, the
Planning Board may modify its requirements for any or all such
improvements, and the amount of such security shall
thereupon be reduced by an appropriate amount so that the
new amount will cover the cost in full of the amended list of
improvements required by the Planning Board.
(e) Default of security agreement. In the event that any required
improvements have not been installed as provided in this
section within the term of such security agreement, the
Common Council may thereupon declare the said performance
bond or security agreement to be in default and collect the sum
remaining payable thereunder, and upon the receipt of the
proceeds thereof, the City shall install such improvements as
are covered by such security and as commensurate with the
extent of building development that has taken place in the
subdivision but not exceeding in cost the amount of such
proceeds.
§ 325-35.1 YARD AND GARAGE SALES § 325-35.1
318:731
(f) Extension of period specified in security agreement.
[1] The time period for the completion of all required
improvements, as set forth in the security agreement and
any renewals or replacements thereof, shall not be
extended except upon approval of the Planning Board.
Requests for an extension shall be addressed in writing to
the Planning Board and shall set forth the following
information:
[a] Detailed reasons for failure or inability to complete
the work within the time specified in the security
agreement.
[b] The amount of work which has been completed, as
certified by the applicant's engineer.
[c] The maximum estimated time required to complete
the remainder of the work.
[d] The terms of the security agreement.
[2] The Planning Board shall consider escalations in
construction costs and may require the amount of security/
bond to be increased to reflect the increased construction
costs.
(g) Reduction in security. Upon approval of the Common Council
and after due notice, the Planning Board may reduce the
required amount of the performance bond or other security
during its term if the Planning Board finds that sufficient
improvements have been installed to warrant such a reduction.
Requests for a reduction shall be made in writing to the
Planning Board and shall itemize the amount of required
improvements already completed and the amount of reduction
requested. The Planning Board shall forward such application
to the Common Council for its action.
(11) Filing of approved subdivision with county.
(a) Upon completion of the requirements of this section and
notation to that effect upon the subdivision plat, it shall be
deemed to have final approval and shall be properly signed by
the duly designated officer of the Planning Board and shall be
filed by the applicant or owner, together with the Underground
Utilities Map, and any related deed restrictions or covenants,
in the office of the County Clerk of Columbia County, New York.
The approval of any subdivision plat not so filed or recorded by
reasons of the failure of the owner or applicant to act within 62
days of the date upon which such plat is approved as final shall
lapse and shall require resubmission to the Planning Board for
restamping or review as a preliminary or final plat as the
§ 325-35.1 HUDSON CODE § 325-35.1
318:732
Planning Board determines, given the duration of such failure,
the reasons therefor, the performance of required
improvements and the applicability of intervening laws,
standards or requirements.
(b) No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be
made in any subdivision plat after approval has been given by
the Planning Board and signed and certified on the plat, unless
the said plat is resubmitted to the Planning Board and such
Board approves any modifications. In the event that any such
plat is recorded without complying with this requirement, the
same shall be considered null and void, and the City shall
institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records
of the County Clerk.
(12) Public roads; recreation areas.
(a) The approval of the Planning Board of a subdivision plat shall
not be deemed to constitute or be evidence of an acceptance by
the City of any road, easement, or other open space shown on
such plat.
(b) When a conservation easement, trail, park, playground or
other recreation area shall have been shown on a plat, the
approval of said plat shall not constitute an acceptance by the
City of such area. The Planning Board shall require the plat to
be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Planning
Board may also require the filing of a written agreement
between the applicant and the City covering future deed and
title dedication and provision for the cost of grading,
development, equipment, and maintenance of any such
recreation area.
G. Waivers. Where the Planning Board finds that, because of the special
circumstances of a particular subdivision or conservation development,
extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with this
chapter, the Planning Board shall have the authority to vary or modify
the application of any of the requirements herein, in the interest of
public health, safety and general welfare; provided, however, that any
such waiver by the Planning Board shall be preceded by
recommendations to, and concurrence by, the Common Council.
H. (Reserved)158
I. Court review. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Board
made pursuant to this section may bring a proceeding to review such
decision in the manner provided by Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules in a court of record of competent jurisdiction on the ground
that such decision is illegal in whole or in part. Such proceeding must

office of the City Clerk.
A. Coastal Consistency Review Board.
(1) The Coastal Consistency Review Board shall be responsible for
coordinating review of actions in the City's coastal area for
consistency with the LWRP and will advise, assist and make
consistency recommendations to other City agencies in the
implementation of the LWRP, its policies and projects, including
physical, legislative, regulatory, administrative and other actions
included in the program.

sources to finance projects under the LWRP.
(4) The Coastal Consistency Review Board shall perform other
functions regarding the coastal area and direct such actions or
projects as the Common Council may deem appropriate to
implement the LWRP.
B. LWRP consistency review of actions.
(1) Whenever a proposed action is located within the City's coastal
area, each City agency shall, prior to approving, funding or
undertaking the action, make a determination that it is consistent
with the LWRP policy standards summarized in Subsection B(8)
herein. No action in the coastal area shall be approved, funded or
undertaken by that agency without such a determination.
(2) Whenever an agency of the City receives an application for
approval or funding of an action, or as early as possible in the
agency's formulation of a direct action to be located in the coastal
area, the agency shall refer a copy of the completed CAF159 to the
Coastal Consistency Review Board within 10 days of its receipt and,
prior to making its determination, shall consider the
recommendation of the Coastal Consistency Review Board with
reference to the consistency of the proposed action.
159. Editor's Note: "CAF" refers to the coastal assessment form. Said form is on file in the City

318:734
(3) Coastal Consistency Review Board consideration;
recommendation.
(a) After referral from an agency, the Coastal Consistency Review
Board shall consider whether the proposed action is consistent
with the LWRP policy standards set forth in Subsection B(8)
herein. The Coastal Consistency Review Board shall require
the applicant to submit all completed applications, CAFs,
EAFs, and any other information deemed necessary to its
consistency recommendation.
(b) The Coastal Consistency Review Board shall render its written
recommendation to the agency within 30 days following
referral of the CAF from the agency, unless extended by mutual
agreement of the Coastal Consistency Review Board and the
applicant or, in the case of a direct action, the agency. The
Coastal Consistency Review Board's recommendation shall
indicate whether the proposed action is consistent with or
inconsistent with one or more of the LWRP policy standards
and shall elaborate in writing the basis for its opinion. The
Coastal Consistency Review Board shall, along with a
consistency recommendation, make any suggestions to the
agency concerning modification of the proposed action,
including the imposition of conditions, to make it consistent
with LWRP policy standards or to greater advance them.
(c) In the event that the Coastal Consistency Review Board's
recommendation is not forthcoming within the specified time,
the agency shall make its consistency decision without the
benefit of the Coastal Consistency Review Board's
recommendation.
(4) If an action requires approval of more than one City agency,
decisionmaking will be coordinated between the agencies to
determine which agency will conduct the final consistency review,
and that agency will thereafter act as designated consistency
review agency for the specific action being reviewed. Only one CAF
per action will be prepared. If the agencies cannot agree, the
Common Council shall designate the consistency review agency.
(5) Agency consideration; Zoning Board of Appeals.

written consistency recommendation of the Coastal
Consistency Review Board in the event and at the time it
makes a decision to grant such a variance and shall impose
appropriate conditions on the variance to make the activity
consistent with the objectives of this section.
(6) Where an EIS is being prepared or required, the draft EIS must
identify applicable LWRP policy standards in Subsection B(8) and
include a thorough discussion of the effects of the proposed action
on such policy standards.
(7) In the event the Coastal Consistency Review Board's
recommendation is that the action is inconsistent with the LWRP,
and the agency makes a contrary determination of consistency, the
agency shall elaborate in writing the basis for its disagreement
with the recommendation and state the manner and extent to
which the action is consistent with the LWRP policy standards.
(8) Actions to be undertaken within the coastal area shall be evaluated
for consistency in accordance with the following summary of LWRP
policy standards, which are derived from and further explained and

application before such board, including any required SEQRA review of
said application, or to obtain any other information deemed necessary
by such board for it to appropriately perform its duties. All such costs
related to such board's review, including studies, reports, analysis, legal

appeal, if insufficient funds remain in escrow to pay all such costs
remaining unpaid, the applicant or appellant shall, within 10 days of
receiving notice thereof from the Treasurer, make an additional
payment to the Treasurer in an amount equal to the amount by which
such unpaid costs exceed the amount of funds remaining in escrow, or if
after all costs have been paid, funds remain in escrow with respect to
such application or appeal, such remaining funds shall be disbursed to
the applicant or appellant within 10 days of the payment of all such
costs.
