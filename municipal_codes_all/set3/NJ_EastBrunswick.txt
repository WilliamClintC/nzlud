§ 3-76 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 3-78.1
1:80
A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this ordinance is to amend the East Brunswick
Municipal Code to provide for a Municipal Public Defender
Program in the Township of East Brunswick.
(2) Such a program is deemed in the best interests of the Township of
East Brunswick for the following reasons:
(a) Many defendants who appear in the East Brunswick Municipal
Court are indigent or of such limited means as to be unable to
afford to engage counsel;
(b) Both the State and Federal Constitutions guarantee persons
accused of serious offenses the right to the assistance of
counsel and require the State to provide counsel for such
defendants who cannot afford to engage counsel of their own;
(c) One way to assure representation for such persons in the East
Brunswick Municipal Court is by use of a Public Defender
engaged by the Township of East Brunswick, who can be
assigned by the Court to represent such persons;
(d) By providing for a Municipal Public Defender to ensure that
indigent persons are provided counsel, the Township of East
Brunswick will be promoting the interests of justice, helping to
assure expeditious disposition of cases before the East
Brunswick Municipal Court;
(e) As a means of defraying the costs for the services of a
Municipal Public Defender, N.J.S.A. 2B:24-17 authorizes the
collection of a $200 application fee in connection with the
appointment of counsel for indigent persons;
(f) By collecting the application fee authorized by N.J.S.A.
2B:24-17, the Township of East Brunswick will be reimbursed
for costs of providing the services of a Municipal Public
Defender.
B. Definitions relative to municipal public defenders. As used in this
Chapter 3-78.1:
(1) "Indigent defendant" means a person who is entitled to be
represented by a municipal public defender pursuant to this
Chapter 3-78.1, and does not have the present financial ability to
secure competent legal representation, as determined by Section
10 of this Chapter 3-78.1.
(2) "Municipal Court" means, unless herein specifically defined
otherwise, the East Brunswick Municipal Court.
(3) "Municipal public defender" means a person, as defined in Section
4 of this Chapter 3-78.1, appointed to represent indigent
§ 3-78.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 3-78.1
1:81
defendants in proceedings over which the municipal court has
jurisdiction.
(4) "Municipality" means, unless herein specifically defined otherwise,
the Township of East Brunswick.
C. Requirements for municipal public defenders. A municipal public
defender shall be an attorney-at-law of this State in good standing, and
shall serve for a term of one year from the date of his appointment, and
may continue to serve in office pending re-appointment or appointment
of a successor. A municipal public defender may be appointed to that
position in one or more municipal courts. The provisions of this Chapter
3-78.1 shall apply to each such position held. A municipal public
defender need not reside in the municipality where he acts as a
municipal public defender.
D. Autonomy of office. With the exception of the review procedure outlined
in Section 17, infra., the position of Municipal Public Defender shall be
independent from all departments and agencies of the Township
government, but, for purposes of budgeting and administration, shall be
allocated to the Department of Law.
E. Administration.
(1) Appointment of Municipal Public Defender.
(a) The Mayor shall nominate the Municipal Public Defender with
advice and consent of the Council.
(b) The Mayor may nominate additional municipal public
defenders with advice and consent of the Council as necessary
to administer justice in a timely and effective manner in the
municipal court. Additional nominations shall be subject to the
provisions of this Chapter 3-78.1.
(c) The Mayor shall nominate a "chief municipal public defender
with advice and consent of the Council, if the Municipal Court
has two or more municipal public defenders. The chief
municipal public defender shall have authority over other
municipal public defenders serving that court with respect to
the performance of their duties.
(d) Appointments to fill vacancies in the position of municipal
public defender shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter 3-78.1 as soon as practicable.
(e) In addition to any other means provided by law for the removal
from office of a public official, a municipal public defender may
be removed by the governing body of the municipality for good
cause shown and after a public hearing, and upon due notice
and an opportunity to be heard. Failure to reappoint a
municipal public defender for a second or subsequent term
§ 3-78.1 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 3-78.1
1:82
does not constitute a "removal from office" within the meaning
of this subsection.
(f) The municipal public defenders may represent private clients
in any municipality, including the municipality where they act
as a municipal public defender, subject to the Rules of Court
Governing the Conduct of Lawyers, Judges and Court
Personnel.
(2) Reporting and Payment.
(a) All Municipal Public Defenders shall provide monthly or
quarterly reports and vouchers as to services rendered during
that month to the Township Council.
(b) A municipal public defender shall receive compensation, either
on an hourly, per diem, annual or other basis as the
municipality may provide. The compensation of a municipal
public defender for services rendered pursuant to the
provisions of this act shall be in lieu of any and all other
compensation by the municipality. The ordinance, resolution or
agreement setting compensation shall set forth any additional
compensation to be paid for interlocutory appeals in the
Superior Court.
F. Duties of municipal public defender.
(1) It shall be the duty of the municipal public defender to represent,
except in the case of temporary unavailability or conflict of interest,
any defendant charged with an offense in municipal court who is an
indigent municipal defendant entitled to representation pursuant
to this act. All necessary services and facilities of representation,
including both expert and lay investigation and testimony as well as
other preparations, shall be provided in every case. The
municipality shall be responsible for payment for services pursuant
to this Section 6. The factors of need and real value to a defendant
may be weighed against the financial constraints of the
municipality in determining the necessary services and facilities of
representation. The final determination as to necessity for services
required pursuant to this Section 6 shall be made by the court.
(2) A municipal public defender shall be responsible for handling all
phases of the defense, including but not limited to discovery,
pretrial and post-trial hearings, motions, removals to federal
district court and other collateral functions reasonably related to
the defense. As used in this Subsection F(2), "post-trial hearing"
shall not include de novo appeals in Superior Court.
(3) Nothing in this Section 6 shall be deemed to require the
municipality to pay for expert and lay investigation or testimony for
a period of one year after the effective date of P.L. 1997, c. 256 (C.
2B:24-1 et seq.)
§ 3-78.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 3-78.1
1:83
G. Representation of indigent defendants.
(1) The municipal public defender shall represent an indigent
defendant charged in Municipal Court with a crime as specified in
N.J.S.A. 2B:12-18 or, if in the opinion of the Municipal Court there is
a likelihood that the defendant, if convicted, of any other offense
will be subject to imprisonment or other consequence of
magnitude, the municipal public defender shall represent an
indigent defendant.
(2) If there is a vacancy in the office of municipal public defender, if the
municipal public defender is temporarily unavailable or if a finding
of conflict of interest precludes the municipal public defender from
representing an indigent defendant, the municipal prosecutor may
prosecute the offense if the municipal court appoints a qualified
attorney to represent the indigent defendant. Unless rates are
otherwise established by the municipality, the attorney shall be
entitled to compensation at the same rate as attorneys hired by the
Office of the Public Defender in conflict cases, with payment to be
made within 30 days. Once appointed, the attorney shall carry out
all duties of the municipal public defender in connection with the
case that is the subject of the appointment.
H. Communications protected under attorney-client privilege.
All communications between the indigent defendant and the municipal
public defender or any other attorney appointed to act as a municipal
public defender shall be fully protected by the attorney-client privilege
to the same extent and degree as though counsel has been privately
engaged. This shall not preclude the use by the municipal public
defender of privileged material for the preparation and disclosure of
statistical, case study and other sociological data, provided that in any
such use there shall be no disclosure of the identity of or means for
discovery of the identity of particular defendants.
I. Application for municipal public defender services.
(1) Eligibility For Services Of Municipal Public Defender.
(a) Eligibility for services of the municipal public defender shall be
determined by the municipal court on the basis of the need of
the defendant, except as provided in Section 12 of this Chapter
3-78.1. Need shall be measured according to section 14 of P.L.
1967, c. 43 (C. 2A:158A-14) and guidelines promulgated by the
New Jersey Supreme Court.
(b) In the event that a determination of eligibility cannot be made
before the time when the first services are to be rendered, or if
an initial determination is found to be erroneous, the municipal
court shall refer the defendant to the municipal public
defender provisionally, and if subsequently it is determined
that the defendant is ineligible the Municipal Court shall
§ 3-78.1 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 3-78.1
1:84
inform the defendant, and the defendant shall be obliged to
engage his own counsel and to reimburse the municipality for
the cost of the services rendered to the time.
(2) Application Fee, Waiver; Deposit In Dedicated Fund.
(a) Every person applying for representation by a Municipal Public
Defender shall, on approval of his application, pay an
application fee of not more than $200 to the Municipal Court
Administrator of the East Brunswick Municipal Court. The
Municipal Court may permit a person to pay the application fee
over a specific period of time not to exceed four months. In
accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Supreme
Court, the Municipal Court may waive any required application
fee, in whole or in part, only if the Court determines, in its
discretion, upon a clear and convincing showing by the
applicant that the application fee represents an unreasonable
burden on the person seeking representation.
(b) Funds collected pursuant to Subsection a of this Section 9.2
shall be deposited in a dedicated fund administered by the
chief financial officer of the municipality or in the case of a
joint municipal court in a manner agreed to by the constituent
municipalities. Such funds shall be used exclusively to meet
the costs incurred in providing the services of a municipal
public defender including, when required, expert and lay
investigation and testimony.
(c) Beginning in 1999, if it is determined by the Division of Local
Government Services during its annual review of the municipal
budget that the amount of money in a dedicated fund
established pursuant to this Section 9.2 exceeds by more than
25% the amount which the municipality expended during the
prior year providing the services of a municipal public
defender, the amount in excess of the amount expended shall
be forwarded to the Criminal Disposition and Review
Collection Fund administered by Victims of Crime
Compensation Board.
J. Investigation of financial status of defendant.
The Municipal Court shall make an investigation of the financial status
of each defendant seeking representation pursuant to this act and shall
have the authority to require a defendant to execute and deliver written
requests or authorizations required under applicable law to provide the
court with access to records of public or private sources, otherwise
confidential, as may be of aid in evaluating eligibility. The court is
authorized to obtain information from any public record office of the
State or of any subdivision or agency thereof on request and without
payment of the fees ordinarily required by law.
K. Eligibility of defendant under 18 years of age.
§ 3-78.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 3-78.1
1:85
Whenever a person entitled to representation by a municipal public
defender pursuant to this act, is under the age of 18 years, the
eligibility for services shall be determined on the basis of the financial
circumstances of the individual and the financial circumstances of the
individual's parents or legal guardians. The municipality shall be
entitled to recover the cost of legal services from the parents or legal
guardians as provided in Section 17 of this Chapter 3-78.1 and the
Municipal Court shall have authority to require parents or legal
guardians to execute and deliver the written requests or authorization
required under applicable law in order to provide the court with access
to records of public or private sources, otherwise confidential, as may
be of aid to it in evaluating eligibility.
L. Reimbursement to municipality.
If the defendant has or reasonably expects to have means to meet
some part, though not all, of the cost of the services rendered, the
defendant shall be required to reimburse the municipality, either by a
single payment or in installments in such amounts as he can reasonably
be expected to pay; but no default or failure in making payment shall
affect or reduce the rendering of services.
M. Lien on property of defendant.
(1) The municipality shall have a lien on any property to which the
defendant shall have or acquire an interest for an amount equal to
the reasonable value of the services rendered to a defendant
pursuant to this Chapter 3-78.1 as calculated at the same rate as
the Office of the Public Defender bills clients at that time.
(2) To effectuate such a lien for the municipality, the municipal
attorney shall file a notice setting forth services rendered to the
defendant and the reasonable value thereof with the Clerk of the
Superior Court. The filing of the notice with the Clerk of the
Superior Court shall constitute a lien on property for a period of 10
years from the date of filing, unless discharged sooner, and, except
for such time limitations, shall have the force and effect of a
judgment. Within 10 days of the filing of the notice, the municipal
attorney shall send by certified mail, or serve personally, a copy of
the notice with a statement of the date of the filing to or upon the
defendant at the defendant's last known address. If the municipal
attorney shall fail to give notice, the lien is void.
N. Compromise, settlement of claims.
The municipal attorney is authorized to compromise and settle any
claim for services performed pursuant to this Chapter 3-78.1 whenever
the financial circumstances of the person receiving the services are

Health, Environment and Welfare finds that the public safety will not
permit delay, he may exercise one or more of the following powers
without having to resort to legal proceedings and without the necessity
of giving notice or holding a hearing which would otherwise be required
under any provision of this chapter.
(1) Power to prevent the sale of food. The Director of the Department
of Health, Environment and Welfare may prohibit the importation,
storage or sale of any food, drink or other items intended for human
consumption or use from a source suspected of being infected,
contaminated, unsanitary, unhealthy or dangerous.
(2) Power to seize and destroy unwholesome food. The Director of the
Department of Health, Environment and Welfare may order the

for human consumption or use which are unwholesome or
dangerous or likely to cause sickness or injury to the persons who
consume or use it.
(3) Suspension of licenses. The Director of the Department of Health,
Environment and Welfare may temporarily suspend the license of

as he deems necessary to prevent the operation of the licensed
activity, including but not limited to impounding items intended for
human consumption, merchandise, supplies and equipment
necessary to carry on the licensed activity and posting and

§ 3-93 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 3-95
1:103

regular program of inspection.
(2) Search warrant. If the owner or occupant of any premises refuses
to permit entry for the purpose of inspection, the Director of the
Department of Health, Environment and Welfare may apply to the
Magistrate of the Township of East Brunswick or any other court of
competent jurisdiction for a search warrant. The application shall
be based upon an affidavit setting forth that the inspection is part
of a regular program of inspections or that conditions and
circumstances, which shall be specified in the affidavit, exist which
provide a reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance, unhealthy
or unsanitary condition or violation of any provisions of this chapter
exists on the premises. If the Magistrate is satisfied as to the
matters set forth in the affidavit, he shall authorize the issuance of
a search warrant permitting access to and inspection of the

and Welfare. In the event of an emergency or in the event that the
owner or person in control of the premises fails to comply with the
notice within the time specified, or otherwise fails to remove or
abate the nuisance or condition, the Director of the Department of
Health, Environment and Welfare or his agents or employees shall
proceed to abate the nuisance or condition or may cause it to be
removed or abated in a summary manner by such means as he shall
deem proper.
(3) Recovery of costs.

condition was located.
[2] Where the Township is not permitted by law or it is
impractical to proceed under Subsection C(3)(a)[1], the
cost or expense shall be recovered by an action at law in
any court of competent jurisdiction, which action shall be
instituted by the Director of the Department of Health,
Environment and Welfare in the name of the Township.
(b) Regardless of how costs are actually recovered they shall be in
addition to and shall not affect the imposition of any penalties
for the violation of this chapter.
(4) Manner of giving notice. Where the owner resides in the Township
or in the case of a tenant, written notice shall be served by
delivering a copy to him personally; or by leaving a copy thereof at

GENERAL REFERENCES
§ 3-126 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 3-126
1:137
N.J.S.A. 43:15B-1 provides that any municipality may establish a deferred
compensation plan whereby the employer may enter into written agreement
with any of its employees thereby providing a voluntary deferral of salary
and such deferral shall remain in effect until the employee is terminated
or until a new contract is executed by the employee and employer. The
provisions of the salary deferral shall be in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40A:4-2
of the local budget law, which requires that one or more public officials,
or the governing body as a whole, shall be designated and named to the
fiduciary responsibility for administration of said plan and investments.
The deferred compensation plan which is established shall be in compliance
with Section 457 of the Federal Internal Revenue Code and recent
amendments as adopted by the Congress through Revenue Acts of 1978
which require that all eligible state deferred compensation plans comply
with the classification systems to guarantee compliance with regulations
of the I.R.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of
Social Security and the State enabling legislation.
The administration of the deferred compensation plan is recognized as a
critical factor and the rules and regulations provided for implementation
shall be promulgated by the Township Administrator and Director of
Finance and listed as part of the administrative procedures manual
clarifying such questions as, the interface with the local payroll system; who
shall be the plan coordinator; how collections of payments shall be made;
the role and responsibility of custodial functions; to insure appropriate
deferrals and safeguard with stringent control for accuracy, safety and
timeliness of investments. Also individual participants should receive
annual statements which reflect both the value of contributions and the
total amount which has been contributed. To insure compliance with the
federal regulations, clear procedures providing for an employee's
withdrawal of funds must be established and an annual review of these
procedures should be initiated each year.
Nothing herein shall obligate the Township of East Brunswick to set up or
maintain a deferred compensation plan.

ALARM SYSTEMS
§ 43-1. Findings and Declarations.
The Township Council does hereby find and declare that:
§ 43-2. Purpose.
A. The occupants of numerous residential, commercial and industrial
establishments in the Township of East Brunswick have found it
desirable to make provision for the installation, upon their premises at
their own cost and expense, of alarm systems for emergencies such as
burglar, fire and like alarms.
B. There is a growing number of alarm companies that sell or lease such
alarm systems entering into contracts with such occupants for the
installation, operation and maintenance of such alarm systems and
providing for the connection to the individual alarm system so installed
by them to a central location.
C. The number of private enterprises engaged in the alarm business, each
with its own system and equipment, has resulted in conditions that, if
not remedied, will lead to an unnecessary drain on the manpower, time,
space facilities and finances of the Township of East Brunswick and its
Public Safety Department and the deterioration of the quality of service
to persons subscribing to the alarm services and inequities among the
alarm businesses in the Township of East Brunswick.
A. The purpose of this ordinance is to provide standards and regulations
for various types of local alarms, burglar, fire and other emergency
alarm devices whether by direct line, telephone or other means,
actuating devices at the East Brunswick Police Headquarters requiring
a response by the police department or fire department.
B. This chapter is also meant to encourage alarm users and alarm
companies to properly use and maintain the operation, effectiveness

alarms which may unduly divert law enforcement from responding to
criminal activity.
C. This chapter governs systems intended to summon law enforcement
response, requires registration, establishes fees, provides for penalties
for violations, establishes a system of administration and sets
conditions for suspension or loss of registration.
A. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to any person, other than
the municipality, who operates, maintains or owns any alarm device or
local alarm designed to summon the police or fire department to any

designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or
other activity requiring immediate attention and to which law
enforcement is requested to respond such as burglary, intrusion, fire or

§ 43-2 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 43-4
1:140
alarms, boat alarms, domestic violence alarms and alarms designed to
elicit a medical response.
G. ALARM USER  Any person, corporation, limited-liability company,
partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any
other entity owning, leasing or operating an alarm system, or who
(which) controls a security alarm system at an alarm site; is named on
the registration; and is financially responsible for the operation of an
alarm system. Alarm user may mean more than one person, if more
than one person is listed on the registration and has accepted financial
responsibility for the operation of the alarm system.
H. ALARM USER AWARENESS CLASS  A class conducted for the
purpose of educating alarm users about the responsible use, operation
and maintenance of alarm systems and the problems created by false
alarms.
I. ANSI/SIA CONTROL PANEL STANDARD CP-01  The American
National Standard Institute (ANSI) approved Security Industry
Association (SIA) CP-01 Control Panel Standard, as may be updated
from time to time, that details recommended design features for
security system control panels and their associated arming and
disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and
tested to this standard by a nationally recognized testing organization
will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA
CP-01 Control Panel Standard Features for False Alarm Reduction."
J. AUTOMATIC DIAL PROTECTION DEVICE  An automatic dialing
device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall
include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates
to the East Brunswick Police Department a recorded message or code
signal indicating a need for law enforcement response.
K. BURGLARY ALARM (also "property/intrusion alarm")  An alarm
system that is used to detect and report an unauthorized entry or an

L. CANCELLATION  The process where response is terminated when
the alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies the East
Brunswick Police Department that there is not an existing situation at
the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch
request. If cancellation occurs prior to police arriving at the scene, this
is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil penalty, and no penalty will
be assessed.
M. CENTRAL OFFICE ALARM  Any alarm which when activated
transmits a signal to a remote location indicating an alarm condition.
N. CHIEF  The Chief of Police of the Township of East Brunswick or his
designee.

O. ENHANCED CALL VERIFICATION (ECV)  An attempt by the
monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site
and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether
or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine
whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement
dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request.
For the purpose of this chapter, telephone verification shall require, as
a minimum that a second call be made to a different number if the first
attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify himself
or herself to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid
before requesting law enforcement dispatch.
P. FALSE ALARM RESPONSE  The activation of an alarm system
through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper
installation or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or
agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement personnel,
unless law enforcement response was canceled by the alarm user or
his/her agent before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm
location.
This also means a police department response to an alarm dispatch
request by a commissioned officer of the department where, in the
opinion of that officer, no evidence of the commission or attempted
commission of a crime is present that can be reasonably attributed to
have caused the alarm activation.
A false alarm response is also deemed to have occurred when the
responding officer is unable to determine if evidence of a criminal
offense or attempted criminal offense is present because the alarm site
is inaccessible (e.g., where the alarm site is located:
1) Within a locked structure, such as an apartment building or
business complex with a common entry; or
2) Behind a locked gate and no person is present to provide access to
the officer; or
3) Contains a dog and no person is present to remove the dog so the
officer can inspect the site; or
4) Contains any type of "protective/reactive" device or contrivance).
A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be
determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent
conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary
circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user.
Q. GRACE PERIOD  No violation shall be assessed to any owner or
person that maintains an alarm system as provided for and defined
herein during the first 30 days of installation.
§ 43-4 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 43-4
1:142
§ 43-5. Issuance of Permits: Registration Terms and Fees.
R. LOCAL ALARM  An alarm system that emits a signal at an alarm site
that is audible or visible from the exterior of a structure and is not
monitored by a remote monitoring facility, whether installed by an
alarm company or user.
S. PERMIT YEAR  A twelve-month period beginning on the day and
month on which an alarm permit is issued.
T. PERMITTEE  Any person owning or leasing an alarm device of any
type within the Township of East Brunswick.
U. PERSON  Includes any natural person, partnership, corporation or
association, or any other legal entity.
V. ROBBERY ALARM (also "duress alarm", "hold-up alarm" or "panic
alarm")  An alarm signal generated by the manual or automatic
activation of a device, or any system, device or mechanism, on or near
the premises intended to signal that a robbery or other crime is in
progress, and that one or more persons are in need of immediate police
assistance in order to avoid injury, serious bodily harm or death at the
hands of the perpetrator of the robbery or other crime.
W. RUNAWAY ALARM  An alarm system that produces repeated alarm
signals that do not appear to be caused by separate human action. The
East Brunswick Police Department may in its discretion discontinue
police responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway
alarm.
X. SUSPEND ("suspension")  For the purposes of this chapter, means the
temporary loss for an alarm user of the privileges associated
specifically with the registration of a security alarm system in the
Township of East Brunswick.
Y. TOWNSHIP  The Township of East Brunswick or its agent(s).
A. Alarm registration is valid for one year. An alarm registration shall
expire one year from the date of issuance, and must be renewed
annually by submitting an updated application to the alarm
administrator or its designated vendor. The alarm administrator shall
notify each alarm user of the need to renew thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the registration. It is the responsibility of the alarm user to
submit an application prior to the registration expiration date. Failure
to renew will be classified as use of a non-registered alarm system and
citations and penalties shall be assessed without waiver. A late fee will
be assessed if the renewal is more than thirty (30) days late.
B. Alarm registration is issued to a person or persons ("alarm user")
having bona fide ownership or control of an alarm site (i.e., home
owner, business owner, renter, leaseholder, etc.) and specifically for
that alarm site or address.
§ 43-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 43-5
1:143
1) Alarm registration remains in the name(s) of the alarm user of
record until a change of ownership or control of the alarm site
occurs.

maintained is transferred, the person (user) obtaining possession
of the property shall file an application for an alarm permit within
30 days of obtaining possession of the property.
3) There shall be a grace period where no violation shall be assessed
to any owner or person that maintains an alarm system as provided
for and defined herein during the first 30 days of installation.

ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
§ 49-1. Legislative findings; purpose.
The Township Council hereby finds that uniformity in the exterior design
and appearance of dwellings erected in the same residential neighborhood
tends to adversely affect the desirability of the immediate and neighboring
areas for residential purposes; tends to impair the value of both improved
and unimproved real property in such areas with attendant deterioration of
conditions affecting the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants
thereof and the community at large; and tends to deprive the municipality of
tax revenue and destroys a proper balance between the taxable value of real
property in such areas and the cost of municipal services provided therefor.
It is the purpose of this chapter to prevent these and other harmful effects of
uniformity in the design and appearance of dwellings erected in any housing
development in the same residential neighborhood and thus to promote and
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the community.
§ 49-2. Construction of house substantially the same in exterior
design and appearance prohibited.

FARMING AND AGRICULTURE
§ 99-1. Right to Farm. [Amended 3-27-89 by Ord. No. 89-6]
The Township of East Brunswick recognizes the right to farm, subject to
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, and subject also to the restrictions
and regulations which may affect farming and agriculture, as set forth in
all health and sanitary codes of the Federal Government, the State of New
Jersey, the County of Middlesex and the Township of East Brunswick.
§ 99-2. Interpretation.
The right to farm as it is used in this section includes the use of large
irrigation pumps and equipment, serial and ground seeding and spraying,
large tractors, numerous farm laborers and the application of chemical
fertilizers and products for the control and elimination of insects, pests,
weeds, fungus and other substances injurious to the farming process or
for the purpose of producing from the land agricultural products, such as
vegetables, grains, hay, fruits, fibers, potatoes, wood, trees, plants, shrubs,
flowers and seeds. This right to farm shall also include the right to use land
for grazing by animals, subject to the restrictions contained elsewhere in
this Code for raising livestock.
§ 99-3. Regulation of Hours.
The foregoing uses and activities permitted in the Rural Preservation Zone,
when reasonable and necessary for the particular farming, livestock or fowl
production, and when conducted in accordance with generally accepted
agricultural practices as the same may be determined and promulgated,
from time to time, by the Rutgers University School of Agriculture, may
occur on holidays, Sundays and weekdays, and the odors, dust and fumes
that are caused by the farming activities are specifically permitted as part
of the exercise of the right to farm in the Rural Preservation Zone.
§ 99-4. Findings.
It is expressly found that whatever temporary inconveniences may be
caused to others by such uses and activities so conducted, they are more
than offset by the benefits from farming to the neighborhood and
community and to society in general, by the preservation and continuance
of farming operations in East Brunswick Township and in New Jersey as a
source of agricultural products for this and future generations.

ARTICLE IV
Food Packaging
[Adopted 4-8-91 by Ord. No. 91-32]; [Amended 8-26-91 by Ord. No.
91-88]
§ 109-15. Food Packaging.
The East Brunswick Township Council finds that discarded packaging of
food is a significant source of litter and municipal waste disposal. The
chemical composition and ability of a substance to degrade are useful
criteria in establishing a policy of solid waste and litter control. Polystyrene
foam is not biodegradable. Retail food establishments in East Brunswick
are the points of origin for polystyrene foam. Their use of polystyrene
foam poses a threat to the environment by taking up landfill space and
by the possible introduction of carbon dioxide and ash when completely
combusted. There is no economically viable market for recycling
polystyrene foam. Other plastic and/or paper products are available as
substitutes. Plastics constitute 6% of all roadside litter, according to a
study commissioned by the Federal Highway Commission. The disposal of
polystyrene foam at sea has a very serious negative effect on marine life.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are chemical compounds used as an expansion
agent in polystyrene foam food service products. When released into the
atmosphere, CFCs rise to the stratosphere where they break down and
release chlorine. The chlorine then acts to reduce the stratospheric ozone
layer causing an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching
the earth. The Township Council, by enacting this ordinance, is seeking to
reduce the non-recyclable, non-degradable food packaging products and the
Council is also seeking to reduce the amount of litter adversely affecting the
air, land and waters of the Township of East Brunswick.
This ordinance will serve the public interest by reducing the quantity of nonbiodegradable
waste in landfills serving East Brunswick. A portion of any
substitute packaging will be composed of products that are biodegradable
in whole or in part.
Polystyrene foam packaging takes up more space in landfills than many
other packaging materials, because of the comparatively low density of
Polystyrene foam and its present popularity as a packaging material. Siting
and developing landfills is an increasingly expensive undertaking, and these
costs place an economic burden on the residents or the Township of East
Brunswick, Maximizing the operating life of landfill facilities therefore
promotes the public interest, and this interest will be served by reducing
the amount of Polystyrene foam deposited in landfills.
The Council recognizes that other commonly used food packaging materials
are also non-biodegradable and contribute to litter and landfill problems;
nevertheless, the Council finds that it is appropriate to regulate Polystyrene
foam food packaging while not regulating other types of food packaging at
this time for the following reasons:
§ 109-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 109-15
1:251
§ 109-16. Definitions. [Amended 8-26-91 by Ord. No. 91-88]
A. To minimize disruption in the food services industry, the Council should
avoid banning a wide range of packaging materials at one time. It might
be appropriate to ban other packaging materials in the future, but an
incremental approach to eliminating undesirable packaging materials
will cause less disruption and allow the Township of East Brunswick to
handle enforcement proceedings in more manageable stages.
B. Polystyrene foam is the least dense commonly used food packaging
material, and therefore is more wasteful of landfill space than any other
category of food packaging material. It is therefore appropriate to start
with Polystyrene foam as the Township of East Brunswick begins to
address the issues of litter and inappropriate utilization of landfill
space.
C. Ingestion of Polystyrene foam particles has been identified as a hazard
to wildlife, while this problem has not been associated with other food
packaging materials.
a. "Biodegradable Packaging" shall mean packaging made of cellulose
based substances or other substances which are capable of being
readily attacked, decomposed, assimilated, and/or otherwise
completely oxidized or broken down into its constituent parts by
bacteria, natural biological organisms, carbonaceous soil material,
water, carbon dioxide; or in the alternative capable of otherwise
degrading when exposed to ultraviolet light or other natural processes
beginning within a twelve month period from the date of manufacture
or exposure to the environment.
b. "Packaging" shall mean all food-related wrappings including but not
limited to bags, sacks, wrappings, containers, bowls, plates, trays,
cartons, cups or drinking utensils intended for use within the Township
of East Brunswick.
c. "Prepared food" means food or beverages which are served on the
vendor's premises without preparation, or are prepared on the vendor's
premises by cooking, chopping, slicing, mixing, brewing, freezing or
squeezing. "Prepared food" does not include any raw uncooked meat,
fish, poultry or eggs. Prepared food may be eaten either on or off
premises. [Amended 8-26-91 by Ord. No. 91-88]
d. "Retail Food Vendor" shall mean all sales outlets, stores, shops,
restaurants, or other places of business located within the Township of
East Brunswick, which receive more than twenty (20%) percent of their
revenues through the sales or conveyances of foods directly to the
ultimate consumer, which foods are predominantly contained, wrapped
or held in or on packaging. "Retail Food Vendors" shall include, but not
be limited, to any establishment where food is prepared, mixed, cooked,
baked, smoked, preserved, bottled, packaged, handled, stored,
manufactured, and sold or offered for sale, including but not limited to
§ 109-15 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 109-16
1:252
§ 109-17. Prohibited Packaging. [Amended 8-26-91 by Ord. No.
91-88]
§ 109-18. Enforcement.
This ordinance shall be enforced by the Director of the Department of Public
Works and Water Resources (or his/her designee).
§ 109-19. Township of East Brunswick Purchases Prohibited.
§ 109-20. Involvement of Environmental Commission.
The Township recognizes that total elimination of Polystyrene foam and
other disposable plastic products as a way to reduce litter and reduce the
amount of solid wastes deposited in landfills is a long term community goal.
any fixed or mobile restaurant, drive-in, coffee ship, cafeteria, shortorder
cage, fast food outlet, delicatessen, luncheonette, grill, sandwich
shop, soda fountain, tavern, bar, cocktail lounge, nightclub, inn,
roadside stand, take out prepared food place, industrial feeding
establishment, catering kitchen, grocery store, public food market, food
stand, or similar place in which food or drink is prepared for sale or for
service on the premises or elsewhere and any other establishment or
operation including homes, where food is processed, prepared, stored,
served, or provided to the public for charge, provided said vendor shall
derive more than twenty (20%) percent of its gross revenues from the
sale of said food or drink.
a. No retail food vendor located and doing business in the Township of
East Brunswick shall sell or convey prepared food directly to the
ultimate consumer within the Township of East Brunswick if the
packaging for such food consists of polystyrene foam or products in
which Pentane gas, Hydrocarbons, Fluorocarbons or similar gases are
utilized during manufacture. For the purposes of this section,
conclusion of the sales transaction shall be the point of time at which
the possession of the food product passes from the retail food vendor to
the ultimate consumer, and the conclusion of the sales transaction need
not require the actual payment of consideration for such food product,
provided however payment is expected from the ultimate consumer
prior to the consumer exiting the premises of the retail food vendor.
b. (Reserved) [Deleted 8-26-91 by Ord. No. 91-88]
a. The Township of East Brunswick shall not purchase any food packaging
which contains polystyrene foam and will discontinue the use of
polystyrene foam in connection with the packaging of food. The
Township shall not sponsor any event which utilizes such packaging.
b. The Township Clerk shall be directed to exclusively advertise for the
receipt of bids for biodegradable materials whenever said bids are
required by the Township of East Brunswick.
§ 109-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 109-20
1:253
Total elimination will require substantial financial commitments and should
include public education. To these ends, the Township Council hereby
directs the East Brunswick Environmental Commission to make
recommendations to the Township Council for reduction of disposable
plastic products in landfills and in the litter stream. The Environmental
Commission should consider the following in their recommendations:
§ 109-21. Penalties.
Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this Article shall
be subject to a fine not exceeding One thousand ($1,000.00) Dollars. In
addition to the aforesaid fines, a person found guilty of violating this Article
may be subject to up to 45 (forty-five) hours of community service. Each
day upon which a violation is committed shall be considered a separate
violation.
§ 109-22. Exemptions.
The Township Council may exempt a food vendor or food packager from
the requirements of this ordinance for a one year period, upon a showing
by the applicant that the conditions of this ordinance would cause undue
hardship. The phrase "undue hardship" shall be construed to include, but
not be limited to:
(a) Public Education and Promotion
(b) Alternative Product Recycling/Energy Conversion
(c) Financial Assistance
(d) Alternative Products Research (e.g., photo-degradable and
biodegradable additives)
The Environmental Commission will prepare a report to be submitted
to the Township Council within one year of the effective date of this
ordinance. The report shall assess the success of the efforts to reduce
litter and solid waste and make appropriate recommendations for
improvement and continuation of such efforts.
1. Situations where there are no acceptable alternatives to Polystyrene
food packaging for reasons which are unique to vendor, packager, or
provider;
2. Situations where compliance with the requirements of this ordinance
would deprive a person of a legally protected right. If a request for
exemption is based upon a claim that a legally protected right would be
denied if compliance were required and such request for exemption is
denied, review of the denial shall only be to the Superior Court of New
Jersey, and not otherwise.

Zoning Board
§ 132-16. Establishment.
There is hereby established, pursuant to Section 57, P.L. 1975, c. 291
(N.J.R.S. 40:55D-69a), a Zoning Board of Adjustment, also known as the
"Zoning Board" or the "Board of Adjustment".
§ 132-17. Membership. [Amended 6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19; 3-7-05
by Ord. No. 05-03]
The Board shall consist of seven (7) members and not more than four
(4) alternate members who shall be residents of the Township of East
Brunswick. Alternate members shall be designated at the time of authority
appointing them as "Alternate No. 1", "Alternate No. 2, Alternate 3" and
Alternate 4" as appropriate.
Alternate members may participate in discussions of the proceedings, but
may not vote, except in the absence or disqualification of a regular member.
Participation of alternate members shall not be deemed to increase the size
of the zoning board of adjustment established by ordinance of the governing
body pursuant to section 56 of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (C. 40.55D-69). A vote
shall not be delayed in order that a regular member may vote instead of
an alternate member. In the event that a choice must be made as to which
alternate member is to vote, alternate members shall vote in the order of
their numerical designations.
If the Board of Adjustment lacks a quorum because any of its regular
or alternate members is prohibited by section 56 of P.L. 1975, c. 291
(C. 40:55D-69) from acting on a matter due to the member's personal or
financial interest therein, Class IV members of the Planning Board shall be
called upon to serve, for that matter only, as temporary members of the
Board of Adjustment. The Class IV members of the Planning Board shall
be called upon to serve in order of seniority of continuous service to the
Planning Board until there are the minimum number of members necessary
to constitute a quorum to act upon the matter without any personal or
financial interest therein, whether direct or indirect. If a choice has to be
made between Class IV members of equal seniority, the chairman of the
Planning Board shall make the choice.
§ 132-18. Terms of Office. [Amended 3-7-05 by Ord. No. 05-03]
The members of the Board of Adjustment shall be appointed by the
Township Council. The terms of the members first appointed under this
chapter shall be so determined that to the greatest practicable extent,
the expiration of such terms shall be distributed, in the case of regular
members, evenly over the first four (4) years after their appointment, and
in the case of alternate members, evenly over the first two years after their
appointment; provided that the initial term of no regular members shall
exceed four years and that the initial term of no alternate member shall
§ 132-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-18
1:305
exceed two years. Thereafter, the term of each member shall be four (4)
years; and the term of each alternate member shall be two years. The terms
of not more than two alternate members shall expire in any one year.
§ 132-19. Vacancies. [Amended 3-7-05 by Ord. No. 05-03]
A vacancy occurring otherwise than by expiration of a term shall be filled for
the unexpired term only. A member may, after public hearing if he requests
it, be removed by the Township Council for cause.
§ 132-20. Organization.
§ 132-21. Powers. [Amended 6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to:
A. The Board of Adjustment shall elect a Chairman and Vice Chairman
from its members and select a Secretary who may or may not be a
member of the Board of Adjustment or a municipal employee.
B. The Board of Adjustment may employ or contract for and fix the
compensation of legal counsel, other than the Municipal Attorney. The
Zoning Board of Adjustment may also employ or contract for and fix the
compensation of such experts and other staff and services as it may
deem necessary. The Board shall not authorize expenditures which
exceed, exclusive of gifts or grants, the amount appropriated by the
Township Council for its use.
C. The Board of Adjustment shall adopt such rules and regulations as may
be necessary to carry into effect the powers granted to it by this
chapter.
A. Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there
is an error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal made by the
Director of Planning and Engineering or his designee, based on or made
in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance.
B. Hear and decide requests for interpretation of the Zoning Map or
Zoning Ordinance, or for decisions upon other special questions upon
which such Board is authorized to pass by the Zoning Ordinance or
Official Map ordinance in accordance with this act.
C. 1. Where (a) by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property; or (b) by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting a
specific piece of property; or (c) by reason of an extraordinary and
exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of property
or structures lawfully existing thereon, the strict application of any
zoning regulation would result in peculiar and exceptional practical
difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon the
developer of such property, grant upon an application or an appeal
§ 132-18 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-21
1:306
relating to such property, a variance from such strict application of
such regulation so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship;
2. Where in an application or appeal relating to a specific piece of
property the purposes of this act would be advanced by a deviation
from the zoning ordinance requirements and the benefits of the
deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment, grant a
variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-62 et seq; provided; however, that no variance from those
departures enumerated in subsection d of this section shall be
granted under this subsection; and provided further that the
proposed development does not require approval by the planning
board of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use in conjunction
with which the planning board has power to review a request for a
variance pursuant to N.J.S.A. C. 40:55D-60a.
D. In particular cases and for special reasons grant a variance to allow
departure from regulations pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-62-68, to
permit (1)a use or principal structure in a district restricted against
such use or principal structure, (2) an expansion of a nonconforming
use, (3) deviation from a specification or standard pursuant to C.
40:55D-67 pertaining solely to a conditional use, (4) an increase in the
permitted floor area ratio as defined in C. 40:55D-4, (5) an increase in
the permitted density as defined in C. 40:55D-4 except as applied to the
required lot area for a lot or lots for detached one or two dwelling unit
buildings which lot or lots are either an isolated undersized lot or lots
resulting from a minor subdivision or (6) a height of a principal
structure which exceeds by 10 feet or 10% the maximum height
permitted in the district for a principal structure. A variance under this
subsection shall be granted only by affirmative vote of at least five
members.
If an application for development requests one or more variances but
not a variance for a purpose enumerated in subsection d of this section,
the decision on the requested variance or variances shall be rendered
under subsection c of this section.
No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this
section unless such variance or other relief can be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially
impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and zoning
ordinance. In respect of any airport hazard area delineated under
the "Air Safety and Hazardous Zoning Act of 1983, N.J.S. 6:1-80", no
variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this Section
permitting the creation or establishment of a non-conforming use which
would be prohibited under the standards promulgated pursuant to
that Act except upon issuance of a permit by the Commissioner of
Transportation. An application under this Section may be referred to
any appropriate person or agency for its report, provided that such
reference shall not extend the period of time within which the Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall act. [Amended 6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]

A. Purpose. In Holmdel Builder's Association V. Holmdel Township, 121
N.J. 550 (1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that
mandatory development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of
1985 (the Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution,
subject to the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of
rules. Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 section 8 (C. 52:27D-329.2) and the
Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act (C. 40:55D-8.1
through 8.7), COAH was authorized to adopt and promulgate

purposes of calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest
density permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the
filing of the variance application. [Amended 4-18-05 by Ord. No.
05-06; 4-24-06 by Ord. No. 06-15; 9-14-09 by Ord. No. 09-19]

fees.
2. Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of this Ordinance shall be exempt
from the payment of development fees, unless the developer seeks
a substantial change in the original approval. Where site plan
approval is not applicable, the issuance of a Zoning Permit and/or
Construction Permit shall be synonymous with preliminary or final
site plan approval for the purpose of determining the right to an
exemption. In all cases, the applicable fee percentage shall be
determined based upon the Development Fee Ordinance in effect
on the date that the Construction Permit is issued.
3. Improvements or additions to existing one and two-family dwellings
on individual lots shall not be required to pay a development fee,
but a development fee shall be charged for any new dwelling
constructed as a replacement for a previously existing dwelling on
the same lot that was or will be demolished, unless the owner
resided in the previous dwelling for a period of one year or more
prior to obtaining a demolition permit. Where a development fee is
charged for a replacement dwelling, the development fee shall be
calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed value of the
new structure as compared to the previous structure.
4. Homes replaced as a result of a natural disaster (such as a fire or
flood) shall be exempt from the payment of a development fee.

one-half (2.5) percent of the equalized assessed value of the land and
improvements, for all new non-residential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots. Non-residential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall also

in equalized assessed value resulting from any additions to existing
structures to be used for non-residential purposes

a half percent (2.5%) shall be calculated on the difference between the
equalized assessed value of the pre-existing land and improvement and
the equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e. land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is issued. If
the calculation required under this section results in a negative number,
the non-residential development fee shall be zero. [Amended 9-14-09
by Ord. No. 09-19]
F. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for nonresidential
development:
1) The non-residential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the two and a half (2.5)
percent development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.

an increase in equalized assessed value resulting from alterations,
change in use within the existing footprint, reconstruction,
renovations and repairs.
3) Non-residential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
non-residential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the

non-residential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 shall
be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies, and shall make the payment of the non-residential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the nonresidential
development, whichever is later.
5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a nonresidential
development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt from
property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the fees
required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the termination
of the property tax exemption. Unpaid non-residential development
fees under these circumstances may be enforceable by the
Township of East Brunswick as a lien against the real property of
the owner

amount of the bills exceeds the amount escrowed. The applicant shall
place on the record its agreement to be bound by the provisions of the
Township's escrow ordinances.
A. No professional personnel submitting bills to the Township under this
chapter shall charge for any of the services referred to therein at any
higher rate or in any different manner from that which would normally
be charged to the municipality for similar work. Payment of any bill
rendered by a professional to the municipality with respect to any
service for which the municipality is entitled to reimbursement shall in
no way be contingent upon receipt of reimbursement by the applicant,
nor shall any payment for service be delayed pending reimbursement of
the Township by an applicant.
B. Charges for professionals who are employees of the municipality may
not exceed 200% of the sum of the products resulting from multiplying
the hourly base salary (established by ordinance, as aforesaid) by the
number of hours spent by the professional in reviewing the application
for development, including all meetings and site visits.
§ 132-33.3 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-33.6
1:328
pursuant to a voucher from the professional, which voucher shall identify
the personnel performing the service, and for each date the services
performed, the hours spent to one-quarter hour increments, the hourly rate
and the expenses incurred. All professionals shall submit vouchers to the
Chief Financial Officer of the municipality on a monthly basis in accordance
with schedules and procedures established by the Chief Financial Officer
of the municipality. If the services are provided by a municipal employee,
the municipal employee shall prepare and submit to the Chief Financial
Officer of the municipality a statement containing the same information as
required on a voucher, on a monthly basis. The professional shall send an
informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the Chief
Financial Officer of the municipality simultaneously to the applicant. The
Chief Financial Officer of the municipality shall prepare and send to the
applicant a statement which shall include an accounting of funds, listing
all deposits, interest earnings, disbursements, and the cumulative balance
of the escrow account. This information shall be provided on a quarterly
basis if monthly charges are $1,000 or less, or on a monthly basis if monthly
charges exceed $1,000. If an escrow account or deposit contains insufficient
funds to enable the municipality or approving authority to perform required
application reviews or improvement inspections, the Chief Financial Officer
of the municipality shall provide the applicant with a notice of the
insufficient escrow or deposit balance. In order for work to continue on
the development or the application, the applicant shall, within a reasonable
time period, post a deposit to the account in an amount to be agreed upon
by the municipality or approving authority and the applicant. In the interim,
any required health and safety inspections shall be made and charged back
against the replenishment of funds.
§ 132-33.7. Dispute of Charges. [Added 10-2-95 by Ord. No. 95-34]
A. An applicant shall notify, in writing, the governing body, with copies to
the Chief Financial Officer, the approving authority and the
professional, whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by a
professional for service rendered to the municipality in reviewing
applications for development, review and preparation of documents,
inspection of improvements, or other charges made pursuant to the
provisions of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.). The governing
body, or its designee, shall, within a reasonable time period, attempt to
remediate any disputed charges. If the matter is not resolved to the
satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant may appeal to the County
Construction Board of Appeals established under Section 9 of P.L. 1975,
c. 217 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127) any charge to an escrow account or a
deposit by any municipal professional or consultant, or the cost of the
installation of improvements estimated by the Municipal Engineer
pursuant to Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4). An
applicant or his authorized agent shall submit the appeal in writing to
the County Construction Board of Appeals. The applicant or his
authorized agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to the
municipality, approving authority, and any professional whose charge is
the subject of the appeal. An applicant shall file an appeal within 45
§ 132-33.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-33.7
1:329
days from receipt of the informational copy of the professional's
voucher required by Subsection c of Section 13 of P.L. 1991, c. 256
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53-2), except that if the professional has not supplied
the applicant with an informational copy of the professional's voucher,
then the applicant shall file his appeal within 60 days from receipt
of the municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow
account required by Subsection c of Section 13 of P.L. 1991, c. 256
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53-2). An applicant may file an appeal for an ongoing
series of charges by a professional during a period not exceeding six
months to demonstrate that they represent a pattern of excessive or
inaccurate charges. An applicant making use of this provision need not
appeal each charge individually.
B. The County Construction Board of Appeals shall hear the appeal, render
a decision thereon, and file its decision with a statement of the reasons
therefor with the municipality or approving authority not later than 10
business days following the submission of the appeal, unless such
period of time has been extended with the consent of the applicant. The
decision may approve, disapprove, or modify the professional charges
appealed from. A copy of the decision shall be forwarded by certified or
registered mail to the party making the appeal, the municipality, the
approving authority, and the professional involved in the appeal. Failure
by the Board to hear an appeal and render and file a decision thereon
within the time limits prescribed in this subsection shall be deemed a
denial of the appeal for purposes of a complaint, application, or appeal
to a court of competent jurisdiction.
C. The county construction board of appeals shall provide rules for its
procedure in accordance with this section. The board shall have the
power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to compel the
attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant evidence, and
the provisions of the "County and Municipal Investigation Law," P.L.
1953, c. 38 (C. 2A:6AA-1 et seq.) shall apply.
D. During the pendence of any appeal, the municipality or approving
authority shall continue to process, hear, and decide the application for
development, and to inspect the development in the normal course, and
shall not withhold, delay, or deny reviews, inspections, signing of
subdivision plats or site plans, the reduction or the release of
performance or maintenance guarantees, the issuance of construction
permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other approval or permit
because an appeal has been filed or is pending under this subsection.
The chief financial officer of the municipality may pay charges out of the
appropriate escrow account or deposit for which an appeal has been
filed. If a charge is disallowed after payment, the chief financial officer
of the municipality shall reimburse the deposit or escrow account in the
amount of any such disallowed charge or refund the amount to the
applicant. If a charge is disallowed after payment to a professional or
consultant who is not an employee of the municipality, the professional

the Planning Board and to the Board of Adjustment an index of the natural
resources of the Township (Natural Resources Inventory), the Planning
Board or Board of Adjustment shall make available to the Environmental
Commission an information copy of every application for development

Minor subdivision approval shall be granted or denied within forty
five (45) days of the date of submission of a complete application or

and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other
evidence of approval herein required, and shall be accepted by the
county recording officer for purposes of filing the subdivision. Minor

Final approval shall be granted or denied within forty five (45) days

certificate of the Director of Planning & Engineering or designee as to
the failure of the Planning Board to act shall be issued on request of the
applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement
or other evidence of approval herein required and shall be so accepted
by the county recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats.

§ 132-45. Expiration of Variances.
Any variance from the terms of the zoning ordinance hereafter granted
by the Board of Adjustment, permitting the creation or alteration of any
structure or structures or permitting a specified use of any structure or any
property in a district restricted against such use, shall expire by limitation
unless construction or alteration or use shall have been actively commenced
as permitted by such variance within three (3) years from the date of
adoption of the resolution by the Zoning Board, except as otherwise
provided for by the granting authority; provided, however, that the Zoning
Board is hereby granted the authority to grant a one year extension,
provided that the applicant for such extension shall give prior notice of
this application requesting such extension to those persons entitled thereto
pursuant to Section 11 of this chapter; provided, however, that such period
of limitation herein provided shall be tolled from the date of appeal of the
decision to any court of competent jurisdiction, until the termination in any
manner of such appeal or proceeding.
§ 132-46. Authorized Exceptions and Waivers.
The Board of Adjustment shall render a decision not later than one
hundred twenty (120) days after the date (1) an appeal is taken from the
decision of the Director of Planning & Engineering or designee or (2)
the submission of a complete application for development to the Board
of Adjustment. Failure of the Zoning Board to render a decision within
such one hundred twenty day period or within such further time as may
be consented to by the applicant shall constitute a decision favorable to
the applicant. [Amended 1-25-99 by Ord. No. 99-4]
A. The Board, when acting upon applications for preliminary or minor
subdivision approval or preliminary site plan or modification of such
approvals previously granted, shall have the power to grant such
exceptions from the requirements for subdivision approval or site plan
approval, as the case may be, as may be reasonable and within the
general purpose and intent of the provisions of subdivision and site plan
review and approval, if literal enforcement of one (1) or more provisions
of this chapter is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of

B. Where an applicant desires the Board to waive any requirements of
subdivision or site plan approval, the applicant shall, at the time when it
files its application for development, in writing, designate such
requirement waivers thereof with respect to its particular applications.
The Director of Planning and Engineering or his designee shall review
such request and shall report thereon to the Board with
recommendations. The Board shall review and determine such request
at a public meeting.
C. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Board from granting any
exceptions as described herein at the hearing on the application despite

No. 92-19]
Preliminary approval of a major subdivision pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 291
(C. 40:55D 48) or of a site plan pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 291 (C. 40:55D 46)
shall confer upon the applicant the following rights for a three year period
from the date on which the resolution of preliminary approval is adopted.
the applicant's failure to request such waivers in its application for
development.
D. Nothing contained herein shall relieve the applicant from following all
procedures necessary for the granting of a bulk or use variance, where
applicable.
A. That the general terms and conditions on which preliminary approval
was granted shall not be changed, including but not limited to use
requirements; layout and design standards for streets, curbs and
sidewalks; lot size; yard dimensions and off tract improvements; and, in
the case of a site plan, any requirements peculiar to site plan approval
pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 291 C. 40:55D-41; except, however, that
nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the municipality from
modifying by ordinance such general terms and conditions of
preliminary approval as relate to public health and safety.
B. That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before the
expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or section or sections
of the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan, as the case may be.
C. That the applicant may apply for and the Planning Board may grant
extensions on such preliminary approval for additional periods of at
least one (1) year, but not to exceed a total extension of two (2) years,
provided that if the design standards have been revised by ordinance,
such revised standards may govern.
D. In the case of a subdivision of or site plan for an area of fifty (50) acres
or more, the Planning Board may grant the rights referred to in
Subsections A, B and C above for such period of time, longer than three
(3) years, as shall be determined by the Planning Board to be
reasonable taking into consideration the number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area permissible under preliminary approval,
economic conditions and the comprehensiveness of the development.
The applicant may apply for thereafter and the Planning Board may
thereafter grant an extension of time as shall be determined by the
Planning Board to be reasonable taking into consideration the number
of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible under
preliminary approval, the potential number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area of the section or sections awaiting final
approval, economic conditions and the comprehensiveness of the
development: provided that if the design standards have been revised,
such revised standards may govern.

§ 132-48. Effect of Final Approval. [Amended 6-10-92 by Ord. No.
92-19]
E. Whenever the Planning Board grants an extension of preliminary
approval pursuant to subsection C or D of this section and preliminary
approval has expired before the date on which the extension is granted,
the extension shall begin on what would otherwise be the expiration
date. The developer may apply for the extension either before or after
what would otherwise be the expiration date. [Added 6-10-92 by Ord.
No. 92-19]
F. The Planning Board shall grant an extension of preliminary approval for
a period determined by the Board but not exceeding one year from what
would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the developer was barred or
prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the development
because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly for and
diligently pursued the required approvals. A developer shall apply for
the extension before (1) what would otherwise be the expiration date of
preliminary approval or (2) the 91st day after the developer receives
the last legally required approval from other governmental entities,
whichever occurs later. An extension granted pursuant to this
subsection shall not preclude the Planning Board from granting an
extension pursuant to subsection C and D of this section. [Added
6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
A. Site Plan or Major Subdivision.
1. The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval
first granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer
pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 291 (C. 40:55D 49), whether conditionally
or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of two (2) years
after the date on which the resolution of final approval is adopted;
provided that, in the case of a major subdivision, the rights
conferred by this section shall expire if the plat has not been duly
recorded within the time period provided in section 42 of P.L. 1975,
c. 291 (C. 40:55D 54). If the developer has followed the standards
prescribed for final approval and, in the case of a subdivision, has
duly recorded the plat as required in section 42 of P.L. 1975, c. 291
(C. 40:55D 54), the Planning Board may extend such period of
protection for extensions of one (1) year but not to exceed three (3)
extensions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter,
the granting of final approval terminates the time period of
preliminary approval pursuant to section 37 of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (C.
40:55D 49) for the section granted final approval. [Amended
6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
2. In the case of a subdivision or site plan for a planned unit
development or planned unit residential development or residential
§ 132-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-48
1:341
cluster of fifty (50) acres or more or conventional subdivision or
site plan for one hundred fifty (150) acres or more, the Planning
Board may grant the rights referred to in Subsection A of this
section for such period of time, longer that two (2) years, as shall
be determined by the Planning Board to be reasonable taking into
consideration (1) the number of dwelling units and nonresidential
floor area permissible under final approval, (2) economic conditions
and (3) the comprehensiveness of the development. The developer
may apply for thereafter and the Planning Board may thereafter
grant an extension of final approval for such additional period of
time as shall be determined by the Planning Board to be reasonable
taking into consideration (1) the number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area permissible under final approval, (2) the
number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area remaining
to be developed, (3) economic conditions and (4) the
comprehensiveness of the development.
3. Whenever the Planning Board grants an extension of final approval
pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 of this section and final approval has
expired before the date on which the extension is granted, the
extension shall begin on what would otherwise be the expiration
date. The developer may apply for the extension either before or
after what would otherwise be the expiration date. [Added
6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
4. The Planning Board shall grant an extension of final approval for a
period determined by the Board but not exceeding one year from
what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer
proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the
developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from
proceeding with the development because of delays in obtaining
legally required approvals from other governmental entities and
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued
these approvals. A developer shall apply for the extension before
(1) what would otherwise be the expiration date of final approval or
(2) the 91st day after the developer receives the last legally
required approval from other governmental entities, whichever
occurs later. An extension granted pursuant to this subsection shall
not preclude the Planning Board from granting an extension
pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 of this section. [Added 6-10-92 by
Ord. No. 92-19]
B. Minor Subdivision. [Added 6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
1. Approval of a minor subdivision shall expire 190 days from the date
on which the resolution of municipal approval is adopted unless
within such period a plat in conformity with such approval and the
provisions of the "Map Filing Law," P.L. 1960, c. 141 (C. 46:23-9.9 et
seq.), or a deed clearly describing the approved minor subdivision
is filed by the developer with the county recording officer, the
municipal engineer and the municipal tax assessor. Any such plat or

§ 132-48.1. Submission of Final Plat. [Added 11-12-91 by Ord. No.
91-111; amended 6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
Upon final approval, the final plat shall be signed by the Chairman and
Secretary of the Planning Board, provided that the subdivider has submitted
a final plat reflecting compliance with all conditions and requirements
of final subdivision approval set forth by the Planning Board and further
provided that submission of the final plat for signature by the Chairman and
Secretary of the Planning Board is made within ninety (90) days of the date
of Planning Board approval.
Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from the date
of signing of the plat unless within such period the plat shall have been
duly filed by the developer with the county recording officer. The Planning
Board may for good cause shown extend the period for recording for an
additional period not to exceed 190 days from the date of signing of the
deed accepted for such filing shall have been signed by the
chairman and secretary of the Planning Board.
2. The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions,
whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision
approval was granted, shall not be changed for a period of 2 years
after the date on which the resolution of minor subdivision
approval is adopted; provided the approved minor subdivision shall
have been duly recorded as provided in this chapter.
3. The Board may extend the 190-day period for filing a minor
subdivision plat or deed pursuant to this section if the developer
proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board (1) that the
developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from
filing because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals
from other governmental or quasi-governmental entities and (2)
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the
required approvals, as determined by the Board. The developer
may apply for the extension either before or after what would
otherwise be the expiration date.
4. The Board shall grant an extension of minor subdivision approval
for a period determined by the Board but not exceeding one year
from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer
proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the
developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from
proceeding with the development because of delays in obtaining
legally required approvals from other governmental entities and
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the
required approvals. A developer shall apply for the extension
before (1) what would otherwise be the expiration date of minor
subdivision approval or (2) the 91st day after the developer
receives the last legally required approval from other
governmental entities, whichever occurs later.
§ 132-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-48.1
1:343
plat. The Planning Board may extend the 95-day or 190-day period if the
developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Board (1)
that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from
filing because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental or quasi-governmental entities and (2) that the developer
applied promptly for and diligently pursued the required approvals. The
length of the extension shall be equal to the period of delay caused by the
wait for the required approvals, as determined by the Planning Board. The
developer may apply for an extension either before or after the original
expiration date.
After filing the plat with the County the subdivider shall submit a signed and
sealed translucent tracing and a signed and sealed cloth copy of the plat to
the Department of Planning and Engineering.
At the time the Final Plat is submitted for signatures of Municipal Officials,
the applicant shall submit a CAD-generated data file(s), directly translatable
into an identical image of the File Map, conforming to the following:
Media: The file(s) shall be submitted upon diskette(s), either
5.25"/1.2MG or 3.50"/1.44Mb, formatted for DOS Version 3.31
or later based IBM PC's and PC compatibles. [Amended
6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
Format: The file shall be either:
a. An AutoCAD drawing file (i.e., a "DWG" Extension file)
compatible with AutoCAD Release 11 or later; [Amended
6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
b. An ACSII Drawing Interchange File (i.e. a ".DXF" Extension
file) compatible with AutoCAD Release 11 or later.
[Amended 6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]
At the discretion of the applicant, Department of Planning & Engineering
staff can be requested to do the required conversion to CAD at a fee
in accordance with the Township Fee Schedule contained in Town Code
Section 132-32.
§ 132-49. Compensation for Reserved Lands.
Whenever the East Brunswick Planning or Zoning Board shall reserve the
location and extent of such street, ways, basins or areas shown on a plat
submitted for subdivision or site plan approval, pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-44, the developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual
loss found to be caused by the temporary reservation and deprivation of
use. Unless a lesser amount has previously been mutually agreed upon,
just compensation shall be deemed to be the fair market value of an option
to purchase land reserved for the period of reservation, including but not
limited to the real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved and
prorated for the period of reservation. The developer shall be compensated
for the reasonable increased costs of legal, engineering or other
professional services incurred in connection with obtaining subdivision
§ 132-48.1 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-49
1:344
approval or site plan approval, as the case may be, caused by the
reservation. The township shall obtain an appraisal of the value of the
option from a licensed real estate appraiser and shall disclose the fair
market value of the option to the developer, provided that the developer
shall also obtain a fair market value of the option and disclose the same to
the township. The township shall require verification of increased costs of
legal, engineering or other professional services incurred by the developer.
In the event that the land which is reserved shall be the subject of an
application for state or federal funding, all applicable state and federal laws
and regulations shall govern the timetable which shall be implemented by
the township.
§ 132-50. Conditional Approvals.
§ 132-51. Suspension of Periods of Approval.
In the event that, during the period of approval heretofore or hereafter
granted to an application for development, the developer is barred or
prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the development
otherwise permitted under such approval, by a legal action instituted by
any state agency, political subdivision or other party to protect the public
health or welfare and the developer is otherwise ready, willing and able to
proceed with said development, the running of the period of approval under
this chapter shall be suspended for the period of time said legal action is
pending or such directive or order is in effect.
§ 132-52. Common Open Space Requirements.
A. In the event that a developer submits an application for development
proposing a development that is barred or prevented, directly or
indirectly, by a legal action instituted by any state agency, political
subdivision or any other party to protect the public health and welfare
or be a directive or order issued by any state agency, political
subdivision or court of competent jurisdiction to protect the public
health and welfare, the municipal agency shall process such application
for development in accordance with this chapter, and, if such
application for development complies with the requirements of this
chapter, the approving authority shall approve such application
conditioned on removal of such legal barrier to development.
B. In the event that development proposed by an application for
development requires an approval by a governmental agency other
than the approving authority, the approving authority shall, in
appropriate instances, condition its approval upon the subsequent
approval of such governmental agency, provided that the approving
authority shall make a decision on any application for development
within the time period provided in this chapter or within an extension of
such period as has been agreed to by the applicant, unless the
approving authority is prevented or relieved from so acting by the
operation of law.
§ 132-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-52
1:345
A. Public Ownership.
Common open space shall remain in private ownership, unless the
appropriate Board determines that public ownership is desirable and
unless the subdivider agrees to the necessary land donation, in which
case ownership shall be in the Township of East Brunswick, or in
such other public body as shall be deemed appropriate, provided that
the township or such other public body shall approve such public
ownership. In the event that the Board shall determine that there
shall be public ownership of common open space but the subdivider or
the public body shall not agree to the same or in the event that the
Board shall not approve the form of private ownership of common open
space, the Board may disapprove the application for subdivision with
the reduction in lot area provisions of Article III of the Zoning Chapter.
Standards for the Board determination as to public ownership shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
1. The need for public open space or recreational facilities in the
areas determined by the Township Master Plan.
2. The potential for an open space connection between two (2) public
open space areas.
3. The desirability of public access due to the peculiar physical
characteristics of the area which make it suitable for public open
space uses not otherwise available in that area.
4. Soil or vegetation characteristics of the area that provide a
desirable public wildlife refuge.
All common open space shown on a preliminary plat shall be
included in the first section submitted for final approval. However,
in the case of a subdivision to be developed over a period of years,
the Board may permit the total area proposed for common open
space to be divided among the sections submitted for final plat
approval, in which case the common open space appurtenant to
each such section shall comply with the minimum common open
space requirements as applied to each section.
B. Failure to maintain common open space. In the event that the
organization established to own and maintain common open space, or
any successor organization, shall at any time after its formation fail to
maintain the common open space in reasonable order and condition in
accordance with the approval granted by the Planning Board, the
municipality may serve written notice upon such organization or upon
the residents and owners of the cluster subdivision setting forth the
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common
space in reasonable condition. Said notice shall include a demand that
such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30 days thereof and
shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon, which hearing shall
be held within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing, the municipality
may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and
§ 132-52 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-52
1:346
§ 132-53. Performance and Maintenance Guarantees. [Amended
6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19; 5-10-93 by Ord. No. 93-21; 10-2-95 by
Ord. No. 95-34; 12-9-2019 by Ord. No. 19-36]
may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured. If
the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modifications
thereof shall not be cured within 30 days or any extension thereof, the
municipality, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties
within the cluster subdivision and to prevent the common open space
from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open
space and maintain the same for a period of one year. Said entry
and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common open space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to
the public by the residents and owners. Before the expiration of said
year, the municipality shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of
the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the
common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such
organization or to the residents and owners of the cluster subdivision,
to be held by the Health Officer, at which hearing such organization or
the residents and owners of the cluster subdivision shall show cause
why such maintenance by the municipality shall not, at the election of
the municipality, continue for a succeeding year. If the Health Officer
shall determine that such organization is not ready and able to maintain
said common open space in a reasonable condition, the municipality
may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said common open space
during the next succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing
and determination, in each year thereafter. The decision of the Health
Officer in any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision
subject to judicial review. The cost of such maintenance by the
municipality shall be assessed ratably against the properties within the
cluster subdivision that have a right of enjoyment of the common open
space and shall become a tax lien on said properties. The municipality,
at the time of entering upon said common open space for the purpose
of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the office of the County
Clerk upon the properties affected by such lien within the cluster
subdivision.
A. Before recording final subdivision plats or recording of minor
subdivision deeds or as a condition of a final site plan approval or as a
condition to the issuance of a zoning permit pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-65, the Township may require and shall accept, in accordance
with the standards adopted herein, for the purpose of assuring the
installation and maintenance of certain on-tract public improvements:
(1) Performance guarantee required.
(a) The furnishing of a performance guarantee in favor of the
Township of East Brunswick in an amount equal to 120% of the
cost of only those improvements required by an approval or
developer's agreement, ordinance, or regulation to be
§ 132-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-53
1:347
dedicated to a public entity, and that have not yet been
installed, which cost shall be determined by the developer
and approved by the Municipal Engineer, according to the
method of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4, for
the following improvements as shown on the approved plans
or plat: streets, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks,
streetlighting, street trees, surveyor's monuments, as shown
on the final map and required by the Map Filing Law, P.L.
1960, c. 141,8 water mains, sanitary sewers, community septic
systems, drainage structures, public improvements of open
space, and any grading necessitated by the preceding
improvements.
(b) The performance guarantee may also be required to include, at
the discretion of the Township, a guarantee for the installation
of privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping. A separate
performance guarantee, if required, shall be posted for the
privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping or may be
included in the performance guarantee for the bonded public
improvements. The developer shall prepare an itemized cost
estimate of the improvements covered by the performance
guarantee for review and approval by the Municipal Engineer,
which improvements shall be appended to each performance
guarantee posted by the obligor.
(2) The furnishing of a safety and stabilization guarantee in favor of
the Township of East Brunswick to ensure that the Township has an
adequate guarantee to return the property that has been disturbed
to a safe and stable condition or otherwise implement measures to
protect the public from access to an unsafe or unstable condition.
The Township shall be permitted to access the guarantee when site
disturbance has commenced and, thereafter, all work on the
development has ceased for a period of at least 60 consecutive days
following such commencement for reasons other than force
majeure, and work has not recommenced within 30 days following
the provision of written notice by the Township to the developer of
the Township's intent to claim payment under the guarantee. At the
developer's option, the safety and stabilization guarantee may be
included as a line item for safety and stabilization in the
performance guarantee rather than in the form of a separate
guarantee. The amount of the safety and stabilization guarantee
shall be calculated pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as follows:
(a) $5,000 for the first $100,000 of bonded improvement costs;
plus
(b) 2.5% of bonded improvement costs in excess of $100,000 up to
$1,000,000; plus
8. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 46:26b-1 et seq.
§ 132-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-53
1:348
(c) 1% of bonded improvement costs in excess of $1,000,000.
B. Form of guarantee.
(1) The performance guarantees shall consist of cash or a certified
check for not more than 10% of the estimated cost of the
improvements, and the balance of the cost shall be evidenced by a
corporate surety performance bond issued by a corporation
authorized to issue bonds in the State of New Jersey. If the
developer chooses, the entire amount may be posted with the
Township in cash.
(2) The approving authority shall, for the purposes of Section 41 of P.L.
1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a), accept a performance
guarantee or maintenance guarantee which is an irrevocable letter
of credit if it:
(a) Constitutes an unconditional payment obligation of the issuer
running solely to the municipality for an express initial period
of time in the amount determined pursuant to Section 41 of P.L.
1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53);
(b) Is issued by a banking or savings institution authorized to do
and doing business in this state with an AA rating;
(c) Is for a period of time of at least one year; and
(d) Permits the municipality to draw upon the letter of credit by
certifying abandonment (default) of the project by passing of a
resolution of the governing body or if the obligor fails to
furnish another letter of credit which complies with the
provisions of this section 30 days or more in advance of the
expiration date of the letter of credit or such longer period in
advance thereof as is stated in the letter of credit.
(3) The performance guarantees shall be approved by the Municipal
Attorney as to form, sufficiency and execution. The letter of credit
shall be approved by the Township Finance Officer.
C. The time allowed for installation of the bonded improvements for which
the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the
governing body by resolution. As a condition or part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guarantee shall be increased
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the
cost of the installation as determined by the developer and approved by
the Municipal Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth
in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the resolution.
D. If the required bonded improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Township for the reasonable cost of
the improvements not completed or corrected, and the Township may,
§ 132-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-53
1:349
either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete
such improvements.
E. Approved bonded improvements.
(1) Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements
(except for the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements
and the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may
notify the governing body, in writing, by certified mail addressed in
care of the Municipal Clerk, of the completion or substantial
completion of bonded improvements and shall send a copy thereof
to the Municipal Engineer. The request shall indicate which bonded
improvements have been completed and which bonded
improvements remain uncompleted in the judgment of the obligor.
Thereupon, the Municipal Engineer shall inspect all bonded
improvements of which such notice has been given and shall file a
detailed report, in writing, with the governing body, and shall
simultaneously send a copy thereof to the obligor not later than 45
days after receipt of the obligor's request, indicating either
approval, partial approval or rejection of such improvements, with
a statement of reasons for any rejection. The report shall identify
each bonded improvement determined to be completed and
satisfactory, together with a recommendation as to the amount of
reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the
completed and satisfactory bonded improvement, in accordance
with the previously prepared itemized cost estimate.
(2) The Municipal Engineer shall schedule a public hearing, to be held
at 8:00 p.m. on a weekday. The Municipal Engineer shall inform the
obligor or developer of the date of the hearing, and the obligor or
developer shall be required to provide notice of at least 15 days by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to all owners of land within
the subdivision that there will be a public hearing concerning the
public improvements covered by the performance guarantee. The
notice will specify whether the obligor or developer seeks to
release the performance guarantees. The obligor or developer shall
cause to be published a notice of the public hearing in a newspaper
circulated within the Township of East Brunswick, said publication
to be at least 10 days prior to the date of the proposed hearing. The
hearing shall be conducted by the Municipal Engineer. The obligor
or developer and its engineer are required to be present. At the
hearing, members of the public shall be afforded the right to speak
with regard to the public improvements. A list of concerns
expressed by the homeowners shall be made part of a punch list to
be included in a detailed report which the Municipal Engineer shall
file, in writing, with the governing body. Following the inspection of
the improvements by the Municipal Engineer and the public
hearing, the Municipal Engineer will include in his report to the
governing body a recommendation indicating either approval,
partial approval or rejection of such improvements, with a
§ 132-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-53
1:350
statement of reasons for any rejection. The cost of the
improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth by the
Municipal Engineer. Included within the report will be a synopsis
of the public hearing.
(3) The governing body, by resolution, shall either approve the bonded
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
Municipal Engineer or reject any or all of these bonded
improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for
rejection and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction
to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the
improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared by the Municipal Engineer and appended to the
performance guarantee. This resolution shall be adopted not later
than 45 days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the
Municipal Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the
governing body, the obligor shall be released from all liability
pursuant to its performance guarantee with respect to those
approved bonded improvements, except for that portion adequately
sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements
not yet approved, provided that 30% of the amount of the total
performance guarantee and safety and stabilization guarantee
posted may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of
all improvements. The safety and stabilization guarantee shall be
reduced by the same percentage as the performance guarantee is
being reduced at the time of each performance guarantee
reduction.
(4) For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to
its performance guarantee, the amount of the performance
guarantee attributable to each approved bonded improvement
shall be reduced by the total amount for each such improvement, in
accordance with the itemized cost estimate which formed the basis
of the performance guarantee, and appended to the performance
guarantee pursuant to Subsection A of this section, including any
contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of
the approved bonded improvements would exceed 70% of the total
amount of the performance guarantee, then the municipality may
retain 30% of the amount of the total performance guarantee and
safety and stabilization guarantee to ensure completion and
acceptability of bonded improvements, as provided above.
F. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and
upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
G. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
governing body or the Municipal Engineer.
§ 132-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-53
1:351
H. If the governing body fails to approve or reject the improvements
determined by the Municipal Engineer to be complete and satisfactory
or reduce the performance guarantee for the complete and satisfactory
improvements within 45 days from the receipt of the Municipal
Engineer's list and report, the obligor may apply to the court in a
summary manner for an order compelling, within a stated time,
approval of the complete and satisfactory improvements in accordance
with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the Municipal Engineer
and appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to Subsection A.
of this section; and the cost of applying to the court, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party.
I. Inspection fees.
(1) The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Municipal Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of the improvements, which fees shall not exceed the
sum of the amount set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53. The municipality
may require the developer to post the inspection fees in escrow in
an amount calculated as follows: except for extraordinary
circumstances, the greater of $500 or 5% of the cost of
improvements subject to a performance guarantee, plus an amount
not to exceed 5% of the cost of private site improvements not
subject to a performance guarantee, which cost shall be
determined pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. If the inspection fees
required are less than $10,000, the developer shall have the option
of paying same in two equal installments with the initial amount
deposited to be 50% of the inspection fees. When the balance of
inspections fees on deposit reaches 10%, the remaining installment
shall be due and payable. If the inspection fees required are
$10,000 or greater, the developer shall have the option of paying
same in up to four installments with the initial amount deposited to
be 25% of the inspection fees. When the balance of inspection fees
on deposit reaches 10%, the developer shall make additional
deposits of 25% of the inspection fees.
(2) If the Township determines that the amount in escrow for the
payment of inspection fees, as calculated herein, is insufficient to
cover the cost of additional required inspections, the Township may
require the developer to deposit additional funds in escrow,
provided that the Township delivers to the developer a written
inspection escrow deposit request, prepared by the Municipal
Engineer, which informs the developer of the need for additional
inspections, details the items or undertakings that require
inspections, estimates the time required for those inspections, and
estimates the cost of performing those inspections.
(3) In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of
development pursuant to Subsection (a) of Section 29 of the
Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38), the provisions of this
section shall be applied by stage or section.
§ 132-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-53
1:352
J. If the property or any part of same is sold or otherwise conveyed to a
successor developer prior to the completion and acceptance of all
improvements, an assignment of developer's agreement and new
performance, maintenance or other guarantees shall be required from
the new owner or successor developer. Upon the transfer of ownership
of property that is the subject of a construction permit, and prior to
beginning or continuing work authorized by the construction permit,
the new owner or successor developer shall file with the Building
Department an application for a permit update to notify the Building
Department of the name and address of the new owner or successor
developer and of all other changes to information previously submitted
to the Building Department. The Building Department shall not approve
the application for a permit update until it receives notification from the
governing body, or its designee, that the new owner or successor
developer has furnished adequate replacement performance,
maintenance or other guarantees and assignment of developer's
agreement.
K. Dedicated improvements. To the extent that any of the improvements
have been dedicated to the municipality on the subdivision plat or site
plan, the municipal governing body shall be deemed, upon the release
of any performance guarantee required pursuant to this chapter, to
accept dedication for public use of streets or roads and any other
improvements made thereof according to site plans and subdivision
plats approved by the approving authority, provided that such
improvements have been inspected and have received final approval by
the Municipal Engineer. Prior to acceptance, the developer shall be
responsible for all maintenance of improvements, including streets and
roads, streetlighting, snow plowing, curbs and sidewalks, waterlines,
storm sewers and any other improvements which were installed.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve the developer of the obligation to
post maintenance guarantees in accordance with all requirements.
L. Maintenance guarantee.
(1) Upon completion of all the improvements in a good and
workmanlike manner and in accordance with all rules, regulations,
standards, specifications and ordinances of the Township and the
filing of as-built drawings, the Township will accept the
improvements subject to the deposit and posting of maintenance
guarantees in an amount equal to 15% of the estimated cost of
construction, which cost shall be determined by the Municipal
Engineer. The security for maintenance shall be held by the
municipality in accordance with an escrow agreement similar to
the escrow agreement referred to above. Maintenance guarantees
shall be approved by the Municipal Attorney as to form, sufficiency
and execution, and such guarantee shall run for a period of two
years. Under no circumstances shall the Township pay or be liable
for any interest on any funds deposited with the Township as a
performance or maintenance guarantee.

9-26-05 by Ord. No. 05-29]
(2) No maintenance bond shall be accepted for any item that has
further stages of work or which will need to be altered or reworked.
M. Uncompleted improvements. If, in the event of inclement weather or
construction delays not occasioned by any act of the developer,
subdivider, builder, or successor, it shall be impossible to install the
required sidewalks, streetlighting, surveyors' monuments, shade trees
and landscaping at the time that a certificate of occupancy is applied
for, the applicant shall furnish the Director of Planning and Engineering
with an acknowledgment executed by the prospective home buyer
setting forth the improvements or portions thereof that are not as yet
installed and that the home buyer is agreeable to taking title and
possession of the dwelling in that condition in reliance upon the
existing performance guarantees posted pursuant hereto and the terms
and provisions of this subsection. Should those uncompleted
improvements referred to above not be installed within six months after
the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the Township
Council of the Township of East Brunswick, upon the recommendation
of the Municipal Engineer, may authorize, by resolution, that the
performance guarantees posted pursuant hereto be utilized by the
Township of East Brunswick for the purpose of installing such
uncompleted improvements.
A. Prior to construction of any of the improvements referred to above
specifically, the commencement of any preparatory site work, including,
but not limited to, clearance of the property, grading or excavation or
the signing of the final subdivision or site plan, whichever occurs first,
the developer shall deposit with the Township a sum equal to 5% of the
cost of the improvements, but not more than $4,999, which shall be
used to pay the costs of inspection and testing fees incurred by the
Township. In the event that the costs of inspection and testing are less
than the amount deposited, the balance shall be refunded to the
subdivider. If the costs are greater than the amount deposited, the
Township shall require additional deposits as necessary. The following
fee schedule shall be charged:
1. Township employees.

fees
B. For those subdivision and site plans for which the reasonably
anticipated fees are less than $10,000, fees may, at the option of the
developer, be paid in two installments. The initial amount deposited by
a developer shall be 50% of the reasonably anticipated fees. When the
balance on deposit drops to 10% of the reasonably anticipated fees
because the amount deposited by the developer has been reduced by
the amount paid to the Municipal Engineer for inspection, the
developer shall deposit the remaining 50% of the anticipated inspection
fees. For those developments for which the reasonably anticipated fees
are $10,000 or greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid
in four installments. The initial amount deposited by a developer shall
be 25% of the reasonably anticipated fees. When the balance on deposit
drops to 10% of the reasonably anticipated fees because the amount
deposited by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the
Municipal Engineer for inspection, the developer shall make additional
deposits of 25% of the reasonably anticipated fees. The Municipal
Engineer shall not permit any construction requiring inspection if
sufficient funds to pay for those inspections are not on deposit.
C. Construction within Township right-of-way: A right-of-way permit shall
be required for all construction work located within the Township rightof-
way, including sidewalks, curb aprons and curbs adjacent to

A. A developer, as a condition for approval of a subdivision or site plan, in
accordance with N.J.R.S. 40:55D-42, shall be required to pay only his
pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary street
improvements and water, sewerage and drainage facilities and
easements therefor, located outside the property limits of the
subdivision or development but necessitated or required by
construction or improvements within such subdivision or development.
The pro rata share shall be determined by analyzing the circulation plan
element of the East Brunswick Master Plan showing the location and
types of facilities for all modes of transportation required for the
efficient movement of people and goods into, about and through the
municipality, as well as the utility service plan element of the East
Brunswick Master Plan analyzing the need for and showing the future
general location of water supply and distribution facilities, drainage
and flood control facilities, sewage and waste treatment, solid waste
disposal and provision for other related utilities. Consideration shall be
given by the Planning Board to the question of whether or not the need
for the off-tract improvement was created by the proposed development
of land and whether the required improvement not only benefits the
developer's tract but other properties as well. The Board shall also
determine the related common area which is to be serviced or benefited
by the facilities or improvements required.
§ 132-54 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-55
1:359
The developer shall be required to pay the difference between the
cost of the off-tract improvement and the total amount by which all
properties served thereby, including the developer's property, have
been specifically benefited by the improvement. Further, if the off-tract
improvement is to be constructed by the municipality as a general
improvement or if the improvement is to be constructed by a developer
with a provision for later reimbursement by the municipality, then
the developer shall not be charged with the amount by which the
developer's property was specially benefited by the improvement. In
the event that the municipality shall construct the off-tract
improvement as a local improvement under N.J.R.S. 40:56-1 et seq.,
the developer may be called upon to pay, in addition to the amount set
forth above, the amount by which the subject property was specially
benefited by the improvement.
B. Prior to the Board making a determination of the amount to be paid by
the developer, the governing body shall make a determination whether
the off-tract improvement is to be constructed by the municipality as a
general improvement or as a local improvement or whether it is to be
done by the developer with a formula providing for partial
reimbursement if the improvement specially benefits properties other
than the subdivision. Once that decision has been made, the Planning
Board shall be required to estimate, with the aid of the Municipal
Engineer, the Director of Finance and the Board of Special Assessments
the cost of the improvement and the amount by which all properties to
be serviced thereby, including the subject property, will be specially
benefited therefrom.
C. When the foregoing has been determined, the developer shall be
required to provide, as a condition for approval of his subdivision or site
plan application, a bond, or a cash deposit in lieu thereof, not exceeding
ten percent (10%) of the cost of the improvements, as determined by
the Planning Board, to ensure payment to the municipality of one (1) of
the following amounts:
1. If the improvement is to be constructed by the municipality as a
general improvement, an amount equal to the difference between
the estimated cost of the improvement and the estimated total
amount by which all properties to be serviced thereby, including
the subject property, will be specially benefited by the
improvement.
2. If the improvement is to be constructed by the municipality as a
local improvement, then, in addition to the amount referred to in
Subsection C(1), the estimated amount by which the subject
property will be specially benefited by the improvement.
3. If the improvement is to be constructed by the developer, an
amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvement.

application for development pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 291 (C. 40:55D-1
et seq.) the installation of street lighting on a dedicated public street
connected to a public utility, then upon notification in writing by the
developer to the approving authority and governing body of the municipality
that (1) the street lighting on a dedicated public street has been installed
and accepted for service by the public utility and (2) that certificates of
occupancy have been issued for at least 50% of the dwelling units and
50% of the floor area of the nonresidential uses on the dedicated public
street or portion thereof indicated by section pursuant to section 29 of
P.L. 1975, c. 291 (C. 40:55D-38), the municipality shall within 30 days
following receipt of the notification, make appropriate arrangements with
the public utility for, and assume the payment of, the costs of the street
lighting on the dedicated public street on a continuing basis. Compliance by
the municipality with the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to
constitute acceptance of the street by the municipality.

redetermined to the end that the developer will be required to pay his
appropriate share of the cost thereof.
E. The standards set forth above shall not be altered subsequent to
preliminary approval by a developer.
F. Where a developer pays the amount determined as his pro rata share
under protest, he shall institute legal action within one (1) year of such
payment in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to
the fairness and reasonableness of such amount, in accordance with
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42.
A. Building Permits. No building permit shall be issued by the
Construction Official until final approval has been granted to the
application for development.
B. At the time of issuance of any building permit, the building code official
will provide written instruction on proper disposal and recycling of
construction and demolition waste and furnish a Notification of
Construction/Demolition Activity Form. The Form must be filled out by
the permittee and faxed to the Middlesex County Division of Solid
Waste Management (MCDSWM) within 48 hours of the issuance of a
municipal permit. [Added 11-19-07 by Ord. No. 07-25]
C. Building Lots to Abut Street. No permit for the erection of a building or
structure shall be issued unless the lot abuts a street giving access to
such proposed building or structure. Such lot shall be on an existing
state, county or municipal street or highway or on a street shown upon
§ 132-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-56
1:361
a plat approved by the appropriate Board or on a street on a plat duly
filed in the office of a county recording officer prior to the passage
of an ordinance under this chapter or any prior law which required
prior approval of plats by the governing body or other authorized body.
Before any such permit shall be issued, such street shall have been
certified to be suitably improved to the satisfaction of the Township
Council or such suitable improvement shall have been assured by
means of a performance guarantee, in accordance with standards and
specifications for road improvement approved by the Township Council
as adequate in respect to the public health, safety and general welfare
of a special circumstance of the particular street. [Amended 11-19-07
by Ord. No. 07-25]
D. No building permits shall be issued by the Chief Construction Official
for any home in a subdivision until final subdivision approval has been
granted by the Planning Board. [Amended 2-11-91 by Ord. No.
91-17; 11-19-07 by Ord. No. 07-25]
E. Conditional building permits. In the event that the Planning Board
requires any correction or revision of the site plan, no building shall be
issued a permit until the applicant has submitted a site plan corrected
or revised in accordance with the decision of the Planning Board;
provided, however, that the Chief Construction Official may, in his
discretion, when a written request for modification has been submitted
by the applicant, issue a conditional building permit, after the applicant
has received site plan approval by the Planning Board but before the

construction is not granted.
(2) That the applicant shall proceed at his own risk with the building
operation and without assurance that a permit for the entire
structure will be granted.
(3) That permission to proceed with partial construction shall not be
construed as authority to violate, cancel or set aside any of the
provisions of the Code of the township, except as stipulated by
modification or legally granted variation as described in approvals
by township agencies.
(4) That such conditional building permit shall be valid for a period of
three (3) months from the date of issuance and shall not be

The Construction Official may issue a conditional building permit to any
applicant who has received site plan or subdivision approval, but who has
not yet submitted the completed revisions or corrections of the plats, plans
and requisite documents, upon a showing by such applicant, in writing, that
the failure to issue a building permit before such revisions and corrections

subject property or that other extenuating conditions exist which warrant
the issuance of a conditional building permit. Such conditional building
permit shall be valid for a period of three (3) months from the date of
issuance and shall not be renewed. At the expiration of such period,
construction shall cease until such time as the applicant shall obtain a

1:363
C. No certificate of occupancy for any land or structure shall be granted
until all required improvements or conditions of approval have been
met, installed or completed. A temporary certificate of occupancy may
be issued but only for a specific period, upon such conditions as the
Township Engineer may impose, such as bonding, to ensure the
completion or installation of any such improvements unfinished
because of weather or unforeseen delay. The installation of any
required public or private improvements or improvements required as
conditions of site plan approval may also be delayed if the Township
Engineer warrants in writing to the Construction Official that the delay
is in the best interests of the Township.
D. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the Chief Construction
Official for any home in a subdivision until all the public improvements
in the phase or section in which the certificate of occupancy is being
requested (except for final paving course) are installed and the home is
connected to all the utilities in accordance with the township
regulations. This subsection shall apply in addition to any other
requirements set forth in the building codes and any other Township
ordinances relating to certificates of occupancy. Issuance of a

act of misfeasance by the issuing officer. [Amended 11-12-91 by Ord.
No. 91-111; 6-10-92 by Ord. No. 92-19]

storm sewers, culverts, underground electrical and telephone conduits,
street grading, curbs and street pavement (except for the final paving
course) have not been installed in front of or on the building site or to
the rear of the building site, shall be a violation, by the subdivider or
seller and the purchaser or occupant, of this chapter. A subdivider or
seller or an occupant or purchaser found guilty of violating this
subsection shall be subject to a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars
($500.) or imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both.
F. During the period from late fall to early spring or at any other times of
the year, it may not be feasible to install landscaping and minor
construction details required by site plan approval due to inclement
weather, unavailability of material or other reasons. The Director of
Planning & Engineering may authorize the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy where landscaping is not installed or minor construction
details are not complete, provided that a cash deposit sufficient to
accomplish all uncompleted work set forth on the site plan is posted
with the Township of East Brunswick. The Director of Planning and
Engineering will exercise his or her decision based on the following
standards [Added 4-20-09 by Ord. No. 09-11]
(a) That the applicant would suffer severe financial loss unless a
certificate of occupancy is issued and that a temporary certificate
of occupancy would not suffice.
§ 132-58 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-58
1:364
§ 132-58.1. Display of Certain Maps and Plans By Subdividers.
[Added 11-12-91 by Ord. No. 91-111]
(b) That the construction is of a minor nature, meaning it does not
make up a large cost item in the overall site plan, and that the site
can be used with the minor item omitted without endangering the
health and welfare of the public or those using the premises.
(c) That the weather conditions will make it unlikely that the
landscaping, given all reasonable care, would survive.
(d) That the sum deposited shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the
cost of completing the work to be done, not to exceed 120% of the
cost of installation, as estimated by the Township Engineer in
accordance with the Municipal Land Use Law.
(e) That the construction or the permanence of the construction would
be jeopardized by the existing weather conditions.
(f) The sum deposited as escrow shall also include an amount
sufficient to cover the cost of all inspections and tests which are
required in connection with the construction or installation of all
public improvements and all work required by site plan approval
but not completed at the time the certificate of occupancy is issued.
In addition, the Director of Planning & Engineering or his or her
designee(s) shall estimate the amount necessary to cover the pro
rata share of the cost of providing reasonable protection for offtract
impact caused by site work on the subject premises, which
escrow shall be released at such time as the Director of Planning &
Engineering or his or her designee(s) is satisfied that the site has
been constructed in such a way so as to protect against such offtract
impact.
G. The applicant must also execute an agreement to complete the work as
soon as weather permits and in no instance after more than one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the application. Failure to
complete the work within one hundred eighty (180) days shall
constitute sufficient authorization for the Director of Planning and
Engineering to utilize the cash deposit and have all work completed as
shown on the approved site plan. [Added 4-20-09 by Ord. No. 09-11]

household recertification, acceleration of all sums due under a

regulations, entry on the premises, and specific performance.
B. After providing written notice of a violation to an Owner, Developer or

Developer or Tenant of the penalties for such violations, the
municipality may take the following action against the Owner,
Developer or Tenant for any violation that remains uncured for a period
of 60 days after service of the written notice:
1. The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation, or violations, of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the Owner, Developer or
Tenant is found by the court to have violated any provision of the
regulations governing affordable housing units the Owner,
Developer or Tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the court:
a. In the case of an Owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment into the East Brunswick
Township Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount
of rent illegally collected;
b. In the case of an Owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's
reasonable relocation costs, as determined by the court.
2. The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment, which would result in the termination of the
Owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as if the
same were a judgment of default of the First Purchase Money
Mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- and moderateincome
unit.
C. Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality,
by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which time the low- and
moderate-income unit of the violating Owner shall be sold at a sale
price which is not less than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and
pay off any First Purchase Money Mortgage and prior liens and the
costs of the enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating Owner shall have the right to
possession terminated as well as the title conveyed pursuant to the
Sheriff's sale.
D. The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the
First Purchase Money Mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the lowand
moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to
§ 132-83 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 132-83
1:396
reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with either the court action resulting in the judgment of
violation or the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the
Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating Owner shall be personally responsible for and
to the extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred
by the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In
the event that a surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such
surplus, if any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the
Owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two
years or until such earlier time as the Owner shall make a claim with
the municipality for such. Failure of the Owner to claim such balance
within the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of
such balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned on
such balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be
paid to the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the
Owner or forfeited to the municipality.
E. Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions
of the regulations governing affordable housing units as the same apply
to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the
purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The Owner
determined to be in violation of the provisions of this plan and from
whom title and possession were taken by means of the Sheriff's sale
shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
F. If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts
are bid to satisfy the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any prior
liens, the municipality may acquire title to the low- and moderateincome
unit by satisfying the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any
prior liens and crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to
the difference between the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any
prior liens and costs of the enforcement proceedings, including legal
fees and the maximum resale price for which the low- and moderateincome
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the
same manner as the excess which would have been realized from an
actual sale as previously described.
G. Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the
Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the Owner
to accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser which may
be referred to the Owner by the municipality, with such offer to
purchase being equal to the maximum resale price of the low- and
moderate-income unit as permitted by the regulations governing
affordable housing units.

1:397
§ 132-83.1. Reporting and Monitoring Requirements.

As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BASIC WRECKER LICENSE  Required of all wrecker operators who are
based within the Township of East Brunswick. Also required of all out-oftown
wrecker operators who wish to be called by the police department for
"customer requests." The Basic Wrecker License also entitles an operator
who qualifies for fatal accident wrecker response, as determined pursuant
to the Middlesex County Prosecutor's guidelines, to be called by the police
department for fatal and potentially fatal accidents.
BUSINESS LOCATION  A base of operation that is staffed during normal
business hours every weekday and Saturdays, excluding holidays. The
business must be clearly marked with signs identifying the name of the
business and the hours of operation. The Business Location must include a
fenced-in lot for the storage of towed vehicles, and must meet the location
requirements set forth in § 135-50A and § 135-50B, as applicable. In lieu
of a fence, a well-lit storage lot which can be observed by passing patrol
cars is acceptable. However, if the Traffic Division Commander determines
at any time that the security of the lot is inadequate, he may require the
installation of a security fence and/or additional lighting in order for the
operator to maintain a Police Tow List Wrecker License.
CLEAN-UP  Removal and/or disposal of any debris left on the roadway or
property as a result of a motor vehicle accident or recovery.
CRUISING  Driving a wrecker along a public highway at a slow speed or

have registered gross vehicle weights in excess of 10,000 pounds.
POLICE TOW LIST WRECKER LICENSE  Entitles a wrecker operator to
be placed on the rotational Police Tow List.
OPERATOR  Anyone who engages in the business of operating a wrecker
or heavy wrecker. It is not necessary that the vehicle used is owned by the
operator. A person who leases, borrows or otherwise obtains a wrecker or
heavy wrecker shall be considered an "operator." However, the term does
not include a person hired by another to drive a wrecker or heavy wrecker.
WRECKER  A vehicle used to tow or remove other vehicles usually so
damaged or disabled that they cannot proceed under their own power. It
also refers to the operator of a wrecker as defined herein.

Wrecker License for a heavy wrecker, an operator's Business Location,
including the storage yard, shall be located in East Brunswick
Township, or immediately adjacent thereto, in order to ensure response
time, as required by § 135-51B.
A. Assignment of Services: Towing services are assigned to Police Tow List
wrecker operators on a rotational basis. However, when a need arises
for an expeditious tow, the nearest licensed wrecker operator may be
called. If the operator is on the rotational tow list, the call shall count as
the operator's next turn. Subsequent wrecker requests shall be
assigned to the operators who were skipped. When a motorist requests
a specific wrecker operator ("customer request"), and the operator is
licensed to tow in the township, the requested operator shall be called.
If the requested wrecker operator is on the rotational tow list, the call
shall count as the operator's next turn. Police tow logs shall be available
for inspection by any licensed operator during regular business hours.
B. Response Time: From the time of dispatch by police headquarters,
wreckers shall arrive on the scene within the following time limits:
Regular
Wrecker
8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. 15 minutes
6:01 p.m. to 7:59 a.m. 20 minutes
Heavy Wrecker 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. 20 minutes
601: p.m. to 7:59 a.m. 30 minutes
When a Police Tow List wrecker operator's response time exceeds the
time limits, the wrecker shall be canceled and the operator shall lose
his turn on the rotational tow list. The next operator on the Police Tow
List shall then be dispatched. Prevailing weather and road conditions
should be considered prior to canceling a wrecker for excessive
response time. In addition to losing their turn on the rotational tow
list, Police Tow List wrecker operators who exceed the response time
limits shall be subject to the penalties set forth in § 135-56B for each
violation. When a Basic Wrecker License operator exceeds the response
time limits, the wrecker shall be canceled and the next wrecker on the
Police Tow List shall be dispatched. Basic Wrecker License operators
shall be subject to license revocation in accordance with § 135-8 if
they exceed the response time limits more than five (5) times in any
calendar year. All Police Tow List wrecker operators must provide
24-hour, 7-day service. In addition, they must respond to a minimum
of 80% of their calls each month. The Traffic Division will monitor

criminal arrest, etc., shall be taken immediately to the operator's
Business Location unless the vehicle driver or the police request
otherwise. Vehicles shall be locked and parked in the secure area of the
operator's Business Location. If any of the vehicle's windows are
broken, a tarp or other non-porous material shall be applied to protect
the vehicle's interior from the elements.
D. Police Holds: If a police officer requests a "police hold" on a vehicle, a
"police hold" card shall be completed by the officer and given to the
wrecker driver at the time of the tow. The "police hold" card shall be
attached to the vehicle's rear view mirror to prevent its unauthorized
release. The only reason for a "police hold" shall be for further police
investigation. All "police hold" vehicles should be towed directly to the
police impound as a "contract tow." However, if a vehicle must first be
towed to police headquarters for processing and/or evidence removal,
the contract tow operator shall comply. He shall then be entitled to two
tow fees, one to police headquarters and one to the police impound.
E. Conditional Release: A "conditional release" card shall be used to
indicate that a vehicle may be released provided certain conditions are
met. For example, a vehicle that was towed because the driver was
revoked or unlicensed may be released to a licensed driver. A vehicle
that was towed because it was uninsured or unregistered may be

owner pays the wrecker operator the towing and storage costs,
the vehicle will be released. However, if the owner decides that
he no longer wants the vehicle, he must sign the title over to
the township. The towing and storage fees will be listed as the
minimum bid for the vehicle, which will be sold by the township
at the next auction. If the owner fails to respond to the registered
letter, the township will apply to the DMV for title and sell the
vehicle at the next auction. The towing and storage fees will be
listed as the minimum bid.

Brunswick-based operator's property shall conform to the sketch

excess of the amount specified in this section when unusual difficulties
and/or distances are involved. Such agreements shall be without

additional charge for towing a vehicle to any location within East
Brunswick Township. If a wrecker operator is based outside East
Brunswick Township, there shall be no additional charge for towing a
vehicle to the operator's Business Location. If a motorist requests to

Middlesex County, and the wrecker operator is able to comply with the
request, the charge shall be three dollars ($3.00) per mile for every mile
beyond the boundaries of East Brunswick, regardless of the time of day.
The motorist is responsible for negotiating the terms of a tow beyond
the boundaries of Middlesex County. No driver or owner of a wrecker

other than the established or agreed-upon fee for towing a disabled
vehicle. No operator shall refuse to accept Master Card, Visa or cash as
payment for services.

A. Upon receipt of an application completed pursuant to this chapter, the
Municipal Clerk shall refer such application to the Chief of Police, who
shall make an investigation of the prospective licensee, pursuant to this
chapter for the purpose of determining the suitability of the applicant
for licensing. The investigation shall include, but shall not be limited to
the following:
(1) The experience of the applicant in the business of purchase and
sale of those articles or goods referred to in § 135-57, although
nothing in this section shall be construed to warrant denial of a
license solely on the basis of lack of experience;
(2) The reputation of the applicant for fair dealing in the community,
which shall be made among credible sources, which sources shall
be disclosed to the applicant in the event of a denial of any license;
(3) Any criminal record of the applicant including any past convictions
for any crime(s), disorderly persons offense(s), or municipal
ordinance violation(s) within this or any other jurisdiction. The
Chief of Police shall, as part of the initial application process,
require a fingerprint criminal background check through the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information
Services Division, this will require an additional fee from the
applicant and shall submit to the same on a triennial basis
thereafter. The applicant shall voluntarily furnish the results of the
fingerprint criminal background check to the officer assigned to
conduct the background investigation. Renewal applications do not
require a fingerprint criminal background check, unless the
triennial year after original application.
(4) The type of operation contemplated to be conducted by the
applicant, particularly whether the business is to be operated from
a fixed location, whether it is to be conducted from a location
primarily devoted to the purchase and sale of precious metal or
other secondhand goods, and other factors bearing on whether the
licensed business will be of a fixed and permanent nature. This
section shall not be construed to require denial of any license solely
on the grounds that the business is not from a fixed location or that
the applicant is a transient buyer or itinerant business, however
applicants who fall under the category of a transient buyer or
itinerant business must state with specificity on the license
application the business address where transaction records
required by § 135-61D of this chapter will be stored as well as the

in writing within ten (10) days of such denial and the Clerk shall
forward to the applicant a statement of the reason or reasons for such
denial.
D. Grounds for recommending denial of license may include reliable
information indicating that the applicant has in the past engaged in
fraudulent or deceptive business practices in a business identical to or
similar to a dealer in secondhand goods. A license may be denied if the
investigation reveals a conviction of the applicant or any of its principal
officers or employees of any crime(s), disorderly persons offense(s) in
which deceit or misrepresentation is an element; or any conviction of
any crime(s), disorderly persons offense involving theft or the receiving
of stolen goods, regardless of whether the applicant was a principal,
accessory before the fact, after the fact, or a co-conspirator; or any
prior municipal ordinance violation(s) by the applicant or any of its
principal officers or employees in this or any other jurisdiction. A
license may be denied if the applicant fails to demonstrate an ability to
satisfactorily comply with the reporting requirements specified in
§ 135-61.1, the retention and inspection requirements of § 135-61, or
any other portion of this chapter. Upon receipt of the recommendation
of the Chief of Police, the Municipal Clerk shall issue or deny the license
accordingly, contingent upon the receipt of a bond as required by
§ 135-61.2 of this chapter.
E. Whenever any application for a permit is denied, the applicant shall be
entitled to a hearing before a three-person panel appointed by the Chief
of Police, at which time the applicant shall be permitted to introduce

dealer of secondhand goods.

audible at distance of 25 feet in any direction from the operator
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.
D. Personal or commercial vehicular music amplification or reproduction
equipment shall not be operated in such a manner that is plainly
audible at a distance of 50 feet in any direction from the operator
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
A. Violation of any provision of this ordinance shall be cause for a Notice of
Violation (NOV) or a Notice of Penalty Assessment (NOPA) document to
be issued to the violator by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator.
B. Any person who violates any provision of this ordinance shall be subject
to a civil penalty for each offense of not more than $3,000. If the
violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which it occurs shall
constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.
C. Upon identification of a violation of this Ordinance the Noise Control
Officer or Noise Control Investigator shall issue an enforcement
document to the violator. The enforcement document shall identify the
condition or activity that constitutes the violation and the specific
provision of this Ordinance that has been violated. It shall also indicate
whether the violator has a period of time to correct the violation before
a penalty is sought.
D. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a minor violation (as defined in § 147-2 of this
ordinance) a NOV shall be issued to the violator.
(1) The document shall indicate that the purpose of the NOV is
intended to serve as a notice to warn the responsible party/violator
of the violation conditions in order to provide them with an
opportunity to voluntarily investigate the matter and voluntarily
take corrective action to address the identified violation.
(2) The NOV shall identify the time period (up to 90 days) pursuant to
the Grace Period Law, N.J.S.A. 13:1D-125 et seq. where the
responsible party's/violators' voluntary action can prevent a formal
enforcement action with penalties issued. It shall be noted that the
NOV does not constitute a formal enforcement action, a final
agency action or a final legal determination that a violation has
occurred. Therefore, the NOV may not be appealed or contested.
E. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a non-minor violation the violator shall be notified
that if the violation is not immediately corrected a NOPA with a civil
penalty of no more than $3,000 will be issued. If a non-minor violation is
§ 147-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 147-11
1:489
Chapter 150
NUISANCES, PUBLIC HEALTH
immediately corrected a Notice of Violation without a civil penalty
shall still be issued to document the violation. If the violation occurs
again (within 12 months of the initial violation) a NOPA shall be issued
regardless of whether the violation is immediately corrected or not.
F. The violator may request from the Noise Control Officer or Noise
Control Investigator, an extension of the compliance deadline in the
enforcement action. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator shall have the option to approve any reasonable request for
an extension (not to exceed 180 days) if the violator can demonstrate
that a good faith effort has been made to achieve compliance. If an
extension is not granted and the violation continues to exist after the
grace period time ends, a NOPA shall be issued.
G. The recipient of a NOPA shall be entitled to a hearing in a municipal
court having jurisdiction to contest such action.
H. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control Investigator may seek
injunctive relief if the responsible party does not remediate the
violation within the period of time specified in the NOPA issued.
I. Any claim for a civil penalty may be compromised and settled based
upon the following factors:
(1) Mitigating or any other extenuating circumstances;
(2) The timely implementation by the violator of measures which lead
to compliance;
(3) The conduct of the violator; and
(4) The compliance history of the violator.

Chapter 153
OBSCENITY AND PUBLIC INDECENCY
§ 153-1. Purpose.
The Township of East Brunswick is attempting to prevent the deterioration
of the various commercial districts within the municipality and is further
attempting to preserve real estate values, reduce the incidence of crime
and encourage residents and businesses to remain in their present
neighborhoods and to maintain their properties. The Township of East
Brunswick intends to regulate adult uses within the municipality in order
to prohibit the display of adult reading material within the open view
and reach of children under the age of eighteen (18) years. The East
Brunswick Township Council finds that such material is adverse to the
public peace, morals and good order of the Township. The Township Council
further finds that it is in the best interest of the public health, safety and
welfare of the Township to restrict the display of adult reading material
and to adopt regulations toward that end. In addition, the Township of
East Brunswick wishes to discourage the attraction of transients into the
commercial areas of the Township of East Brunswick. The Township of East
Brunswick further finds that the location of adult entertainment activities
near shopping centers and public areas which are open to family groups
and children have an adverse effect on such persons and may contribute to
increased crime and juvenile delinquency. The Township further finds that
they tend to attract an undesirable quantity and quality of clientele. For all
of the foregoing reasons the Township of East Brunswick hereby regulates
obscene conduct and the distribution and promotion of obscene material.

become effective less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days
after notice thereof by certified mail is given to the tenant.
C. For leases of less than one (1) year, the landlord shall calculate the
percentage of rental increase by obtaining the ratio of the number of
months since the last rental increase divided by twelve (12) months.
This fraction shall then be multiplied by the Consumer Price Index
percentage increase for the previous twelve (12) month period in order
to determine the percentage of increased rental to which the landlord is
entitled.
A. The landlord may seek a Property Tax Surcharge from a tenant based
upon an increase in property taxes in the year in which the surcharge is
sought over the immediately preceding year. The Property Tax
Surcharge shall not exceed that amount authorized by the following
provisions:
(1) The landlord shall determine the increase in the present property
tax over the property tax of the previous year and divide that
increase by the total number of square feet in the dwelling or
dwellings to determine the tax increase per square feet therein.
(2) The tenant may thereafter be surcharged for his proportionate
share of the tax increase by multiplying the tax increase per square
foot by the number of square feet occupied by the tenant.
B. Specifically, the words "previous year" are intended to refer to the year
previous to that in which the landlord is seeking a Property Tax
Surcharge increase and to no other year. If a landlord has not
attempted to obtain a Property Tax Surcharge for property tax
increases from an immediately preceding year, the landlord shall be
deemed to have waived the right to seek such increase in any
subsequent year.
§ 169-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 169-9
1:555
§ 169-10. Notice of Property Tax Surcharge.
A landlord seeking a Property Tax Surcharge shall notify the tenant by
certified mail of the calculations involved in computing the surcharge,
including the present property tax for the dwelling or dwellings, the
property tax for the dwelling for the previous year, the number of square
feet in the dwelling, the tax increase per square foot, the number of square
feet occupied by the tenant and the maximum allowable surcharge. No
surcharge as set forth above shall become effective less than thirty (30)
days after notice thereof by certified mail is given to the tenant. The
landlord may send notice of a property tax surcharge to the tenant at any
time after the new tax bill is received by the landlord.
§ 169-11. Payment of Property Tax Surcharge.
The tenant shall be permitted to pay the property tax surcharge as
determined under this chapter in twelve (12) consecutive equal monthly
installments.

§ 169-13. Refund to Tenant in Case of Successful Tax Appeal by

In the event that a tax appeal is taken by a landlord and the landlord
is successful in said appeal and the taxes are reduced, the tenant shall
C. Property Tax Surcharge: Cumulative Intent. Landlords shall be allowed
to accumulate Property Tax Surcharges which have been passed
through to their tenants as allowed by this ordinance. A landlord must
notify his tenants of any increase in the Property Tax Surcharge
attributable to property tax increases incurred in the preceding 12
months, and the total cumulative Property Tax Surcharge in any given
lease.
D. Calculating Property Tax Surcharge in the Event of a Decrease in
Property Taxes Due to a Reduction in the Property's Assessed Value or a
Reduced Tax Rate. In the event there is a decrease in property taxes
due to a reduction in the property's assessed value or a reduced tax
rate, the existing Property Tax Surcharge will be decreased. Decreases
will be calculated and passed through in the same manner as increases
in § 169-9A. Reductions in Property Tax Surcharges will be applied
against previously imposed Property Tax Surcharges, in an amount not
exceeding such surcharges. If there were no such surcharges, then
there will be no reduction. The landlord may subtract administrative
costs, calculated at l l/2 times the cost of certified mail, return receipt
requested, from the reduction.
§ 169-9 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 169-13
1:556
receive one hundred percent (100%) of said reduction after deducting all
expenses incurred by the landlord in processing said appeal. Tax refunds
will be applied against previously imposed tax surcharges in an amount not
exceeding such surcharge, but if there was no such tax surcharge, then
the tax refund will not be payable to a tenant. The tenant refund shall
be calculated in the same manner that the Property Tax Surcharge was
calculated. In the same manner, existing property tax surcharges will be
lowered to reflect the reduced property tax.
§ 169-14. Conversion of Rental Units to Cooperatives or
Condominiums.
All tenants in occupancy at the time of conversion of rental units to
cooperatives or condominiums and all landlords of such rental units shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Ordinance. No increase in taxes
caused by such conversion above the average increase in taxes throughout
the Township shall be passed on to tenants in occupancy at the time of such
conversion.
§ 169-15. Consumer Price Index Energy Adjustment Not Considered
Rent for Subsequent Increases.
Existing Consumer Price Index Energy Adjustments which have been
previously passed on to the tenant are to be kept separate from the base
rent when computing the cost of living rental increases. Should fuel costs
fall below the level in effect as of the date of this ordinance, renewing
tenants will have their Consumer Price Index Energy Adjustment surcharge
reduced accordingly. Should Consumer Price Index Energy Adjustment
surcharges be reduced to zero, they will be eliminated permanently.
§ 169-16. Capital Improvement Surcharge.
A. A landlord contemplating an optional capital improvement, as defined
in Section 169-1, Definitions, must file an application to the Board for a
surcharge prior to construction or installation if he seeks to impose a
Capital Improvement Surcharge upon the tenants. The application must
set forth the projected costs, the method of calculation, the method of
financing, the cost of financing, the useful life and a justification for
seeking the Capital Improvement Surcharge. If the Rent Leveling Board
is not satisfied with the justification, it may request additional
information or may reject the application based upon evidence
presented.
B. The landlord shall be required to send official notices to each tenant
affected by the application at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing
scheduled before the Board. In addition, the Rent Leveling Office will

forth in paragraph A above unless the landlord can justify to the Board
why it was impossible to furnish notice and seek Board approval prior
to the installation or construction of the improvement.
D. The length of the surcharge shall be based on "the useful life" of the
improvement as defined by the manufacturer. The Housing Office will
verify the reasonableness of the "useful life" by surveying at least three
other manufacturers (if possible) as to their estimate of "useful life".
Payment shall be made by the tenant in equal monthly installments.
E. Where per apartment costs are known, they should be used as a basis
for apportioning the surcharge. When per apartment costs are
unknown, a pro-ration based upon square footage should be used.
F. The Capital Improvement Surcharge shall become effective no sooner
than the renewal date of the next lease and no time during a pending or
current lease.
G. The Capital Improvement Surcharge shall be kept separate from the
base rent when computing cost of living rental increase.
H. Only the initial investment and financing costs are eligible for the
Capital Improvement Surcharge. Repairs and replacements are to be
absorbed by the landlord as operating expenses and are not eligible for
the Capital Improvement Surcharge.
I. Formal notification shall be given by the landlord to the tenants of any
determination made by the Board upon an application for a Capital
Improvement Surcharge within ten (10) days of any determination. In
addition, the Rent Leveling Board will publish official notice of the
determination in the official Township newspaper within ten (10) days
of any determination.
A. In determining any hardship application, the Rent Leveling Board shall
consider financial factors which are to be submitted by the landlord.
The landlord shall submit a Profit and Loss Statement reflecting
information for three (3) years prior to the year of the application. A
landlord seeking an increase in rent shall provide a minimum of
financial factors as indicated on a standardized form provided by the
East Brunswick Department of Planning and Engineering, as well as
any other information pertinent as required under this Ordinance.

landlords of less than 100 units. Any money not required for consulting
fees shall be refunded to the landlord.

allows, with just cause, for the maintenance of a Dollar Net Operating
Income (NOI) with a cost of living increase on that portion of the NOI
which is the profit.
Only valid cause for loss of return of Net Operating Income shall be
permitted as the basis for a hardship application hereunder.
D. Hardships resulting from mandatory refinancing or resale will be
addressed by the Board as Special Circumstances as defined in Section
169-18.

determination made by the Board upon an application for a hardship
increase in rental within ten (10) days from the date of the
determination. In addition, the Rent Leveling office shall publish official

refinancing terms which are commercially reasonable under the
circumstances.

balance on a first mortgage or secondary financing which is part of the
original purchase, provided the same is the result of an arms length

temporary in nature and in authorizing that relief, the Rent Leveling Board
shall determine the period of time for which the temporary relief shall be

of the apartment complex for rental purposes.

rent until the landlord corrects the deficiency.
§ 169-25. Tax Rebate; N.J.R.S. 54:4-5.2.
The property tax reduction for residential rental property provided for in
N.J.R.S. 54:4-5.2 et seq. shall be divided by the total rentable square feet
contained within all mobile homes spaces or residential rental units on
such property to determine the annual property tax rebate or credit per
square foot for every residential unit in the entire property. The square
footage of each unit shall be multiplied by such property tax rebate or
credit for each residential unit. However, where one (1) or more residential
rental units, spaces or equivalent are occupied by the property owner or his

§ 169-33. Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge. [Added
4-15-88 by Ord. No. 88-919]
State-mandated increases in tipping fees and/or solid waste removal carting
fees may be passed through by garden apartment landlords to tenants,
subject to action by the East Brunswick Township Council which would
provide reimbursement to landlords for such increases. Total increases
incurred by landlords in said costs will be passed through to the tenants as
a Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge on the following basis: 40%
of the increase payable to the tenant, and 60% of the increase payable to
the landlord.
A. The landlord may seek a Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge
from a tenant based upon state-mandated increases in garbage and the
surcharge is sought over the immediately preceding year. The Garbage
and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge shall not exceed that amount
authorized by the following provisions.
(1) The landlord shall determine the increase in the present garbage
and solid waste removal carting and tipping fees over the same fees
charged in the previous year, and divide that increase by the total
number of square feet in the dwelling or dwellings to determine the
Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge per square foot
therein.
§ 169-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 169-33
1:563
§ 169-34. Notice of Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge.
[Added 4-25-88 by Ord. No. 88-919]
A landlord seeking a Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge shall
notify the tenant of the calculations involved in computing the surcharge,
including the present garbage and solid waste costs for the dwelling or
dwellings, the garbage and solid waste removal costs for the dwelling for
the previous year, the number of square feet in the dwelling, the garbage
and solid waste removal fee increase per square foot, the number of square
feet occupied by the tenant and the maximum allowable surcharge. No
surcharge as set forth shall become effective less than thirty (30) days after
the notice thereof by certified mail is given to the tenant, and said increase
shall only be applied at time of lease renewal.
§ 169-35. Payment of Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge.
[Added 4-25-88 by Ord. No. 88-919]
The tenant shall be permitted to pay the Garbage and Solid Waste Removal
Surcharge as determined under this Chapter in twelve (12) consecutive
equal monthly installments. The tenant shall continue to pay the same
monthly surcharge until such time as the costs to the landlord are
decreased and notice of same has been given by certified mail to the tenant.
§ 169-36. Decreases in Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Fees.
[Added 4-25-88 by Ord. No. 88-919]
In the event there is a decrease in garbage and solid waste removal fees,
the existing Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge will be decreased.
Decreases will be calculated and passed through in the same manner as
increases in Section 37. Section 169-32. Garbage and solid waste removal
surcharges will be applied against previously imposed garbage and solid
waste surcharges in an amount not exceeding such surcharges. If there
were no such surcharges, then there will be no reduction. The landlord may
subtract from the reduction administrative costs calculated at 1-1/2 times
the cost of certified mail, return receipt requested.
(2) The tenant may thereafter be surcharged for his/her proportionate
share of the garbage and solid waste removal carting and tipping
fee increase by multiplying the increase per square foot by the
number of square feet occupied by the tenant.
B. Specifically, the words "previous year" are intended to refer to the year
previous to that in which the landlord is seeking a Garbage and Solid
Waste Removal Surcharge and to no other year. If a landlord has not
attempted to obtain a Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge for
increases from an immediately preceding year, the landlord shall be
deemed to have waived the right to seek such increases in any
subsequent year.

§ 169-37. Garbage and Solid Waste Removal Surcharge Not
Considered Rent for Subsequent Increases. [Added 4-25-88 by Ord.
No. 88-919]

rent for purposes of computing costs of living rental increases.

§ 174-10. Creation of septic system management area. [Added
8-27-79 by Ord. No. 79-157]
Septic tanks and other subsurface waste disposal systems are used
extensively throughout portions of the Township of East Brunswick. They
are an adequate and beneficial system of domestic waste disposal if
properly installed, operated and maintained and are an economically
feasible alternative to costly sanitary sewer systems. However, they
presently constitute a problem in the township because a large percentage
of the systems are not properly installed, operated and maintained or have
failed, causing potential pollution of ground and surface waters, potential
contamination of potable water supplies, foul odors, nuisance problems
and hazards to public health. Therefore, an East Brunswick septic system
management area is created, including those areas of the township where
septic systems are used extensively as specifically delineated on a Septic
System Management Area Map dated July 9, 1979, prepared by Carl E.
Hintz, P.P., and which is on file in the office of the East Brunswick Township
Clerk.

SEWER CONNECTIONS
§ 174-8 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 177-1
1:572
§ 177-1. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SEWAGE  Any and all liquid waste containing animal or vegetable matter
in suspension or solution, and the water carrying waste from the discharge
of toilets, laundry tubs, washing machines, sinks and dishwashers, or any
other source of water carrying bodily waste of human beings or waste
containing putrescible material.
§ 177-2. Required connections.
The owner of any house, building or structure located on a street along the
line of any sewer which is now in operation or is constructed in the future
in the Township of East Brunswick shall connect the drainage of all sources
of sewage in his house, building or structure to the sewer. Each house shall
have a separate connection to the sewer system.
§ 177-3. Exceptions. [Amended 3-11-91 by Ord. No. 91-27; 9-27-10
by Ord. No. 10-22]
Any single-family dwelling which, because of its location cannot drain into
a sewer line by gravity, may be granted an exception to use a pre-existing
individual sewerage disposal system which complies with all applicable
provisions of this Code as follows: Application shall be made to the East
Brunswick liaison to the Middlesex County Health Department, who shall
transmit the application to the Middlesex County Health Department and
the East Brunswick Sewer Utility. If both the Middlesex County Health
Department and the East Brunswick Sewer Utility approve the exemption,
the East Brunswick liaison shall issue a written exemption. A single-family
dwelling may be exempt from the requirement to connect with a public
sewer if requiring the connection would impose an unnecessary hardship
on the owner of the premises. No exemption will be granted if it would
result in the continuation of, or creation of, an unhealthy or unsanitary
condition. A single-family dwelling containing a washing machine or laundry
tub located in the basement prior to construction of the public sewer line
does not qualify for this exception, and the washing machine and tub
must be connected to the sewer line, even if pumping is required for the
tub and/or washing machine. If there is a change in the sanitary sewer
system that would eliminate the need for a pump or otherwise remove the
basis for the claimed hardship, the East Brunswick liaison, after receiving
written approval from the Middlesex County Health Department and the
East Brunswick Sewer Utility, shall send written notice to the homeowner
advising that the exemption has been rescinded. The homeowner will
thereupon be required to connect to the sewer system in accordance with
Section 177-2 of the Code.
§ 177-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 177-4
1:573
§ 177-4. Time limit for making connections.
Connections shall be made within thirty (30) days after the service of notice
as provided in § 177-5.
§ 177-5. Notice to connect required.
The Director of Health and Welfare shall give at least thirty (30) days' notice
to the owner of property affected before proceeding to award a contract for
the making of the connection or causing it to be made by the municipality
as provided in § 177-10.
§ 177-6. Contents of notice to connect.
A notice given under this chapter shall contain a description of the property
affected, sufficient to identify it, and a statement that if the connection is not
made within thirty (30) days after service of the notice, the township shall
make it or cause it to be made at the owner's expense under the authority
of N.J.R.S. 40:63-54. No special form of notice shall be required.
§ 177-7. Service of notice to connect.
§ 177-8. Filing of proof of service.
Proof of service shall be filed with the Tax Collector of the township within
ten (10) days after service is made.
§ 177-9. Defective notice shall not invalidate charges.
Failure to file proof of service, misstatement of the name of the property
owner or similar errors or omissions in the giving of notice shall not
A. Notices under this chapter shall be served as follows:
(1) Upon owners resident in the township, personally or by leaving the
notice at their usual place of residence with some member of their
family above the age of fourteen (14) years.
(2) Upon owners not resident in the township, personally or by mailing
the notice to the owner's last known post office address or by
service upon an occupant of the property or an agent of the owner
in charge of the property.
(3) Where service cannot be made under Subsection A(1) or A(2), the
notice may be served by publishing it once in a newspaper
circulating in the township. One (1) published notice may relate to
several different properties.
B. Owners who are infants or of unsound mind or the beneficiaries of

ARTICLE I
General Design Guidelines and Standards
§ 192-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidelines and standards for site
plan, P.U.R.D. and subdivision design and associated improvements, and
to guide the approving authority in the promotion of the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare. In accordance with N.J.S.A. 40-55D-2
municipalities are permitted to adopt regulations which will promote a
desirable visual environment through creative development techniques and
good civic design and arrangements.
§ 192-2. Requirements. [Amended 8-25-97 by Ord. No. 97-25]
Effective June 3, 1997 certain site improvements as specified by state
statute and associated with residential site plans, subdivisions or P.U.R.D.'s
shall be regulated by the Residential Site Improvement Standards (N.J.A.C.,
Title 5, Chapter 21). Any required improvements not provided for within
this chapter shall be designed in accordance with professionally recognized
design standards and constructed in accordance with accepted engineering
and planning practice. Prior agreement between the approving authority
and the applicant shall be provided for standards not covered in this
ordinance.
Except for those site improvements associated with residential development
and governed by the provisions of the Residential Site Improvement
Standards (N.J.A.C. Title 5, Chapter 21) should it be demonstrated that the
minimum requirements herein, in a particular situation are not adequate to
protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the township
the approving Board may apply more stringent requirements based on the
advice of its professionals and accepted engineering and planning practice.
§ 192-3. Responsibility for Design.
The developer shall be responsible for and bear the entire cost of any and all
investigations, tests, reports, surveys, samples, calculations, environmental
assessments, designs, researches or any other activity necessary for the
completion of the design. In those cases not covered by these standards,
sufficient precautions shall be taken to assure that the design implements
the purposes of this chapter, the Zoning Ordinance and the Township
Master Plan. Any decision of the Planning or Zoning Board regarding the
suitability or sufficiency of any design proposal, taken upon advice of its
professionals and subject to the provisions of this ordinance, shall be
deemed conclusive and shall govern.
§ 192-4. Waiver of Requirement. [Amended 8-25-97 by Ord. No.
97-25]
The rules, regulations and standards set forth in this chapter shall be
considered the minimum requirements for the protection of the public
§ 192-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-4
1:601
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the township. However, if
the applicant can clearly demonstrate that, because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to his land, the literal enforcement of this chapter is
impracticable or will exact undue hardship, the Planning or Zoning Board
may permit such exemption(s) and waiver(s) as may be reasonable, within
the general purpose and intent of the rules, regulations and standards
established by this chapter, the Township Zoning Ordinance and Township
Master Plan. Waivers of Residential Site Improvement Standards shall
follow the procedures outlined in N.J.A.C., Title 5, Chapter 21.
§ 192-5. Definition. [Amended 5-9-11 by Ord. No. 11-06]

ARTICLE II
Design Objectives
In project design and in reviewing all development applications, the
following principles of subdivision and site design shall apply:
§ 192-6. Site Analysis.
Assessment of site characteristics, such as general site condition; geology
and soil; topography; climate; ecology; existing vegetation, structures and
road networks; environmental features; visual features; adjacent sites and
uses; environmental hazards, such as noise, pollution, etc. and past and
present use of the site.
§ 192-7. Building and Parking Layout.
The design layout of buildings and parking areas shall be reviewed so as to
provide an aesthetically pleasing design as well as an efficient arrangement.
Particular attention shall be given to public safety and emergency vehicle
accessibility, impact on surrounding development and contiguous and
adjacent buildings and lands. Streets, lots, parking areas, and buildings
shall be designed and arranged to reduce unnecessary impervious cover
and to mitigate adverse effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic, glare,
drainage and utilities on neighboring properties. Buildings shall be spaced
so that adequate privacy and security is provided. Pedestrian and vehicular
traffic movements within and adjacent to the site shall be planned with
particular emphasis on the provision of, and efficient layout of, parking
areas, off-street loading and unloading, safe movement of people, goods
and vehicles from access roads within the site, between buildings and
between buildings and vehicles. On each application for site plan approval
the Planning Board shall determine where parking islands are required
in parking lots. In arriving at its determination, the Planning Board shall
consider internal traffic circulation, protection for lighting stanchions, sign
and other structures, size of the proposed paved portion of the parking lot,
intensity of use of facility, desirability of landscaping islands and overall
safety of the area.
§ 192-8. Access to Streets.
Access to the site from adjacent streets shall be designed so as to interfere
as little as possible with traffic flow on these streets and to permit vehicles
rapid and safe ingress to and egress from the site.
§ 192-9. Environmental Features, Grading.
Locate development to preserve the natural features of the site, to preserve
areas of environmental sensitivity and to minimize negative impacts and
alteration of natural features. Design buildings, lots and sites to reduce cut
and fill, to avoid flooding and adversely affecting ground water quality and
§ 192-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-9
1:603
aquifer recharge. Conservation easements may be required along drainage
and stormwater courses and around ponds, marshes, bogs, streams and
other watercourses and along steep slopes or around significant stands of
trees. Such easements are intended to preserve the stabilizing vegetation
to prevent erosion.
§ 192-10. Street System.
Design street system to permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of
traffic. Design the street system to have a logical pattern; to respect natural
features and topography; and to present an attractive streetscape.
§ 192-11. Parking.
A sufficient number of on-site parking spaces shall be provided to avoid
parking congestion on adjacent sites and streets. Parking stalls shall be
sized to provide sufficient space for access to vehicles without damage to
property.
§ 192-12. Lighting.
Adequate lighting shall be provided to ensure safe movement of persons and
vehicles and for security purposes. Directional lights shall be arranged so
as to minimize glare and reflections on adjacent properties.
§ 192-13. Buffering.
Buffering shall be located around the perimeter of the site to minimize
off-site glare from headlights of vehicles, noise, light from structures, to
screen the movement of people and vehicles, and to shield activities from
adjacent properties when necessary. Buffering serves as a protective barrier
and serves to reduce air pollution, dust and litter. Buffering shall provide
a year-round visual screen in order to minimize adverse impacts between
adjacent properties. Buffering may consist of fencing, berms, evergreens,
shrubs, bushes, deciduous trees or combinations thereof to achieve the
stated objectives.
§ 192-14. Landscaping.
Whereas it has been noted that well designed landscape plantings and

Large trees (40+) 50
Medium-sized trees (30-40) 40
Small trees (to 30) 30
When the spacing interval exceeds 40 feet, small ornamental trees can
be spaced between the larger trees. If a street canopy effect is desired,
trees may be planted closer together, following the recommendations
of the Township Landscape Architect. The trees shall be planted so as
not to interfere with utilities, roadways, sidewalks, sight easements, or
street lights.
D. Planting Specifications.
All trees shall be placed in a proper manner and in a good grade of
backfill, according to accepted horticultural standards.
All shade trees shall be watered weekly through the first growing
season. The developer shall construct a six (6) inch deep earth saucer
around each tree to hold water and fill with a suitable mulch. Trees
shall be nursery grown, insect and disease free, balled and
biodegradable burlap, pruned and shaped, of the required height and
planted according to acceptable horticultural standards. Shade trees
shall be of substantially uniform size and shape and shall have straight
trunks. Ornamental trees need not have straight trunks only at the
direction of the Township Landscape Architect. All trees shall be
planted according to nursery standards.
A hole in which a tree is to be planted shall be in each case, a minimum
of one-third (1/3) larger in width and in depth than the existing root
ball of the particular tree to be planted. The hole for a tree to be
planted shall contain proper amounts of topsoil and peat moss. When
determined by the Department of Planning and Engineering that a soil
test indicates special needs the planting requirements will be modified
as a condition of board approval.
E. Planting Procedure.
The following tree planting procedure shall be followed:
1. Excavations shall not be less than thirty (30) inches deep and thirty
(30) inches in diameter. A suitable area shall be provided by
loosening the soil to a depth of 12" below the excavation. Planting
soil shall be typically composed of a thorough mixture of one part
peat, one part humus, one part of parent soil, all mixed thoroughly
(unless soil tests indicate special requirements to be determined by
Planning and Engineering staff).

2. Each tree shall be given a minimum of twenty (20) gallons of water
at the time of planting.
3. Trees shall be staked with three (3) stakes driven a minimum of two
(2) feet into undisturbed soil outside the planting hole. Stakes when
driven shall be one-half to two-thirds (1/2 to 2/3) the height of the
tree measured from ground level. Stakes shall be two (2) inches in
diameter, minimum, at the narrowest end. Stakes shall be placed in
line with prevailing winds. Stakes shall be attached to the tree with
twelve-gauge galvanized wire covered with rubber or plastic hose
where wire is likely to come in contact with the tree trunk. An
alternate may be any of the commercially available materials
designed for staking trees upon approval of the Township. The loop
in contact with the tree shall be loose enough to permit growth and
prevent grinding and girdling for two (2) years but shall be tightly
bound to the stake to prevent slipping. [Amended 5-10-93 by
Ord. No. 93-22]
4. Upon completion, removal of all planting debris is required. The
area must be left in a neat and orderly condition in accordance with
good and acceptable planting practices.
5. Notice shall be given to the Township Landscape Architect or
designee three days prior to the start of planting so the stock may
be inspected for variety, condition, size and quality.
A. Required.
Sidewalks and curbs shall be constructed and installed on both sides
of each street in accordance with specifications promulgated by the

All applications shall comply with the standards for Soil Erosion & Sediment
Control in New Jersey by the New Jersey State Soil Conservation
Committee. All plans shall incorporate soil erosion and sediment control
programs phased according to the scheduled progress of the development,
including anticipated starting and completion dates. The purpose is to
control soil erosion and sediment damages and related environmental
damage by requiring adequate provisions for surface water retention and
drainage and for the protection of exposed soil surfaces in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community.
If no board approval or Freehold Soil Conservation Service approval is
A. Required.
Sight easements shall be provided at each quadrant of an intersection
of streets or streets and driveways and shall be shown on the plan. Any
development requiring site plan or subdivision approval shall provide
adequate sight easements at each driveway with the driveway classified
as a local street for purposes of establishing distances.
B. Dedicated; easement.
The area within sight easement shall be kept as part of the lot and
identified as a sight easement. The wording of the sight easement shall
be subject to the review and approval of the Board Attorney.
C. Clearance.
No grading, planting or structure shall be erected or maintained higher
than thirty (30) inches above the center-line grade of the intersecting
street or driveway or lower than ten (10) feet above their center lines,
excluding street name signs and official traffic regulation signs. Where
any intersection involves earth banks or vegetation, including trees,
the developer shall trim or selectively thin trees and grade to provide
adequate sight distance. Within these sight easements, plantings
should be restricted to low spreading varieties of plants and shrubs.
D. Area.
The sight easement is that area bounded by the intersecting street
center lines and a straight line which connects sight points located on
each of the two (2) intersecting street center lines. The sight easement
distances shall be in accordance with A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets 1984 by American Association of State Highway
and Transportation Officials.
E. Lot Area.
Portions of a lot set aside for the sight easement may be calculated
in determining the lot area and may be included in establishing the
minimum setbacks required by the zoning provisions.
§ 192-50 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 192-51
1:640
required the applicant shall submit a plan conforming to all aspects of this
section.
A. General Design Principles.
1. Control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed land
disturbances and shall be in operation during all stages of the
disturbance activity. The following principles shall apply to the soil
erosion and sediment control plan:
a. Stripping of vegetation, grading or other soil disturbance shall
be done in a manner which will minimize soil erosion.
b. Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained and
protected.
c. The extent of the disturbed area and the duration of its
exposure shall be kept within practical limits.
d. Either temporary seeding, mulching or other suitable
stabilization measures shall be used to protect exposed critical
areas during construction or other land disturbances.
e. Drainage provisions shall accommodate increased runoff
resulting from modified soil and surface conditions during and
after development or land disturbance.
f. Water runoff shall be minimized and retained on site wherever
possible to facilitate groundwater recharge.
g. Sediment shall be retained on site.
h. Diversions, sediment basins and similar required structures
shall be installed prior to any on-site grading or land
disturbance.
2. All lots where fill material is deposited shall have clean fill and/or
topsoil deposited which shall be graded to allow complete surface
draining of the lot into local storm sewer systems or natural
drainage courses. No regrading of a lot shall be permitted which
would create or aggravate water stagnation or a drainage problem
on site or on adjacent properties. Grading shall be limited to areas
shown on an approved site plan or subdivision. Any topsoil
disturbed during approved excavation and grading operations shall
be redistributed throughout the site.
3. Excavation of soil other than as required for the construction of
approved structures and supporting facilities, such as but not
limited to streets, driveways and parking areas, shall be prohibited.
Regrading of property so as to redistribute topsoil throughout the
site from areas excavated shall be done to minimize or eliminate
the erosion of soil.

along the fence or wall enclosing the refuse storage area. The
landscaping to be provided shall be shown on the site plan
submitted for approval. The planting shall be placed so at maturity
the plants do not encroach upon the refuse container, nor result in
an opening less than ten (10) feet for vehicle access.
4. The opening in the enclosed refuse area should be located to
minimize the view of refuse from adjoining properties or public
streets.
5. If located within or adjacent to a parking area or access drive, the
enclosed refuse area shall be separated from such parking areas or
access drive by curbing.
6. The enclosed refuse area shall not be located so as to interfere with
traffic circulation or the parking of vehicles.
7. All refuse and recyclables shall be deposited in containers
maintained within the refuse area. No containers shall be
maintained anywhere on a site except in a refuse area meeting
these requirements.
8. If outdoor storage of solid waste and recyclables is not proposed,
the site plan submission shall detail the methods proposed for
accommodating solid waste within the structure. The Approving
§ 192-51 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 192-52
1:642
Authority may require that a suitable area be set aside, but not
improved, for a future solid waste storage area meeting these
requirements even if indoor accommodations for solid waste are
proposed.
B. Multifamily Housing Developments. [Added 12-13-93 by Ord. No.
93-74]
1. In any new multifamily housing development an indoor or outdoor
recycling area for the collection and storage of residentiallygenerated
recyclable materials shall be provided. The dimensions
of the recycling area shall be sufficient to accommodate recycling
bins or containers which are of adequate size and number, and
which are consistent with anticipated usage and with current
methods of collection in the area in which the project is located.

§ 192-53. Storm Drainage Facilities. [Amended 8-25-97 by Ord. No.
97-25; 2-27-06 by Ord. No. 06-05; 7-20-09 by Ord. No. 09-16]
For residential development these standards are superseded by Residential
Site Improvement Standards (N.J.A.C., Title 5, Chapter 21).
A. Scope and Purpose.
1. Policy Statement.
Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant reduction
through nonstructural or low impact techniques shall be explored
before relying on structural strategies. Structural strategies should
be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management
strategies and proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies
include both environmentally sensitive site design and source
controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or
from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans should
be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin,
nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential
pollutants. Multiple stormwater management strategies may be
necessary to achieve the established performance standards for
water quality, quantity, and groundwater recharge.
2. Purpose.
The purpose of this ordinance is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls for "major development,"
which is defined in Chapter 132-3 as "Any development or
redevelopment that provides for disturbance of one quarter (1/
4) acre of land. Disturbance for the purpose of this rule is the
placement of impervious surface or exposure and/or movement of
soil or bedrock or clearing, cutting, or removing of vegetation".
3. Applicability.
a. This ordinance shall be applicable to all site plans and
subdivisions for the following major developments that require
preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review:
(1) Non-residential major developments; and
(2) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards
at N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(3) All major developments undertaken by East Brunswick
Township
4. Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans
pursuant to this ordinance are to be considered an integral part of
§ 192-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 192-53
1:644
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review
process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by
any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. In their
interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion
of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This ordinance
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law
except that, where any provision of this ordinance imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance,
rule or regulation, or other provision of law, the more restrictive
provisions or higher standards shall control.
B. General Standards.
1. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards herein. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.
2. The standards in this ordinance apply only to new major
development and are intended to minimize the impact of
stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity in receiving
water bodies and maintain groundwater recharge.
3. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered
species as documented in the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protections's (NJDEP) Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147
through 15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or
Clemmys muhlnebergi (bog turtle).

sidewalk or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided
that the access is made of permeable material.
5. The applicant may be required by the approving authority to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may
exist either previously to, or as a result of the application. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where
feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate
width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the Township
construction standards and specifications.
6. All storm drainage shall be piped underground, except that where
it is not feasible to pipe, open ditches may be constructed.
(a) Where storm drainage is piped, an easement of not less than
twenty-five (25) feet shall be shown on the approved plan and
conveyed to the township.
(b) Where the storm drainage flows in an open ditch, an easement
of not less than fifty (50) feet shall be shown on the approved
plan and shall be conveyed to the township. The ditch shall be
constructed so as to prevent erosion, be easily maintainable
and shall be provided with safety features as it may deem
necessary to protect and safeguard the public.
7. The applicant's Engineer shall also determine and identify to the
Approving Authority the effect of each application on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the application.
Studies may be required of the applicant and, as shall be
appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements.
8. Where in the opinion of the Township Engineer, underdrainage is
required, the subdivider shall install subbase underdrains or Type
F underdrains in accordance with the New Jersey State Highway
Specifications of 1989 as amended and supplemented; and shall be
of the size specified by the Township Engineer.
If in the opinion of the Township Engineer, and existing conditions
exist, the applicant may be required to construct a (supac or
equivalent filter fabric) lined ditch backfilled with 3/8" washed
stone, with a minimum slope of 2% and concrete porous wall pipe
set in the stone and connected to a downgrade inlet. Construction
of such underdrains shall be in accordance with the standard
details on file in the Department of Planning and Engineering.
All underdrain systems constructed within a site or subdivision
shall be provided with a clean-out in accordance with the standards
details on file in the Department of Planning and Engineering.

into an inlet or other appropriate facility or area. Subbase outlet
drains shall be 6" c.m. pipe fully coated with half of pipe and end
cap perforated or extra strength porous wall pipe with appropriate
cap.
Subbase outlet drains will be required at low points in roadways
and at other locations where necessary.
10. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of this Section may be obtained for the enlargement
of an existing public roadway or railroad; or the construction or
enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided that each of
the following conditions are met:
a. The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
b. The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis,
that through the use of nonstructural and structural
stormwater management strategies and measures, the option
selected complies with this Chapter's Erosion Control,
Groundwater Recharge, Stormwater Runoff Quantity and
Quality Design and Performance Standards (hereafter the
Design and Performance Standards) to the maximum extent
practicable;
c. The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the
requirements of the Design and Performance Standards,
existing structures currently in use, such as homes and
buildings, would need to be condemned; and
d. The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands which do not include existing structures
currently in use, such as homes and buildings within the
upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements
of the Design and Performance Standards.
11. A waiver from strict compliance with the Township stormwater
management design and performance standards may be obtained
conditioned upon the positive recommendation of the Township
Engineer and the applicant paying their fair share towards the
implementation of the mitigation project(s) described in the
Municipal Stormwater Management Plan adopted March 9, 2005.
The mitigation project(s) to be funded shall be selected by the
Township Engineer and shall be implemented in the same HUC 14
drainage area as the proposed development. The exact amount of
the contribution shall be calculated by the Township Engineer and
shall be based on the cost to comply with the particular standard
§ 192-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-53
1:647
for which the waiver or waivers are requested in proportion to the
area/extent of site development proposed.
C. Nonstructural Stormwater Management Measures.
1. To the maximum extent practicable, the Design and Performance
Standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth in this Section into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified below into the design of a
particular project, the applicant shall identify the strategy
considered and provide a basis for the contention.
2. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the "time of concentration from preconstruction
to post construction;
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
(f) Minimize soil compaction;
(g) Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages
retention and planting of native vegetation and minimizes the
use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
(h) Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
(1) Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that comply with this Section's standards to control
passage of solid and floatable materials through storm
drain inlets;
§ 192-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 192-53
1:648
(2) Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
(3) Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
(4) When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(j) Swales may be constructed in which there need be no outlet
facilities and which will impound water drainage only from
other landscaped areas. The water impounded in these areas
will be left to evaporate and percolate and the swales shall
otherwise be seeded and maintained in lawn area. Minimum
slope if grass or rip rap shall be two (2) percent. Minimum
slope if concrete shall be .75 percent.
(k) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater
management measure to meet the Design and Performance
Standards shall be subject to a conservation restriction filed
with the Middlesex County Clerk's office, or subject to an
approved equivalent restriction that ensures that measure or
an equivalent stormwater management measure approved by
the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
D. Calculation of Stormwater Runoff and Groundwater Recharge.
1. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the
following:
a. The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following runoff coefficient calculation methods:
(1) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation
and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the
NRCS National Engineering Handbook Section 4
Hydrology and Technical Release 55 Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds; or
(2) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified
Rational Method for hydrograph computations.
b. For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and
groundwater recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction
condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded
land use with good hydrologic condition. A runoff coefficient or
a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition
may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer
§ 192-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-53
1:649
verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or
portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover
has existed on the site during the five years immediately prior
to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff
potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there
is the presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition
(if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park) with good
cover (if the land use type is woods) or with good hydrologic
condition and conservation treatment (if the land use type is
cultivation).
c. In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows,
or culverts, that may reduce pre-construction stormwater
runoff rates and volumes.
d. In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the
design engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff
rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces
separately to accurately compute the rates and volume of
stormwater runoff from the site.
e. If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater
management measure is below the flood hazard design flood
elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall
take into account the effects of tailwater in the design of
structural stormwater management measures.
2. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427 Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
E. Standards for Structural Stormwater Management Measures.
1. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
a. Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to take into account the existing site conditions,
including, for example, environmentally critical areas,
wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high
water table; soil type, permeability and texture; drainage area
and drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-prone
carbonate rocks (limestone).
§ 192-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 192-53
1:650
b. Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and
repairs, and ensure proper functioning.
c. Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed, constructed, and installed to be structurally sound,
durable, and corrosion resistant. Measures that are consistent
with the relevant portions of the Residential Site Improvement
Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to
meet this requirement.
d. At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management
basin, the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half
inches in diameter.
e. Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins
detailed herein.
f. The pipe size shall be determined by acceptable drainage
design procedures. In no case shall the pipe size in a surface
water drainage system be less than fifteen (15) inches in
diameter.
g. All pipe terminations shall be provided with poured concrete
headwalls or precast concrete end sections in accordance with
the approved preliminary plat or plan. Poured concrete
headwalls shall be wing-type headwalls with aprons and cut-off
walls in accordance with the construction details contained
herein. Flared end sections shall be provided with cut off walls.
h. Storm drain pipes running longitudinally along streets shall
not be located under curbing. They shall be reinforced
concrete pipe conforming to ASTM Designation C-76,
reinforced arch culvert conforming to ASTM Designation
C-506 or reinforced concrete elliptical pipe conforming to
ASTM Designation C-507. Joints shall be made with O-ring
rubber gaskets.
i. No concrete pipe shall be laid on grades exceeding ten (10%)
percent. Elliptical concrete storm drain pipes will be jointed
using a preformed bituminous mastic pressure-type joint
sealer.
j. All storm drains shall be laid in a straight line between inlets,
manholes or other structures, except that the use of the fittings
or factory curved or mitered pipe may be allowed by the
Township Engineer when necessary to accommodate existing
geometry or utilities.
k. Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash and
debris from drainage systems shall comply with the following
§ 192-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-53
1:651
standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials
through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this paragraph,
"solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash,
and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
(1) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
(a) The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
(b) A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven (7.0) square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inches across the
smallest dimension. Examples of grates subject to this
standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate
portion (noncurb-opening portion) of combination
inlets, grates on stormsewer manholes, ditch grates,
trench grates, and grates of spacer bars in slotted
drains. Examples of ground surfaces include surfaces
of roads (including bridges), driveways, parking areas,
bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open
channels, and stormwater basin floors.
l. Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, a NJDOT
Type "N-EcoCurb Piece" with "Dump No Waste, Drains To
Waterway" nameplate shall be utilized.
m. These standards which control passage of solid and floatable
materials through storm drain inlets do not apply in the
following instances:
(1) Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
(2) Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in this Chapter's Stormwater Runoff Quality
Standards are conveyed through any device (e.g., end of
pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment device, or a
catch basin hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to
prevent delivery of all solid and floatable materials that
could not pass through one of the following:
§ 192-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 192-53
1:652
(a) A rectangular space four and five-eighths inches long
and one and one-half inches wide (this option does not
apply for outfall netting facilities); or
(b) A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
(c) Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that
has parallel bars with one-inch (1") spacing between
the bars, to the elevation of the water quality design
storm as specified in this Chapter's Stormwater
Runoff Quality Standards; or
(d) Where the NJDEP, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c),
that action to meet this standard is an undertaking
that constitutes an encroachment or will damage or
destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic
property.
2. Stormwater management guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by this ordinance.
3. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the
Stormwater Quality requirements of this ordinance, provided the
pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation
for Advanced Technology and certified by the Department.
F. Erosion Control, Groundwater Recharge and Runoff Quantity Design
and Performance Standards.
1. This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
a. The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
b. The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors
for Stormwater Runoff and Groundwater Recharge
calculations within this Chapter, either:
(1) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that the site and its stormwater management measures
§ 192-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-53
1:653
maintain 100 percent of the average annual preconstruction
groundwater recharge volume for the site; or
(2) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that the increase of stormwater runoff volume from preconstruction
to post-construction for the 2-year storm is
infiltrated.
This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within an "urban redevelopment area".
c. The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
(1) Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading; areas
where recharge would be inconsistent with Department
approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan
and areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials, such
as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities; and
(2) Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material."
d. The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid adverse
hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic impacts
include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or
seasonally high water table so as to cause surficial ponding,
flooding of basements, or interference with the proper
operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other
subsurface structures in the vicinity or downgradient of the
groundwater recharge area.
2. In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the design
engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for Stormwater
Runoff calculations within this Chapter, complete one of the
following:
a. Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction runoff
hydrographs for the two, 10, and 100-year storm events do not
exceed, at any point in time, the pre-construction runoff
hydrographs for the same storm events;
b. Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that
there is no increase, as compared to the pre-construction
condition, in the peak runoff rates of stormwater leaving the
site for the two, 10, and 100-year storm events and that the
increased volume or change in timing of stormwater runoff will
not increase flood damage at or downstream of the site. This
analysis shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land
uses and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage area;
§ 192-53 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 192-53
1:654
c. Design stormwater management measures so that the postconstruction
peak runoff rates for the 2, 10 and 100 year storm
events are 50, 75 and 80 percent, respectively, of the
preconstruction peak runoff rates. The percentages apply only
to the post-construction stormwater runoff that is attributable
to the portion of the site on which the proposed development
or project is to be constructed. The percentages shall not be
applied to post-construction stormwater runoff into tidal flood
hazard areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will
not increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
d. In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity analysis
in accordance with (1), (2) and (3) above shall only be applied if
the increased volume of stormwater runoff could increase flood
damages below the point of discharge.
G. Calculations for Stormwater Runoff Quality.
1. Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80 percent of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of non-structural and structural stormwater management
measures.

2. For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain Stormwater Best
Management Practices (BMP) designed in accordance with the
New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. TSS
reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the
BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of
calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer
provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these
alternative rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any
approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate
shall be provided to the following address: Division of Watershed
Management, NJDEP, PO Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey,
08625-0418.
3. If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
80 percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the
following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B B (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs,
and
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

4. If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the 80 percent TSS
removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff
from the subareas converge on site in which case the removal rate
can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted
average.
5. Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the Design and Performance standards listed herein.
6. Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual.
7. In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
H. Safety Standards for Stormwater Management Basins.

(1) If the maintenance plan identifies a party other than the
developer (for example, a public agency or homeowners'
association) as having the responsibility for maintenance,
the plan shall include documentation of such party's
agreement to assume this responsibility, or of the
developer's obligation to dedicate a stormwater
management facility to such party under an applicable
ordinance or regulation.
(2) Responsibility for maintenance shall not be assigned or
transferred to the owner or tenant of an individual
property in a residential development or project, unless
such owner or tenant owns or leases the entire residential
development or project.
(3) If maintenance is not the responsibility of a public agency,
the maintenance plan and any future revisions shall be
recorded upon the deed of record for each property on
which the maintenance described in the maintenance plan

J. Private Storm Drain Inlet Retrofitting Required. [Added 7-20-09 by
Ord. No. 09-16]
1. Private Storm Drain Inlets - Existing storm drain inlets which are in
direct contact with repaving, repairing, reconstruction, or
resurfacing or alterations of facilities on private property shall be
required to be retrofitted to prevent the discharge of solids and
floatables (such as plastic bottles, cans, food wrappers and other
litter) to the municipal separate storm sewer system so as to
protect public health, safety and welfare, and to prescribe penalties
for the failure to comply.
2. Applicability - For the purpose of this retrofitting requirement
"Storm Drain Inlets" means an opening in a storm drain used to
collect stormwater runoff and includes but not limited to, a grate
inlet, curb-opening inlet, slotted inlet, and combination inlet.
3. Prohibited Conduct - No person in control of private property
(except a residential lot with one single family house) shall
authorize the repaving, repairing (excluding the repair of
individual potholes), resurfacing (including top coating or chip
sealing with asphalt emulsion or a thin base of hot bitumen),
reconstructing or altering any surface that is in direct contact with
an existing storm drain inlet on that property unless the storm
drain inlet:
a. Already meets the private storm drain inlet design standards
cited in Section 4 below to control passage of solid and
floatable materials; or
b. Is retrofitted or replaced to meet the standard cited in Section
4 below prior to the completion of the project.
4. Design Standards - Private storm drain inlets which are in direct
contact with repaving, repairing, reconstruction, or resurfacing or
alterations of facilities on private property shall comply with the
following standards. For purposes of this paragraph, "solid and
floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash, and other
floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
a. The following grates shall be used whenever a grate in
pavement or another ground surface is used to collect
stormwater from that surface into a storm drain or surface
water body under that grate:
1) The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
§ 192-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-53
1:661

both the customer and utility, except when the meter has been
found to be inaccurate. In such cases, the quantity may be
determined as provided under § 218-10G and 218-20A2 and 3.
(2) Any customer that disputes a bill rendered by the Utility for water
shall bring the disputed bill to the attention of the Revenue Office
of the Utility within 15 days of the issuance of the bill. Said dispute
shall be presented to the office of the Revenue Official in writing,
stating the exact portion of the bill that is in dispute and the
reasons why the bill is in dispute.
(3) Upon receipt of a disputed bill claim by a customer, the Collector of
Revenue shall present a temporary estimated bill to the customer
which shall be computed on the basis of the average usage during
the preceding twelve-month period or the usage during the same
period of time in the preceding year, whichever, in the estimation of
the Collector of Revenue, presents a more-accurate estimate. The
customer shall pay the amount of the temporary estimated bill
within the same time limits for payment of the original bill.
(4) The Collector of Revenue shall investigate the bill dispute
presented by the customer and shall receive whatever supporting
evidence the customer may wish to present and shall determine
whether the disputed bill is valid or is invalid in whole or in part. In
the event that the Collector of Revenue determines that any or all
of the disputed bill is due, and that amount exceeds the amount
paid by the customer under the temporary estimated bill, the

Chapter 219
difference shall be paid by the customer within 14 days after
notification, in writing, by the Collector of Revenue. After said
fourteen-day period, the bill shall be classified as delinquent and
shall be processed as covered under § 218-20A and B of this
chapter.
(5) No abatement on meter bills will be made for leaks, or for water
wasted by damaged or defective fixtures.
B. Lien for unpaid water charges. In accordance with the laws of the State
of New Jersey, all charges for water and all other municipal charges
provided in this chapter, including penalties, shall be a lien upon the
property on account of which the charge is incurred until paid.
C. Penalty for bad checks. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:62-77, a penalty will be
imposed upon water customers attempting to pay water bills with
checks which are returned due to insufficient funds, which penalty shall
be in the amount of $20 for each such check.
A. "Asset management" is based upon GASB (Government Accounting
Standards Board) Accounting Statement #34 or future amendment
which deals with fixed assets. The East Brunswick Water Utility and
private-sector companies use accrual accounting which measures the
current liability but also long-term asset liabilities. Examples of such
are capital assets, infrastructure and general obligation debt. The
concept of utilizing GASB #34 for Asset Management is to have our
tanks in such condition there is zero depreciation. Zero depreciation
means the tanks and ground reservoir are in like-new condition at all
times. To accomplish this requires a sound program and consistent
funding to protect these valuable assets.
(1) In accordance with N.J.S.A. 58:26-23, known as the "New Jersey
Water Supply Public Private Contracting Act," the Township is
permitted to sign a long-term contract with a qualified company
based upon compliance with the statuary provisions.
(2) The management of the maintenance contract will be under the
responsibilities of the Director of Water Utility in accordance with
the standard operating procedures.
(3) The New Jersey Water Supply Public Private Contracting Act
permits contracts to be signed for a period of 50 years, which shall
be controlled by the Township Council and the passage of
appropriate resolutions upon proper compliance with the Public
Private Contracting Act.

Environmental Protection, U.S.E.P.A., the Middlesex County Utilities
Authority, and/or the East Brunswick Superintendent.
M. Air conditioning units. Air conditioning units will not be permitted to
discharge clean water into a sanitary sewer. Recirculation devices shall
be used, or excess water shall be discharged to a separate point of
disposal. Similarly, there shall be no discharge to a sanitary sewer from
other sources of clean water, as determined by the Utility, such as
condensate pumps, cooling towers, etc.
N. Grease traps. Grease traps will be required on all food service
establishment discharges, or on discharges from any facility which is
expected to release quantities of grease and oil in excess of that of
domestic waste. The type and manufacture of grease traps must be
approved by the Superintendent before installation. The sizing of
grease traps will be based upon the following criteria. Each applicant
for a new grease or oil producing installation, and each existing user of
the Utility system when requested, shall furnish the following
information:
(1) Description of establishment, including number of employees,
number of patrons, number of seats, frequency of seating, and type

establishment, in order for adequate cleaning and maintenance
techniques to be utilized. The Utility may waive this requirement
in the event of unusual hardship or other technical difficulty. The
decision on the location of the grease trap on the interior or
exterior of the building shall be solely that of the Utility.
§ 219-4 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-4
1:820
§ 219-5. Sewer Main Extensions.
Specifications for grease traps are as follows: Grease trap
chambers shall be constructed of non-corrosive materials, such
as fiberglass. The chambers, if installed on the exterior of the
building, shall be capable of sustaining 10 ton truck H2O loading,
and shall have baffles and fittings made of non-corrosive materials.
Access shall be available through 24" manhole frames and covers
located at each end of the chamber. Units shall be equal to the
product of Tyler pipe (Tyler, Texas), Town and Country (as
distributed by Trap Zap of South Norwalk, Connecticut), or Zurn
Industries (Erie, Pennsylvania) green Turtle.
Installation of grease traps shall meet the recommendations of the
Plumbing and Drainage Institute, including locations, flow control
and venting. Grease Trap installation will also require a plumbing
permit and compliance with Township plumbing code regulations.
Sampling manholes for food service establishments shall be
installed downstream of the grease trap, but upstream of any
interconnection of bathroom sanitary service line and shall be
inspected by the Superintendent.
To obtain optimum operating efficiency of a grease interceptor, a
regular schedule of maintenance must be adhered to. All grease
interceptors must be cleaned regularly. The frequency of grease
removal is dependent upon the capacity of the interceptor and the
quantity of grease in the waste water. Grease removal intervals
may vary from once a week to once in several weeks. When the
grease removal interval has been determined for a specific
installation, regular cleaning at that interval is necessary to
maintain the rated efficiency of the interceptor. After this
accumulated grease and waste material has been removed, the
interceptor should be thoroughly checked to make sure that the
inlet, outlet and air relief ports are clear of obstructions.
A. General provisions. Persons proposing subdivisions or developments
requiring a main extension for sewer service shall prepare applications
described in this section with the necessary supporting documents. The
policy of the Utility is to permit extensions only when paid for and
installed by the applicant. No facilities for collection, treatment or
disposal of sewage within the "district" of the Utility (which
corresponds with the boundaries of the Township) shall be constructed
unless the Utility shall give its consent and the Superintendent shall
approve Contract plans and specifications therefor.
It is the policy of the Utility to charge connection fees for connection
to its sewer system following the rates set forth in the Utility's Rate
Schedule. The connection fee is charged per Service Unit.
Connection fees shall be payable prior to submission of Application
unless specific arrangements are agreed upon. If payment is not
§ 219-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-5
1:821
received within this period, the project may not proceed and the
connection fee shall be at the prevailing rate at the time of receipt
of the check. The applicant shall also be subject to any change in
regulations. If the project is to be constructed in sections the
connection fees may be paid for each section prior to application for
acceptance of each section, at the prevailing connection fee at the time
of each section's acceptance.
Unless otherwise approved, where locations do not front the sanitary
sewer, residential subdivisions containing three or more building sites
or lots or any residential structure to be used by three or more families,
regardless of volume of flow, and all nonresidential developments such
as schools, commercial buildings, industrial buildings and other
structures will be required to install a sanitary sewer system to be
connected with the nearest existing sanitary sewer in the Township.
Exceptions may be made only where:
(1) Developments lie within the Septic System Management Area
formed by the Township (where special requirements are imposed),
or,
(2) The applicant will not create an environmental hazard.
(3) The applicant obtains a certification from the Superintendent that
mandatory connection is not required under existing municipal law.
For residential subdivisions not fronting on a sanitary sewer and
containing two or less building sites or lots, or if the lands are
deemed by the Utility to be too remote from any existing facilities,
consideration will be given to an individual sewage system with a
dry sanitary sewer system or approved alternative for future use in
lieu of connection to existing facilities.
Any main extension and related facilities (other than industrial
septic systems) installed under the provisions of this section, or
easement required for the purpose, shall be transferred to the
Utility as hereinafter described.
During construction but before final acceptance, the Utility shall
have the right to use any completed portion of the system without
waiving its right to further inspection or testing or to order
correction of any defects provided the Utility does not
unreasonably delay inspection, testing and acceptance of that
portion of the system.
Use of the sanitary sewer system for the discharge of sump pumps,
or drainage from cellar drains, leaders, downspouts, drainage tile,
cooling system drains and other similar discharges shall not be
permitted.
Unpolluted industrial cooling waters and unpolluted drainage shall
be discharged into a storm sewer or natural outlet.
§ 219-5 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-5
1:822
Easements will be required for sewers not located within an
existing public right-of-way. The width of such easements will be
determined by the Superintendent, depending on the size and
depth of sewer to be located in the easement.
Easements must be extended to the nearest adjacent property if
future service will be required.
Easement documents must be in a form acceptable to the Township
Attorney, and must incorporate the following language:
No fill, material, machinery, appliances, or similar objects may be
placed on the said premises which will impose an additional loading
in excess of 100 lbs. per square inch (100 lbs/sq. inch) without
the prior written approval of the Utility. Provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit the ability of
grantors to use the land over the easement for the storage of
vehicles.
No trees may be planted on the easement within ten feet on either
side of the location of the sewer line. Said trees shall not grow more
than ten feet tall. Other types of shrubbery may be planted within
the easement area, however, the same five foot distance from either
side of the location of the pipe must be adhered to. No fences
may be placed on or around the easement that preclude Utility
access. No utilities may be placed across the easement without
Superintendent approval; such approval will not be unreasonably
withheld provided there is no hazard or exceptional impeding of
access to Utility facilities. The Superintendent must be given
adequate notice of any surface construction on or over the
easement area.
B. Applications  general. A sequence of applications for sewer
extensions are required for the Utility's determination of needs,
availability of service, effect of proposed extension, and inspection of
installed extension. Application forms are available from the Utility. No
application will be considered unless a Professional Engineer
registered in the State of New Jersey is in charge of the planning and
design of the proposed sewerage facilities and has affixed his seal and
signature to the submissions. Each application shall be submitted in
duplicate with the designated fees to the Utility not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the Planning Board meeting at which action on the
application is desired.
Applications shall be signed by the property owner. If the property
owner is a partnership, applications shall be signed by a general
partner, or in the case of a corporation, by an officer of the corporation.
Signature of agent, attorney or engineer is not acceptable.
Each application must be accompanied by those fees, deposits and
guarantees described herein, or in the section on Fees and Charges.
All fees accompanying applications shall be cash, certified check or
§ 219-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-5
1:823
acceptable other draft at the option of the Utility. (For standard
applications, see § 219-11(A))
The review and inspection fees shall be placed in an escrow fund,
with interest as required by law, from which expenses will be paid by
voucher. If so required by the Utility, additional deposits shall be made
by the Applicant to meet expenses; surplus funds shall be returned to
the Applicant after payment of all fees and after final acceptance of the
facility by the Utility. The Applicant will be required to pay all costs
incurred by the Utility on his project.
Where deposits or guarantees are based on estimated construction
costs, a submission shall be made by the Applicant's engineer and
verified by the Superintendent. The approved construction cost shall
be based on the estimated period of construction and shall include all
on-site and off-site work; and for bonding purposes a 20% contingency
allowance will be added.
Inspection work by the Township, its employees, engineer or agents
is intended only to review compliance of the work with the approved
design documents. These inspections or lack thereof are not intended
to review safety precautions, adherence to State or Federal regulations,
or hazards to the public, contractor employees, or third parties. Each
applicant assumes full responsibility for damages or injuries caused on
its work sites, and agrees to indemnify and provide separate defense
for the Township and representatives against all actions or claims.
Where off-site facilities are involved, the following policies shall prevail:
(1) The Applicant is considered responsible for providing off-site
facilities to provide capacity for his development.
(2) The design of off-site facilities is to be undertaken by the Applicant,
and shall be subject to design standards established by the Utility
and subject to review of the Engineer and approval of the
Superintendent. The off-site design is based upon the total
community needs, rather than capacity for the development alone.
The design parameters shall be provided to the Applicant by the
Utility.
(3) Where the Utility requires additional capacity for areas outside of
the development, it will assume any increment of cost for service to
such areas.
(4) Off-site facilities shall be installed by the Applicant, and shall be
subject to design standards established by the Utility and subject to
review of the Engineer and approval of the Superintendent. The
Applicant's share of the costs must be available to finance the
initial construction (i.e. the Utility should not be required to finance
the Applicant's share) unless specific alternate arrangements are
approved by the Utility.
§ 219-5 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-5
1:824
(5) The Utility's share of off-site facilities may be credited against
connection fees. If the Utility's share exceeds the total of all
connection fees, a lump sum payment may be made toward the
cost.
(6) All approved and accepted on-site and off-site facilities installed by
the Applicant shall be transferred to the Utility, where they lie in
public rights of way or easements. Said transfer of facilities must
take place prior to the release of performance guarantees.
C. Application for conceptual review -two or more residential units. An
application describing the proposed residential, commercial, or
industrial development, or other project, shall be submitted to the
Superintendent with supporting data to determine the economic and
technical feasibility of extending sewer service. This application shall
be submitted concurrent with filing of conceptual sub-division or site
plan application with the East Brunswick Planning Board or Zoning
Board. The Superintendent may defer or waive certain parts of this
supporting data at its discretion where the cost of data preparation is
excessive for the development or project planning and approvals.
Approval of this application shall extend for a period not to exceed one
year from date of approval.
In addition to the application, the Applicant shall furnish two (2) copies
of a general location plan (min. scale 1" = 100') showing streams,
streets, lots, blocks and tax map numbers, copy of application
submitted to the Planning Board, location of any existing water
distribution and/or sanitary systems in the area, proposed system
outline and route of construction, and estimated quality and volume of
flow. Elevations shall be based on the Township datum (NAVD 88).
The Superintendent shall analyze the submitted application and
supporting data and report to the Applicant the Utility's
recommendations and/or findings. These findings may be furnished to
the Township Planning or Zoning Board as support material.
If the Superintendent determines that portions of the existing
downstream system do not have sufficient capacity to accept flow from
the proposed development, then the Utility may require payment for,
or the construction of, supplementary off-site facilities to accommodate
the additional flow. Costs shall include all engineering and overhead
costs.

(1) State D.E.P. approval to construct.
(2) Performance guarantees, as hereinafter specified.
(3) Insurance certificates, with coverage as hereinafter specified.
(4) Schedule of construction.
(5) Payment for off-site facilities.
Approval of construction by the Utility will be void and invalid after
one (1) year unless substantial construction has commenced on the
approved facilities. Where construction has commenced within the one
(1) year period, approval will be automatically renewed for a successive
one (1) year period, after which a request must be filed for an extension
of time. Should a project not commence substantial construction within
the one (1) year period, the application as indicated shall become void
and invalid and will require a renewal application to EBSU.
A renewal application fee shall be charged. Should the application
be resubmitted in its previous form, without need for change, the
application may then be renewed by the Utility without system
condition, or in the EBSU Rules and Regulations, an entirely new
review, with the appropriate fees, may be required. It shall not be
necessary for EBSU to notify an applicant that his time period has
expired, that will be the responsibility of the applicant. Application shall
be required upon the expiration of any of the above noted time periods.
Capacity in the system will not be reserved unless, a) the Utility
approval is still valid, and b) all connection fees are paid.
F. Application for performance guarantee reduction/release. Upon

applicant shall request that the Superintendent approve the installed
system (or part thereof).
Ownership, maintenance and operation of the system shall be the
responsibility of the Utility only after specific written final acceptance
by the Superintendent of all or part of the system. Until this written
final acceptance is issued by the Utility, the ownership, maintenance
and operation shall remain the responsibility of the Applicant. However,
operation of the system may not commence until a permit for operation
is issued by the Utility and notification has been sent to the State
Department of Environmental Protection. The applicant will be subject
to all and any payments of any fines, levies and/or assessments prior
to the final acceptance of the ownership of the system by the
Superintendent.
The application shall be accompanied by:
(1) Two (2) copies of as-built plans (as described hereinafter), one of
which must be reproducible prepared and certified by the
applicant's engineer and approved by the Superintendent.
§ 219-5 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-5
1:828

the Utility (or a suitable Township Inspector's report on the
complaint).
(8) A signed voucher for release of cash bond.
Upon recommendation of the Superintendent, a partial reduction
in the performance guarantee may be approved by the Utility. Such
reduction will apply only to the Bond or Letter of Credit; no portion
of the cash bond will be returned until full and final Performance
Bond Release has been approved.
A Maintenance Bond shall be posted upon approval of Performance
Bond Release.
G. Performance guarantee and insurance. A performance guarantee
satisfactory in form to the Utility, in the amount of least 120% of the
total approved construction cost of that portion of the project covered
by the application, shall be furnished with the application to construct
(Form C). The guarantee shall contain an "evergreen" clause, and shall
remain in full force and effect for the duration of construction and until
release is approved by the Utility. The guarantee shall assure the Utility
of complete acceptable construction, and shall further guarantee that
said construction will be in accordance with the Rates, Rules, and
Regulations of the Utility, the plans and specifications and Engineer's
Report and cost estimate approved by the Superintendent. The
approved guarantee shall be in the form of a 90% performance
guarantee by approved surety and 10% cash or certified check. The
amount of the required performance guarantee may be increased for
due cause by the Utility, including periods of construction extending
more than one (1) year. In the event of default or non-performance by a
developer, as determined solely by the Utility, part or all of the
performance guarantee may be applied by the Utility to completion of
the work. NO WORK MAY BEGIN ON AN APPROVED PROJECT UNTIL
A PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND
ACCEPTED BY THE UTILITY.
§ 219-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-5
1:829
H. Construction procedures. No construction may start without
"authorization to construct" from the Superintendent, a "permit to
construct" from the State Department of Environmental Protection, and
a minimum one (1) weeks' notice to the Utility of intention to start work.
During construction, the Utility intends to have personnel present on
the site to observe the installation of sewerage facilities. The purpose
of such observations will be only to achieve an acceptable installation
and will not incur any responsibility for safety practices on the site, or
liability for injury or damage caused by the contractor's operations. The
cost of such observation shall be borne by the applicant.
Work will be rejected for the following reasons:
(1) It is performed or backfilled without observation by Utility
personnel or representative,
(2) It is performed after the Utility's authorized agent disapproves the
materials or the method of installation, or
(3) It fails to pass the testing requirements stipulated elsewhere in
these regulation.
Work will be approved only after final observations, testing,
corrective work, approval of restoration by the Township and
property owners, and written certification by the Superintendent.
The Superintendent reserve the right to stop work on the project, if
materials, workmanship, or operations are not in conformance with
specifications or Utility regulations. Failure to stop work may result
in the following:
(a) Rejection of all work.
(b) Notification to surety that performance guarantees are being
violated.
(c) Notification to Township that issuance of building permits and
certificates of occupancy should be terminated.
(d) Police action if work is being performed in public rights-of-way
or in a manner detrimental to the public welfare.
The contractor, builder, and all subcontractors must abide by
the requirements of the State Construction Safety Code, and
the OSHA regulations. Neither the Utility nor its engineer or
agents are responsible for adherence to such regulations, or
for other safety precautions related to the project.
If there is any portion of the project left in a hazardous
condition, or if reasonable orders issued by the Utility or its
engineer are not followed, the Utility reserves the right to use
the cash portion of the performance guarantees to rectify the
§ 219-5 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-5
1:830
condition. Five (5) days written notice of such intention will be
issued by the Superintendent to the Applicant and his surety,
unless hazards to the public require more urgent action. If the
cash funds are inadequate, additional funds must be posted, or
the Utility may demand action by surety.
I. Maintenance bond. Prior to final release of the performance guarantee
the Applicant shall submit a maintenance bond from acceptable surety,
in form approved by the Superintendent. The bond shall be in the
amount of 15% of the original approved construction cost estimate, and
shall extend for two (2) years from the date of the resolution releasing
the performance guarantee, and until an acceptable final inspection. No
partial maintenance bonds will be accepted.
J. As-Built Plans (Land Use § 132-54). Prior to bond release for all
residential and all other sewer improvements, "as-built" drawings shall
be submitted to the Utility. As-built plans shall be submitted on plastic
film as well as a CAD generated data file (compatible with the most
current version of AutoCAD) with a scale of greater than 1" = 50". All
submittals must be referenced to the N.J. State Plane coordinate system
of 1983 and the NAVD of 1988. As built plans shall include the
following:

sewerage facilities installed as shown herein are hereby dedicated to
the East Brunswick Sewer Utility, upon acceptance."
Drawing Materials - mylar or linen reproducibles (one set) and blue-line
prints (two sets) upon final acceptance.
A. Individual connections and service lines. Following are the types of
individual connections anticipated into the Utility's system:
(1) Resumption of service through an existing building sewer and
house connection (including change of ownership or type of
service).
(2) Installation of a new building sewer from a structure to an existing
house connection on the Utility's system.
(3) A new building sewer and a new house connection tapping into the
Utility's system.
B. Permits and applications. All individual connections to the Utility's
system, whether using existing or new facilities, must apply for a permit
for connection of the sanitary sewer into the existing EBSU system.
For all commercial or industrial connections to the Utility's system,
whether using existing or new facilities, an application must be
submitted titled "Application for Individual Commercial Sewer
Service", together with detailed plumbing plans and supporting data
as may be required. In addition, the Utility may require submission
of "Application for Industrial Sewer Connection and Agreement for
Industrial Wastes".
Applications must be signed by the property owner and the customer
requesting service, with both parties accepting financial and legal
responsibility for the connection and its use. The accepted application
§ 219-5 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-6
1:832
will constitute a contract between the Utility and the Applicant,
obligating the Applicant to pay the Utility's established rates, and to
comply with the Utility's rules and regulations.
All applications must receive the approval of the Superintendent before
the installation is started. All installations must be inspected and
receive the approval of the Superintendent before service is furnished.
An "Application for Change of Use in Existing Sewerage Facilities"
must be made upon any change in service from that described in the
original application or upon any change in ownership of a commercial
or industrial property. The new customer shall be responsible for
making application for approval by the Superintendent, before sewage
service is received or continued. There will be no charge for filing
applications for change in type of service, unless special review or
analysis is required.
Applications for new construction shall be accompanied by two sets
of plans prepared by a registered plumber or approved contractor,
showing the proposed line from the structure to the Utility main or
the location of the existing line to be used. Plans must include all
elevations.
The applicant must obtain and file permits for openings in State, County
or Township roads as required. The applicant must pay all fees, provide
bonds or deposits, insurance, and meet all traffic and safety
requirements.
No applications for service will be accepted by the Utility until the
applicant has paid, or made satisfactory arrangements to pay, all
arrears and charges at the subject premises, or due by the applicant at
any premises now or heretofore occupied by them.
Application for new service connections will be accepted subject to
there being existing mains in streets or right-of-way abutting the
premises to be served, and subject to there being sufficient capacity
available.
When a property owner has made application for a new service, or
has applied for the reinstatement of an existing service, it shall be
presumed that the piping and fixtures on the applicant's premises are
in good condition. The Utility will not be liable, in any event, for any
accident, breaks, or leakage arising in any way in connection with the
pipes or fixtures of the customer, nor for any damage to the property
which may result from the usage thereof.
Building Sewers are under the jurisdiction of the East Brunswick Sewer
Utility and the East Brunswick Plumbing Inspector. Approval of the
Plumbing Inspector or a Certificate of Occupancy will be required
before the Utility will accept discharge of sewage into its mains.
§ 219-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-6
1:833
An Application for Disconnection of Sewerage Facilities" must be filed
prior to disconnection.
C. Utility responsibility. New connections to existing sewer mains will be
at the expense of the Applicant - (see definition), including tapping (if
approved by the Utility), fittings, pipe, labor and related materials.
Such new connections and laterals will become the property of the
Utility to the property line or easement line. The Utility will maintain
such new connection and new laterals from the sewer main to the
property right-of-way (depending on the location of the sewer main)
after installation, and after inspection and approval by the
Superintendent together with the Township Plumbing Inspector. Utility
maintenance will be for failure of material only. If stoppage is due to
material originating from the premises served, the owner will be billed
for the repair.
D. Size and kind of house connection or building sewer. The
Superintendent reserves the right to determine the size and kind of
service lateral from the main to the property right-of-way or easement
line, from the property line to the structure to be served, or from the
main in the right-of-way to the structure to be served. The materials,
location and installation procedures shall conform to the latest
"Specifications for Sewer Construction" on file at the Township office,
or to the requirements of the Engineer. A vented inspection and
maintenance riser is required behind the curb or at an approved
location on each house connection, as per standard Utility details.
That portion of the building sewer, service lateral and sewer clean-out
installed and maintained by the owner shall be installed in accordance
with the applicable Plumbing Code and the Utility specifications, and
shall be inspected and approved by the Township Plumbing Inspector
and Superintendent prior to backfilling the trench. Any construction
not approved shall be immediately removed and reconstructed in an
approved manner.
E. Building sewer location. No building sewer shall be laid within five (5)
feet of any gas pipe, water service or any other facility of any public
utility company, nor within five (5) feet of any open excavation, vault or
meter pit; nor shall the location be under any sidewalk or driveway
unless approved. All building sewers shall be installed within the limits
of the customer's property and a minimum of three (3) feet from any
property line(s) or building walls. Landscaping shall be located so as to
minimize root intrusion into the building sewer, and in no event shall
trees be placed within five (5) feet of any building sewer.
F. Elevation of sanitary fixtures. Under no circumstances shall any new
sanitary fixtures be installed in a building at an elevation lower than the
front curb elevation or street centerline elevation (whichever is higher)
unless special precautions are incorporated into the new fixture
installation to prevent surcharging of the new fixture from the sanitary
sewer main because of high flows or a blockage. In any event the Utility
§ 219-6 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-6
1:834
will not be responsible for any backups or surcharges into fixtures or
structures.
Prior to installation of any fixture which may be lower than the
elevation heretofore specified, the owner shall obtain the approval of
the Township Plumbing Inspector and the Superintendent on the type
of precautions that will be taken to eliminate the potential flooding of
premises with sewage. In the event a fixture is found to be installed
at any point lower than heretofore specified, the Utility may revoke
the sewer connection permit or discontinue service until the fixture is
removed or positive control measures are instituted to eliminate any
potential surcharging of the building with sewerage.
Special protective devices, such as check valves, shall also be
incorporated in building sewers, where the lowest fixture is below the
rim of the next upstream manhole.
G. Maintenance by customer. All house connections, building sewers,
sewer clean-outs and fixtures furnished by the customer or the Utility
shall be maintained by the customer in good order, and all piping and
connections furnished and owned by the Utility and on the property of
the customer shall be protected properly and cared for by the customer.
All leaks in the building sewer or other pipe or fixture in or upon the
premises served must be repaired immediately by the owner or
occupant of the premises. The customer shall be responsible for
notifying the Utility of the party engaged by said customer to do any
maintenance work on the customer's building sewer, prior to work
being commenced, and said party shall not backfill any trench until the
work has been inspected and approved by the Superintendent. Any
work not acceptable shall be immediately removed and replaced by
work which is acceptable.
The Utility shall in no way be responsible for maintaining any portion
of the building sewer owned by the customer, or for damage done by
sewage escaping therefrom; or for lines or fixtures on the customer's
property; and the customer shall at all times comply with the applicable
municipal regulations with respect thereto, and make changes therein,
required by reason of changes of grade, relocation of mains or
otherwise. The owner shall be responsible for all stoppages within the
house connection and the building sewer from the building to the main,
if caused by discharge from the buildings on the site.
H. Prohibited connections. Under no circumstances may any of the
following be connected to the sanitary sewers, either directly or
indirectly:
(1) Foundation underdrains, or sump pumps.
(2) Area drain or yard drain.
(3) Rain conductor or down spout.
§ 219-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-6

(7) Drains from pieces of equipment or manufacturing process, except
when specifically authorized under the provisions of these Rules
and Regulations.
I. Special connections. Building sewers and house connections to public
buildings, churches, apartment houses, commercial establishments,
and industrial establishments, shall be installed to conform to detailed
plans and specifications approved by the Superintendent.
J. Property served by single building sewer. A building sewer from the
curb, easement line or right-of-way line to a property, shall not serve
more than one building unless otherwise approved. Upon proper
application of the owner, a property may be served by two or more
building sewers, each of which, for billing purposes, may be considered
as being one customer account.
K. Single building sewer with two or more customers. Where two or more
customers are now served through a single building sewer, any
violation of the rules of the Utility, with respect to either or any of said
customers, shall be deemed a violation as to all, and unless said
violation is corrected after reasonable notice, the Utility may take such
action as may be taken for a single customer. However, such action will
not be taken until a customer who has not violated the Utility's rules has
been given a reasonable opportunity to connect his pipe to a separately
controlled building sewer.
L. Policy on blockage and repairs. Following is the policy of the Utility with
regard to procedures for repairs of building sewers and house
connections to the Utility's system:
(1) In the event of a stoppage or failure in a building sewer or house
connection, the property owner shall be responsible for
endeavoring to correct the situation and for obtaining a
measurement to the point of stoppage or failure.
(2) If the problem is found to exist between the property line or
easement line and the house or building, then the property owner
shall be responsible for proceeding with all necessary corrective
work.
(3) If the problem is found to exist between the property line or
easement line and the main sewer, then the Utility shall be
responsible for proceeding with all necessary corrective work.
(4) If the work is performed by the Utility and it is found that the
problem has been caused by faulty use of the sewer by the property
§ 219-6 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-6
1:836
owner, such as discharge of bulky materials, discharge of acids,
etc., then all costs must be borne by the property owner, including
the costs of labor of any Utility personnel and costs of equipment
and materials provided by the Utility, and shall be paid promptly by
the property owner to the Utility. If not paid promptly, the amount
of said costs shall be added on to the next sewer bill submitted to
the property owner.
(5) Under no circumstances shall the Utility be responsible for damage
to furnishings or house or building interiors unless negligence on
the part of the Utility is demonstrated.
M. Policy on missing or damaged curb clean-out caps. When an Utility
inspection indicates that a sewer cap or clean-out is missing or
damaged, the customer will be notified that the facility must be
repaired or cover replaced, within 72 hours (3 days). After that time
period, the Utility will replace or repair the clean-out or cap and the
customer will be charged for parts and service.
N. Unauthorized connection. No person(s) shall uncover, make any
connection with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer,
service lateral or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written
permit from the Utility.
O. Floor drains. The connection of floor drains to the sewer system may be
permitted by the Utility, on a case by case basis, subject to but not
limited to the following criteria:
(1) No interconnection of storm water drains with the sanitary sewer
system will be permitted.
(2) Assurances must be provided by all current and future owners of
the property, that discharges into the floor drains will never include
waste oil, gasoline, coolant, anti-freeze, brake and transmission
fluids, paint, volatile or explosive liquids. Also, no discharge of any
item prohibited by USEPA, NJDEP, MCUA or EBSU regulations
shall be permitted. The property owner shall be responsible to
determine restricted items. Such assurances may include deed
restrictions, affidavits, annual permits, or other forms of assurance
determined by the Utility.
(3) Any floor drain located below street level will be required to have a
check valve installed prior to connection to the sewer system. The
property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the
check valve.
(4) The property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
floor drains.
(5) Notices are to be prominently posted and maintained, by the owner,
instructing the building occupants as to the restrictions on floor
§ 219-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-6
1:837
drain use. Such notices must be maintained and replaced or
updated when necessary.
(6) A grease, oil, and sand separator will be required on the outlet pipe
from the floor drains as required in § 219-4(E) of these regulations,
unless waived by the Utility. The above noted devices will be
located outside of any structure or building and subject to
inspection by the Utility. An approved clean-out must be installed
between the above described devices and the property line, prior to
connection to the sewer system.
(7) Additional pre-treatment units, controls, access manholes and
special facilities may be required for specific installations.
(8) The Utility will conduct monthly tests of flow, utilizing a NJDEP
approved laboratory. All costs will be borne by the property owner,
including surcharge billing.
(9) The Utility reserves the right to order or disconnect floor drains
from the sewer system for repeated violations of these rules and
regulations.
(10) Any floor drains in existence prior to the adoption of this regulation
shall be required to conform to the terms of this section.
P. Swimming pool connections. The connection of swimming pools to the
sewer system may be permitted by the Utility on a case by case basis
after application, inspection and approval by the Superintendent. Such
approval will be conditioned upon the following matters:
(1) The only acceptable discharge will be from the pool contents, from
treatment system backwash, and from restrooms. No discharge of
other wastes will be permitted, particularly from but not limited to
cleaning fluids, acid wash solutions, filter sand, leaves, twigs or
other materials which would otherwise not be acceptable into the
sanitary sewer system of the Utility.
(2) In order to limit the rate of discharge, the maximum pipe size for
connection to the Utility system will be two-inch (2") diameter cast
iron or polyvinyl chloride pipe for gravity systems. The maximum
size for pumping systems will be one-inch (1") diameter cast iron or
polyvinyl chloride pipe or an equivalent orifice. Exceptions may be
made to this requirement on a case by case basis only in the event
of a problem with pipe slope, or if the discharge is into a Utility
sewer twelve-inches (12") in diameter or greater.
(3) Connection to the Utility system must be preceded by an
acceptable screening device.
(4) The discharge pipe line must include a double check valve, to
insure against backup from the Utility system into the pool.

§ 219-8. Inspection and Testing of Installed Facility.
(5) Each application must be accompanied by a sketch showing the
exact location of the desired connection, and the pipe line, valves,
appurtenances, and pool structure. Any change from the plan must
be noted on the as-built sketch.
(6) Connection to the Utility sewer must conform to standard Utility
details, including a curb riser, approved saddle, and a proper
lateral connection. Pavement, curb, and sidewalk restoration, if
any, must meet Township requirements.
(7) Notice must be given to the Utility upon each instance in which a
portion or all of the pool water is to be discharged into the Utility
system.
(8) The Superintendent reserves the right to order the disconnection
of pool drains from the sewer system for repeated violations of
these Rules and Regulations.
(9) The Utility will require proper insurance and indemnification
before work is undertaken in the public right-of-way.
A. Tampering with system. No person(s) shall maliciously, willfully, or
negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any
structure, appurtenance or equipment which is part of the East
Brunswick Sewer Utility wastewater facilities. No person shall enter
upon any property of the East Brunswick Sewer Utility without the
express permission of the Utility.
Any such person(s) shall be responsible to pay 100% for all damages
caused by his (their) malicious, willful or negligent acts, and shall also
be subject to the fines and penalties set forth in Section 1-15 of the
Code.
A. Inspection of sewage system during construction. All construction of
sewage systems shall be under the jurisdiction of the Utility, either
directly or through inspectors under the supervision of the Township
Engineer.
(1) The Superintendent and the Applicant's Engineer shall enforce
compliance with the approved plans and specifications.
(2) The Superintendent shall have the authority to have the work
discontinued in the event of noncompliance.
(3) The Applicant shall furnish the name of the occupant, the street
address, and lot and block number to the Utility at least two (2)
weeks prior to a request for the certificate of occupancy from the
§ 219-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-8
1:839
Construction Code Official to assure that the lateral inspection has
been accomplished, and all fees have been paid.
(4) No sewer connections shall be made to the appropriate street main
whether tested or not unless under the supervision and inspection
of the representative for the Superintendent.
A temporary, leak proof bulkhead type plug shall be installed in
the upstream (inlet) side of the manhole furthest downstream in
any sewer main or branch under construction and shall remain
intact and unloosened until permission is received from the
Superintendent to remove same. This permission will not be
granted until each section of the sewer has been cleaned and
flushed in a manner acceptable to the Utility.
B. Testing of completed system. All sewer mains shall be subjected to
either an infiltration or exfiltration test, or under special circumstances
to a low pressure air test. Exfiltration tests shall be conducted in lieu of
infiltration tests when the pipe has been laid above the groundwater
level. Infiltration tests shall be used only when the groundwater level is
above the crown of the sewer and completely surrounds the pipe during
the period of testing. The tests shall be performed between two
manholes or as otherwise directed by the Superintendent for the Utility
and shall include all related sewerage including house connections.
The contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, and equipment
necessary for the testing.
Exfiltration tests shall be under at least a four (4) foot head or a
pressure corresponding to a head equal to the depth of the lower
manhole of the section under the test.
Allowable infiltration of exfiltration shall not exceed a rate of 100
gallons per mile, per inch of diameter of sewer, per 24 hours.
In order to ensure that there shall be no gushing or spurting streams
entering the sewer, the contractor shall be held responsible for water
tightness of the line, shall satisfactorily repair all joints and other
parts not sufficiently water tight and then shall make additional tests
of the infiltration or exfiltration until the test results conform to the
requirements given herein and until all visible leaks are eliminated.
Detailed criteria for testing, and special requirements will be in the
Utility's approval.
Sewer Pipe Cleaning - After testing and before final acceptance of the
work, the Contractor shall clean the entire sewer system, unless such
procedures are specifically waived by the Superintendent. The cleaning
method employed shall utilize Jet-Vac Sewer Cleaner or approved
equal, and all material collected at the downstream end of the system
shall be removed by vacuuming, and shall not pass downstream.
§ 219-8 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-8
1:840
§ 219-9. Billings, Payments, Delinquencies, Etc.
Upon completion and visual acceptance, all lines are to be internally
examined using a television camera, to check for improper joints, offgrade
pipe, and damaged pipe. The inspection is to be witnessed on a
monitor screen by Utility personnel, and video tape is to furnished, as
approved.
A. Rendering of bills for sewer service. All such items are covered by the
Revenue Office in the Finance Department. Bills are mailed at various
times depending on type of user. Sewer service charges for each new
unit will be initiated upon issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or
Temporary Certificate of Occupancy.
Estimated bills will be issued in the event that a meter reading is
not available for a meter read customer. The estimated bill shall be
prepared utilizing the last meter reading indicating usage for that
particular time frame.
B. Delinquent and disputed accounts. Any bill unpaid thirty (30) days after
the due date shall be classified as delinquent and shall be charged at
the maximum statutory interest rate per month. Any bill unpaid fortyfive
(45) days after presentation shall be subject to discontinuance of
service after not less than ten (10) days written notice.
If service is discontinued for non-payment of the account, it will not be
restored until the turn on fee (payable in cash or certified check) plus
all unpaid charges are paid or satisfactory arrangements have been
made for payment.
If the check used for payment is returned by the bank for any reason, a
processing fee will be charged against the account.
Any unpaid balance of service charges and interest thereon shall be a
lien against the property and action shall be initiated pursuant to the
procedure specified under N.J.S.A. 40:14A, N.J.S.A. 26A-12 and N.J.S.A.
54:5-1 et seq.
Notice of delinquent charges shall be processed by the Tax Collector of
East Brunswick.
C. Discontinuance of service. Service may, at the sole discretion of the
Utility, be discontinued for any of the following reasons:
(1) Misrepresentation in application.
(2) Willful waste of water through improper or imperfect pipes,
fixtures, or otherwise.
(3) Use of sewer for any other property or purpose than that described
in the application.
§ 219-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-9
1:841
(4) Tampering with any service pipe, or any other appliance of the
Utility.
(5) Nonpayment of any charge accruing under the application.
(6) Refusal of reasonable access to the property for purposes of
inspecting, reading, repairing, or removing meters and/or
plumbing.
(7) Making, or refusing to sever any cross connection between a pipe
or fixture furnished by the Utility and a pipe or fixture from any
other source.
(8) Nonpayment of bills within time prescribed.
(9) Violation of any rules of the Utility.
D. Renewal of service. Service will be renewed when the conditions under
which such service was disconnected are corrected and upon payment
of all accrued charges provided in the schedule of rates or rules of the
Utility.
E. Deposits. Deposits may be required from new customers without a
record of prior use, or from any customer who becomes habitually
delinquent. The amount of the deposit shall be equal to the average or
estimated bill.
Any customer having paid a deposit shall pay bills for sewer service as
rendered, in accordance with the Rates, Rules and Regulations of the
Utility. The deposit shall not be considered as payment on account of a
bill during the time the customer is receiving service.
Deposits shall be returned to the depositor when he shall have paid
undisputed bills for service for a period of twelve (12) consecutive
months.
No interest will be paid on deposits.
F. Continuing obligation to pay service charge. Upon the connection to a
sewer for an improved and usable property, the obligation to pay the
minimal annual service charge continues despite the failure to occupy
the property or to use the sewer facilities, so long as the building or
structure on the property is still available for use and the sewer
facilities remain available.
Without written notice, it shall be assumed that connections are or
may be active, thereby requiring sewer service. Charges will therefore
continue until written notice of discontinuance.
G. Form of payment. Form of payment may be by check or U.S. currency.
The Utility reserves the right to refuse payment rendered in significant
amounts of coin. For any property on tax title lien, or any account where
§ 219-9 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-9
1:842
§ 219-10. Responsibility for Service.
§ 219-11. Fees and Charges. [Amended 6-11-18 by Ord. No. 18-08]
a check was returned by the bank, payment must be in certified check,
money order, or U.S. currency.
H. Disconnection of sewerage facilities. In the event that a sewer lateral
service will be permanently discontinued, the Utility shall be notified in
writing that the service billing will be terminated. The property owner
must file a letter for disconnection of sewerage facilities, and the sewer
lateral shall be permanently sealed water tight by the property owner in
a manner subject to the approval of the Inspector, with all costs of
review and field observation being borne by the property owner.
A. Reasonable access. The properly identified authorized agents of the
Utility shall have the right of access to the premises served, at all
reasonable hours, for the purpose of reading meters, collecting
samples, examining fixtures and pipes, observing the manner of use,
and for any other purpose which is proper and necessary in the conduct
of the Utility's business.
B. No oral agreements. No agent or employee of the Utility has
authorization to orally bind it by any promise, agreement, or
representation not provided for in these Rates, Rules and Regulations.
C. Damage and repairs. Whenever any person(s), firm(s), partnership(s),
corporation(s), or any combination thereof causes or has caused any
damage to the sewer system or facilities of the Utility, the party or
parties causing such damage shall immediately notify the Utility of such
damage. The Utility shall have the right to repair such damage or have
such damage repaired, and shall have the further right to recover the
full cost and expense of such repairs, including but not limited to the
standard charges for work performed by Utility employees, for
materials, supplies and equipment used for such repairs, from the party
or parties causing such damage.
D. Mandatory sewer connection. The owner of any house, building or
structure located on a street along the line of any sewer which is now in
operation or is constructed in the future in the Township of East
Brunswick shall connect the drainage of all sources of sewage in the
house, building or structure to the sewer. Any owner of a building or
structure who fails to connect to a sewer system after written
notification by the Utility of the availability of service, shall be subject
to the penalties and remedies of the East Brunswick Township
Ordinance.
A. Fees and deposit to accompany application and permits. For standard
applications, see table below for fees. Minimum deposits may be
increased if the Utility review exceed these minimum requirements.

B. Sewer services charges.
All owners of property connected to the sewer system of the East
Brunswick Sewer Utility shall pay to the Utility a base sewer service
charge in accordance with the following schedule:
The sewer service charge shall be at the annual rate of $320.00 for each
Service Unit.
The classification of establishments connected to the sewer system and
the Service Units chargeable to each such establishment shall be as
follows:
(1) Residential Establishments:
(a) Each single family residence - One service unit.
(b) House trailer shall be one service unit.
(c) Each apartment in a multi-family dwelling, apartment house,
commercial or other building, shall be one service unit.
(2) For all other buildings or establishments, including commercial
establishments, industrial establishments (with only domestic
sewage), schools and public buildings, the charge shall be the
greater of:
(a) 0.1 service units per 10,000 gallons of sewage flow or part
thereof; or
§ 219-11 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-11
1:846
(b) The number of service units as specified for the particular
classification in § 219-11(K) hereof, multiplied by the annual
rate set forth herein.
The volume of sewage flow on which the determination of the
unit charges applicable under (a) above are based shall, except
as otherwise provided for herein, be assumed to be the same
as the quarterly volume of water use as determined by the
East Brunswick Water Utility. Volume of water use does not
apply and shall have no impact on rates charges by service unit
classification under (b).
(3) Water used but not discharged into sanitary sewers by Commercial
and Industrial Establishments.
Whenever any commercial or industrial establishment uses water
in such manner that water used is not discharged into the sanitary
sewer system of the East Brunswick Sewer Utility, the quantity
of water so used and not discharged into the sanitary sewerage
system shall be excluded in determining the sewer charges for said
premises; providing, however, that the quantity of water so used
and not discharged into the sewerage system is measured by a
device or meter approved by the Superintendent and installed by
the owner of the premises without cost to the Utility. In lieu of
the installation of a device or meter for measuring the quantity of
water not discharged into the Utility's sanitary sewerage system,
the owner of the premises may install, at his own cost and expense,
a device or meter for measuring the quantity of sewage discharged
into the Utility's sanitary sewer system.
When, in the opinion of the Superintendent, it is not practical to
install a measuring device to continuously determine the quantity
of water discharged into or not discharged into the sanitary
sewerage system, the Utility shall determine, in such manner or by
such method as it may prescribe, the quantity of water discharged
into the sanitary sewerage system, either as a percentage of the
total volume of metered water use or otherwise. Any dispute as to
the estimated amount shall be determined by the Utility and its
decision shall be final. If the owner of the property is not willing
to accept the determination of the Utility he may be required, for
the purpose of determining future sewer rental charge, to install an
approved measuring device as described in the paragraph above.
(4) Sewer Charges to Commercial or Industrial Establishment without
separate water meters
Whenever two or more establishments are served by a single water
meter the Utility may estimate the amount of water delivered to
each establishment and may apply full or minimum charges to each
establishment as enumerated above.
§ 219-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-11
1:847
If the owner of the property does not agree to the Utility's
determination of the sewer charge as set forth above, they shall,
at their sole cost and expense, install separate meters for each
building or establishment on the premises.
(5) Floor Drain Charges.
(a) Floor Drains - 0.30 service units per 1,000 sq. ft. (or part) of
building are tributary to floor drains.
(b) Vehicle Bays - Additional 0.33 service units per bay where
occasional car washing may be expected.
Additional 0.66 service units per bay where occasional truck
washing (exterior or interior) may be expected.
(6) Swimming Pool Drains.
(a) For swimming pool sizes as follows:
[1] 10,000 - 20,000 gallons, additional .20 service units
[2] 20,000 - 40,000 gallons, additional .80 service units
[3] Over 40,000 gallons, additional .20 service units per
10,000 gallons or part thereof
C. Connection charges.
A connection charge or charges shall be imposed for each direct or
indirect connection to the East Brunswick Sewer System. The charges
shall be as per this Rate Schedule for each Service Unit as defined in
§ 219-11(L) under Initial Connection Charge, except where otherwise
noted.
Initial charges for the right to connect directly or indirectly to the
Utility's sewer system shall include a connection fee per unit, as unit is
herein defined under "Initial connection Charge", as well as additions
to fees and charges for inspections of the work to be accomplished
by applicants in keeping with the Utility's Rules and Regulations as
the same are promulgated, amended, modified and supplemented from
time to time. Such Connection Fees, which are and constitute a onetime
initial charge for the right to connect to the Utility's sewer system,
are an integral part of the Utility's Rate Schedule and are a distinct and
separate charge from all other rates and sewer charges and payment of
one shall not constitute payment of the other.
Connection Charge - The connection charge shall be a fee charged
to any customer of the East Brunswick Sewer Utility at the time of
connection of the facility or facilities of said customer either directly or
indirectly to any portion of the East Brunswick Sewer Utility system,
or at the time when sewer service becomes available, calculated on the

basis of capital costs expended by the Utility to the date of calculation
together with accrued interest thereon.
The connection charge shall be updated from time to time by the
East Brunswick Sewer Utility to reflect additional capital costs and
additional interest accrued on the East Brunswick Sewer Utility sewer
system.
The current connection charge is $2,395.00 per Service Unit.
Upon an addition, alteration or change in use of any building already
connected to the Utility system, an additional connection fee may be
charged based upon the sewer connection designations.
D. Waste surcharges.
Where biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solid sample results
indicate that strengths exceed those of a domestically equivalent waste
of greater than 225 mg/l, and if such wastes have been introduced
into the Utility sanitary sewer system, excess loading charges will be
imposed as follows:
Waste volumes shall be based on a metered flow, corroborated (when
requested) by water meter records. Charges for volume shall be as
shown in the rate schedule.
The customer shall pay all excess loading charges from the Utility
within 20 days of receipt of such billing. The failure to pay such excess
loading charges within the twenty-day period will result in an automatic
cancellation of the customer's participation in the average excess
loading program.
Waste strength shall not exceed the limits listed in the section entitled
Industrial or Commercial Service without pre-treatment.
(1) Excess loading charges for suspended solids, biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), chlorine demand, and other materials shall be
based on actual charges to the Utility by the MCUA. Quarterly
samples shall be taken for suspended solids and BOD to establish
the concentrations in determining the annual excess loading rate.
The annual excess loading rate will be calculated by averaging the
total suspended solids and BOD results for the prior year
proportionately against the tolerance parameter of 400 mg/l. This
annual loading rate shall be set prior to the billing year and be
recalculated the following year. The excess loading rate shall be
multiplied by the metered water flow per 1,000 gallons of usage to
establish the excess loading charge.
(2) Customers may request, at their expense, an additional sample for
anomalous results. The customer shall not determine the date of
the additional test. The results of the additional sample shall be
integrated into the calculation of the excess loading rate and not
§ 219-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-11
1:849
replace the anomalous sample. The requested additional sample
charge shall be added to the customer's sewer bill at the cost to the
Township to perform the sample.
(3) Establishments that have no sample history shall be assessed at a
domestically equivalent waste assumed sample result of 225 mg/l
until a loading rate can be reasonably calculated.
(4) Quarterly samples shall be taken to determine the discharge
concentration for grease, oil, fats, either vegetable or mineral.
Results in excess of the allowable limit of 100 mg/l shall be charged
a flat charge for the quarter of $250.00.
The Collector of Revenue shall have the discretion to make any
modifications necessary to insure that the intent of the excess
loading charges as approved by the EBSU is adhered to.
E. Payments of connection fee. For single family home, existing prior to
the installation of collection lines by the Utility, and applying and
connecting within thirty (30) days after notification of availability of
services by the Utility, payment must be:
(1) In lump sum, or
(2) In three (3) equal installments over a three year period,
commencing at time of availability of service, prior to connection.
(Balance to be paid in full upon change in ownership)
Single family home built after collection lines were installed,
payment must be:
In lump sum prior to connection or occupancy.
Property owners who fail to make application and connection
within the required time limits, and do not have written
certification from the Township of East Brunswick indicating valid
reasons for not connecting:
Payments due in full on date service becomes available. Service is
considered available upon notification by the Utility, which is not
necessarily the time of connection.
For developments comprising two (2) or more homes,
payment must be made:
Prior to submission of Application for Acceptance; or
Phased in accordance with construction phases if so approved by
the Utility.
Where multi-family or non-residential structures exist prior
to the installation of the collection system, payment must be
made:
§ 219-11 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 219-11
1:850
In full within thirty (30) days after the notification that service is
available.
Prior to the connection if the connection is made within the thirty
(30) day limit.
When multi-family or non-residential structures are built
after the collection system is available for service, payment
must be made:
At the time of the application, which must be prior to the
connection and occupancy.
A change in use shall require the submission of Change of Use
form, and may require the payment of an additional connection
fee, if the connection fee for the resulting use is higher than the
connection fee for the prior use at the time of change in use. The
amount of the connection fee will be the connection fee for the
resulting use, less the connection fee paid for the prior use of the
property.
F. Liens; rights and remedies; enforcement. In the event that an initial
service charge or connection fee or annual service charge with regard
to any parcel of real property owned by any person, corporation, or

commercial facilities and services; to ensure compatibility among
various land uses; to conserve the value of the land; to encourage more
efficient use of land and of public services; to encourage better
transportation of people; to prevent strip commercial development; and

which may be constructed by the developer during any year may be
regulated by the Planning Board at a rate which would not create
excessive demands on any municipal facility or services available to
serve the area proposed for development. Such development as may be
allowed pursuant hereto shall be controlled by means of the issuance of
building permits at an annual rate fixed by the Planning Board at the
time of preliminary approval, based upon the projected development.

§ 228-217.12 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 228-217.12
1:1082
G. Conclusions and granting or denial of plan. The granting or denial of
preliminary approval shall be by written resolution, including but not
limited to findings of fact and conclusions which may set forth in what
respects the plan would or would not be in the public interest; in what
respect the plan is or is not consistent with the statement of objectives
of a mixed use development; the purpose, location and amount of the
common open space in the mixed use development; the reliability of the
proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common open
space; the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the
common open space, as related to the proposed density and type of
development; the physical design of the plan and manner in which the
design does or does not make adequate provision for public services,
provide adequate control over vehicular traffic and further amenities of
light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment; and the relationship,
beneficial or adverse, of the proposed mixed use development to the
neighborhood in which it is proposed.
H. Implementation in sections or stages. As a condition to preliminary
approval of the mixed use development plan, the Planning Board may
require or permit the implementation of the plan in whole or in sections
or stages under the sequence of actions determined as part of the
Mixed Use Development District plan. Such sections or stages shall be
substantially functionally self contained and self sustaining with regard
to access, parking, utilities, open spaces and similar physical features
and shall be capable of substantial occupancy, operation and
maintenance upon completion of the construction and development;
shall be properly related to other services of the community as a whole
and to those facilities and services yet to be provided in the full
execution and implementation of the mixed use development district;
and shall be provided with such temporary or permanent transitional
features, buffers or protective areas as the Planning Board may require
under conditions of ownership and maintenance and as will prevent
damage or detriment to any completed section or stage to other
sections or stages and to adjoining properties not in the mixed use
development plan. Plans and specifications of such sections or stages
are to be filed with the Planning Board and are to be of sufficient detail
and at such a scale as to fully demonstrate the following:
(1) Arrangement and site locations of all structures, primary and
accessory land uses, parking, landscaping, public and private
utilities and service facilities and land ownership conditions.
(2) Estimates of the economic base of the section or stage and its one
or more sections or stages as supported by such evidence as the
estimated cost and market values of structures and land
improvement; increase of taxable values; cost of maintenance and
services to be borne by public and private agencies; potential
rental scales; and cost of utility installations.
(3) Estimates of its social characteristics, such as the size and
composition of future population in terms of probable family size as
§ 228-217.12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-217.12
1:1083
occupants of the several unit dwelling types; the need for public
services and protection, for recreational facilities and for
commercial and professional services; and anticipated rental
scales.
(4) Such further evidence as shall demonstrate conformity to and
support of principles and objectives of the Township Master Plan
and the enhancement of the living standards of the community with
conformity to the balance of residential, commercial and public
land utilization and the economic base, as established in the mixed
use development district plans.
I. Issuance of permits. Upon finding that the plans and specifications for
the proposed development of the section or stage conform to the above
conditions, the Planning Board shall so inform the administrative
officers as are charged with the issuance of permits for the construction
of utilities or structures that, upon presentation of requisite working
drawings and specifications, covenants, performance bonds and other
required guaranties and instruments, such permits may be issued.
Upon substantial completion of any section or stage, and before
proceeding with the review and approval of additional sections or
stages, the Planning Board may require a report and review of the
status, character and conditions of it and other previously completed
sections or stages with regard to their compliance with the plans,
specifications and estimates which formed the basis for their approval.
Upon finding that such compliance has occurred, the applicant shall
initiate proceedings for the review of the new section or stage.
J. Modifications or adjustments. As a further condition for approval of
later sections or stages, the Board may require or permit adjustments
or modifications in the conditions established in the approved Mixed
Use Development District plan to compensate for differences between
the estimates of record on previously approved and completed sections
or stages, as required under Subsection H above, and the actual
conditions prevailing on their completion. In this regard, consideration
may be given to the balance of land uses established, consistency with
the conditions of the Mixed Use Development District plan, extent of
variance from the social and economic estimates on which previous
approval may have been based, overall maximum and minimum
requirements established elsewhere in this chapter and the effects of
unforeseen changes, extreme conditions or unexpected advantages
which may have resulted during the time of construction and
development. On determining that such adjustments or modifications
are reasonable, the Planning Board shall follow in full the procedure
and conditions herein required for original submittal and review.
K. Application for final approval. Application for final approval may be for
all the land included in a plan or, to the extent set forth in the
preliminary approval, for a section thereof. The application shall
include such drawings, specifications, covenants, easements,
conditions and form of performance bond as set forth by written
§ 228-217.12 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 228-217.12
1:1084
resolution of the municipal authority at the time of preliminary
approval. A public hearing on an application for final approval of the
plan, or part thereof, shall not be required, provided that the plan,
or part thereof, submitted for final approval is in compliance with
the plan theretofore given preliminary approval. A plan submitted for
final approval shall be deemed to be in compliance with the plan
previously given preliminary approval, provided that any modification
by the landowner of the plan as preliminarily approved does not vary
the proposed net residential density or intensity of use by more than
five percent (5%), while still remaining within the number of units
permitted under the maximum gross density; does not substantially
relocate the common open space area; does not increase by more than
ten percent (10%) the floor area proposed for nonresidential use; does
not increase by more than five percent (5%) the total ground areas
covered by buildings; nor involve a substantial change in the height of
buildings. A public hearing shall not be held to consider modifications
in the location and design of streets or facilities for water and for
disposal of storm water and sanitary sewage. A public hearing shall not
be held on an application for final approval of a plan when the plan, as
submitted for final approval, is in substantial compliance with the plan
as approval, is in substantial compliance with the plan as preliminarily
approved. The burden shall, nevertheless, be on the landowner to show
the Planning Board good cause for any variation between the plan as
preliminarily approved and the plan as submitted for final approval. The
Planning Board may permit the minimal deviations referred to above
with regard to conditions of preliminary approval only if the applicant
satisfies the Planning Board that such deviations were necessitated by
a change of conditions beyond the control of the applicant since the
date of preliminary approval. If such demonstration cannot be made by
the applicant, he shall be required to submit another application for
preliminary approval.
L. Final approval. Final approval shall be granted or denied within fortyfive
(45) days after submission of a complete application to the
administrative officer or within such further time as may be consented
to be the applicant. Failure of the Planning Board to act within the
period prescribed shall constitute final approval in accordance with
N.J.R.S. 40:55D 50b.
M. Validity of final approval. A plan, or any part thereof, which has been
given final approval by the Planning Board shall be so certified without
delay by the Planning Board Chairman or Vice Chairman and shall be
filed of record forthwith in the office of the County Clerk by the
developer before any development shall take place in accordance
therewith. Pending completion within five (5) years of the planned unit
residential development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that
has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of the plan
or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made nor shall it be
impaired, except with the consent of the landowner and the Planning
Board.
§ 228-217.12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-217.12
1:1085
N. Petition for review. Following approval of development plans, the
issuance of permits and substantial progress in the completion of
twenty-five (25) of the controlled density units thereof, measured as a
percentage of the acreage of anticipated population, whichever shall be
the greater, the developer may petition for review in detail of the
previously approved plans or units awaiting development or
completion, stating his reasons therefor. Reasons may be based on such
considerations as changing social or economic conditions, potential
improvements in layout or design features, unforeseen difficulties or
advantage mutually affecting the interests of the Township and the
developer, such as technical causes, site conditions, state or federal
projects and installations and statutory revisions. The Planning Board,
on finding such reasons and petitions to be reasonable and valid, may
consider the redesign, in whole or in part, of any Mixed Use
Development District and shall follow in full the procedure and
conditions herein required for original submittal and review.

3. No residential lot lines shall encroach upon any area where Leq is
65 dBA or greater.
4. Except as provided in Subsection D, no land shall be designated or
approved for construction or use as a public or private exterior
recreational area, including, but not limited to, playgrounds,
outdoor theaters and amphitheaters, picnic grounds, tennis courts,
and swimming pools, if the exterior sound level from external
sources anywhere on the site of the proposed recreational area is
projected to be in excess of 65dBA Leq now, or as the result of
proposed construction or development on the site. Appropriate
means of sound attenuation, such as berms, barriers, or buildings,
at the perimeter of, or elsewhere on the site, may be utilized to
achieve the required sound level. Such methods of sound
attenuations must be specifically approved by the reviewing body.
In reviewing such methods, the reviewing body shall consider
environment, aesthetics, quality of life, engineering standards,
maintenance problems and maintenance costs.
D. Upon completion of the necessary remedial work, a revised sound level
report as indicated in Subsection A shall be submitted. Once the sound
levels have been reduced to the acceptable standards set forth in
Subsection A, development approval may be issued.
This section shall not prohibit the designation or approval of any green
belt or open space in any area in which the sound level exceed 65
dBA Leq regardless of whether such green belt or open space is open
to public use, provided that no recreational improvement or facility is
constructed thereon.
E. As a condition of approval, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall require the submission of future certified reports prior
to the issuance of certificates of occupancy to verify that the condition
in Subsection 5b has been met. These reports shall contain, at a
minimum, twenty-four (24) hours of sound testing in the bedroom to
determine that the Leq is below the levels established in Subsection 5b,

1:1123
§ 228-229.3. Steep Slopes. [Added 59-11 by Ord. No. 11-08]
except that the permissible interior night levels shall be reduced an
additional 10 decibels.
F. Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy and the transfer of the
property by deed, the property owner of record shall become
responsible for the maintenance of all sound attenuation devices on
that property.
The developer shall attach to all contracts of sale a map which
designates all areas within the development where noise levels exceed
65 dBA Leq. The lot subject to sale shall be clearly delineated. Such
map shall be approved by the Township Engineer.
G. For the purposes of this section, all measurements and designations of
sound levels shall be expressed a percentile of Leq sound pressure
levels unless the Township specifically approves an alternate.
All measurements to determine if sound is within the levels set forth
herein shall be carried out utilizing a sound level meter which meets
the specifications established by ANSI.
A. Purpose. To regulate the intensity of use in areas of steeply sloping
terrain in order to limit soil loss, erosion, excessive stormwater runoff,
the degradation of surface water and to maintain the natural
topography and drainage patterns of land. The requirements set forth
in this Ordinance are consistent with those found in the State of New
Jersey's Water Quality Management Planning rule (N.J.A.C. 7:15).
B. Background. Disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion
processes from stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of
waterbodies with the associated degradation of water quality and loss
of aquatic life support. Related effects include soil loss, changes in
natural topography and drainage patterns, increased flooding potential,
further fragmentation of forest and habitat areas, and compromised
aesthetic values. It has become widely recognized that disturbance of
steep slopes should be restricted or prevented based on the impact
disturbance of steep slopes can have on water quality and quantity, and
the environmental integrity of landscapes.
C. Applicability. This ordinance shall be applicable to new development or
land disturbance on a steep slope within East Brunswick Township.
D. Definitions Applicable to Steep Slope Ordinance:
DISTURBANCE  The placement of impervious surface, the exposure
or movement of soil or bedrock, or the clearing, cutting, or removing of
vegetation.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  Any structure, surface, or improvement that
reduces or prevents absorption of stormwater into land, and includes
porous paving, paver blocks, gravel, crushed stone, decks, patios,
§ 228-229.2 EAST BRUNSWICK CODE § 228-229.3
1:1124
elevated structures, and other similar structures, surfaces, or
improvements.
REDEVELOPMENT  The construction of structures or improvements
on areas which previously contained structures or other improvements.
STEEP SLOPES  Any slope equal to or greater than 20 percent
as measured over any minimum run of 10 feet. Steep slopes are
determined based on contour intervals of two feet or less.
E. Designation of Areas. The percent of slope (rise in feet per horizontal
distance) shall be established by measurement of distance
perpendicular to the contour of the slope. The percent of slope shall be
calculated for each two foot contour interval. For example, any location
on the site where there is a one foot rise over a 10 foot horizontal run
constitutes a 10 percent slope; a 1.5 foot rise over a 10 foot horizontal
run constitutes a 15 percent slope; a two foot rise over a 10 foot
horizontal run constitutes a 20 percent slope.
F. Steep Slope Limits for steep slopes any disturbance shall be prohibited
except as provided below:
1. Redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces;
and
2. New disturbance necessary to protect public health, safety or
welfare, such as necessary linear development with no feasible
alternative; to provide an environmental benefit, such as
remediation of a contaminated site; to prevent extraordinary
hardship on the property owner peculiar to the property; or to
prevent extraordinary hardship, provided the hardship was not
created by the property owner, that would not permit a minimum
economically viable use of the property based upon reasonable
investment. For example, redevelopment, within the footprint of
existing impervious cover should be allowed to support efforts to
revitalize development that has fallen into disrepair.
The applicant shall demonstrate through site plans depicting
proposed development and topography that new disturbance is not
located in areas with a 20 percent or greater slope.
G. Conflicts and Severability.
1. Conflicts: All other ordinances, parts of ordinances, or other local
requirements that are inconsistent or in conflict with this ordinance
are hereby superseded to the extent of any inconsistency or
conflict, and the provisions of this ordinance apply.
2. Severability:
a. This section shall be so construed as not to conflict with any
provision of New Jersey or federal law.

§ 228-229.4. Prohibited uses. [Added 2-10-2020 by Ord. No. 20-04]
The following are prohibited in all zones within the Township of East
Brunswick:
b. Notwithstanding that any provision of this section is held to be
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
all remaining provisions of the section shall continue to be of
full force and effect.
c. The provisions of this section shall be cumulative with, and not
in substitution for, all other applicable zoning, planning and
land use regulations.
H. Enforcement, violation and penalties
A prompt investigation shall be made, by the appropriate personnel
of East Brunswick Township, of any person or entity believed to be in
violation hereof. If, upon inspection, a condition which is in violation
of this section is discovered, a civil action in the Special Civil Part
of the Superior Court, or in the Superior Court, if the primary relief
sought is injunctive or if penalties may exceed the jurisdictional limit of
the Special Civil Part, by the filing and serving of appropriate process.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the right of East
Brunswick Township, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 26:3A2-25, to initiate legal
proceedings hereunder in Municipal Court. The violation of any section
or subsection of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct
offense independent of the violation of any other section or subsection,
or of any order issued pursuant to this section. Each day a violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense.
Violations and penalties enumerated in § 228-265 shall be applicable to
the enforcement of this section.

ARTICLE XXVII
Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance Statutory Authorization,
Findings of Fact Purpose and Objectives
[Amended 12-14-81 by Ord. No. 81-422; 4-15-87 by Ord. No. 87-829;
4-24-89 by Ord. No. 89-12; 5-2-10 by Ord. No. 10-13]
§ 228-230. Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.
1.1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1
et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Township Council of East
Brunswick, New Jersey, Middlesex County does ordain as follows.
1.2. FINDINGS OF FACT.
1. The flood hazard areas of East Brunswick are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood
heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause
damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed,
elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute
to the flood loss.
1.3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
1. To protect human life and health;
2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruption;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges, located in areas of special flood hazard;
§ 228-230 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-230
1:1127

of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
7. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
8. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
1.4. METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and
provisions for:
1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which
result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
3. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or
channel floodwaters;
4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and
5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood
hazards in other areas.

§ 228-234. Provisions for flood hazard reduction. [Amended 5-24-10
by Ord. No. 10-13]
6. The Manager of Engineering Services shall maintain the records of
all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any
variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
4.4-2. Conditions for Variances.
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
a-k in Section 4.4 1(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. a showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
c. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Section 4.4-1(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
6. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
5.1. GENERAL STANDARDS.
§ 228-233 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-234
1:1137
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are

of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement
and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A
minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,

5.5-2. SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data
have been provided as set forth in Section 3.2, BASIS FOR
ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD or in
Section 4.3-2, Use of Other Base Flood Data, the following standards
are required:
5.2-1. Residential Construction.
A. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement together
with the attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, elevated to or
above base flood elevation

number specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified). And, require adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
5.2-2. Nonresidential Construction.
In an Area of Special Flood Hazard, all new construction and
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other
nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement
together with the attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, shall
§ 228-234 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-234
1:1139
1. Be elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; and
2. Within any AO zone on the municipality's DFIRM that all new
construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet (at least
two feet if no depth number is specified). And require adequate
drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters
around and away from proposed structures; or
3. be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
4. have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

ARTICLE XXXVI
Riparian Zone Regulations
[Added 4-20-09 by Ord. No. 09-10]
§ 228-294. Intent and purpose.
The governing body of East Brunswick Township finds that riparian lands
adjacent to streams, lakes, or other surface water bodies that are
adequately vegetated provide an important environmental protection and
water resource management benefit. It is necessary to protect and maintain
the beneficial character of riparian areas by implementing specifications
for the establishment, protection, and maintenance of vegetation along the
surface water bodies within East Brunswick Township, consistent with the
interest of landowners in making reasonable economic use of parcels of land
that include such designated areas.
The specific purposes and intent of this Ordinance are to:
A. Restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of
the Township's water resources;
B. Prevent excessive nutrients, sediment, and organic matter, as well as
biocides and other pollutants, from reaching surface waters by
optimizing opportunities for filtration, deposition, absorption,
adsorption, plant uptake, biodegradation, and denitrification, which
occur when stormwater runoff is conveyed through vegetated buffers as
stable, distributed flow prior to reaching receiving waters;
C. Provide for shading of the aquatic environment so as to moderate
temperatures, retain more dissolved oxygen, and support a healthy
assemblage of aquatic flora and fauna;
D. Provide for the availability of natural organic matter (leaves and twigs)
and large woody debris (trees and limbs) that provide food and habitat
for aquatic organisms (insects, amphibians, crustaceans, and small
fish), which are essential to maintain the food chain;
E. Increase stream bank stability and maintain natural fluvial
geomorphology of the stream system, thereby reducing stream bank
erosion and sedimentation and protecting habitat for aquatic
organisms;
F. Maintain base flows in streams and moisture in wetlands;
G. Control downstream flooding; and
H. Conserve the natural features important to land and water resources,
e.g., headwater areas, ground water recharge zones, floodways,
floodplains, springs, streams, wetlands, woodlands, and prime wildlife
habitats.
§ 228-294 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-295
1:1243
§ 228-295. Statutory authority.
East Brunswick Township is empowered to regulate land uses under the
provisions of the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1
et seq., which authorizes each municipality to plan and regulate land use
in order to protect public health, safety and welfare by protecting and
maintaining native vegetation in riparian areas. The Township is also
empowered to adopt and implement this Ordinance under provisions
provided by the following legislative authorities of the State of New Jersey:
Water Pollution Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10A 1 et seq.
Water Quality Planning Act, N.J.S.A. 58:11A 1 et seq.

as follows:
ACID PRODUCING SOILS  Soils that contain geologic deposits of iron
sulfide materials (pyrite and marcasite) which, when exposed to oxygen
from the air or from surface waters, oxidize to produce sulfuric acid. Acid
producing soils, upon excavation, generally have a pH of 4.0 or lower. After
exposure to oxygen, these soils generally have a pH of 3.0 or lower.
APPLICANT  A person, corporation, government body or other legal entity
applying to the Planning Board, Board of Adjustment or the Construction
Office proposing to engage in an activity that is regulated by the provisions
of this ordinance, and that would be located in whole or in part within a
regulated Riparian Zone.
FLOODWAY  Shall have the meaning ascribed to this term by the Flood
Hazard Area Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:16A-50 et seq., and regulations
