§ 4-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 4-75
1:77
(b) Urine specimens may be ordered from sworn law enforcement
officers who have been randomly selected to submit a drug
test. Random selection shall be defined as a method of
selection in which each and every sworn member of the law
enforcement agency, regardless of rank or assignment, has an
equal chance to be selected for drug testing each and every
time a selection is conducted.
(c) Urine specimens may be collected from sworn law
enforcement officers during a regularly scheduled and
announced medical examination or a fitness-for-duty
examination. However, the collection and analysis of these
specimens are not governed by this policy.
D. Notification of drug testing procedures.
(1) Applicants. Applicants for positions as law enforcement officers
shall be required to submit urine samples for drug testing. Prior to
the submission of any samples for a drug test, the applicant shall be
required to complete a form which advises the applicant that (s)he
is required to submit a urine specimen as a condition of being
considered for employment. This form shall also advise the
applicant that a negative test result is a condition of employment
and that a positive test result will result in:
(a) The applicant being dropped from consideration for
employment.

mandatory during basic training. Newly appointed officers
shall also be informed that a negative test result is a condition
of employment, and that a positive result would necessitate the
following:
[1] The officer's termination from employment.
§ 4-75 UNION CITY CODE § 4-75
1:78
[2] The officer's name shall be reported to the Central Drug
Registry maintained by the New Jersey Division of State
Police.
[3] The officer being permanently barred from future law
enforcement officer employment in New Jersey.
(b) In addition, newly appointed officers shall be further informed
that the refusal to submit to a drug test shall result in dismissal
from employment and a permanent bar from future law
enforcement employment in New Jersey.
(3) Sworn law enforcement officers. Sworn law enforcement officers
shall be required to submit a urine specimen for drug testing under
either of the following circumstances:
(a) Reasonable suspicion testing.
[1] A sworn law enforcement officer may be ordered to submit
to a drug test when reasonable suspicion exists to believe
that the officer is illegally using drugs. Prior to an officer
submitting to a drug test under such circumstances, a
written report shall be prepared which documents the
basis for the reasonable suspicion. This report shall be
reviewed and approved by the County Prosecutor or the
Chief of Police before a reasonable suspicion test may be
ordered. Under emergent circumstances, approval may be
obtained based upon a verbal report of the facts which
form the basis for reasonable suspicion.
[2] Every sworn law enforcement officer is hereby advised
that negative test result is a condition of employment. A
positive test result shall result in the following actions:
[a] The officer shall be immediately terminated from
employment.
[b] The officer's name shall be reported to the Central
Drug Registry maintained by the New Jersey Division
of State Police.
[c] The officer shall be permanently barred from future
law enforcement officer employment in New Jersey.

based upon reasonable suspicion after being lawfully
ordered to do so is subject to the same penalties as any
officer who tests positive for the illegal use of drugs.
(b) Random drug testing. As referenced earlier in this policy, this
agency shall implement a program which shall provide for the
random testing of its sworn personnel for drugs. Any officer
who submits a sample for random drug testing which results in
§ 4-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 4-75
1:79
a positive result, or any officer who refuses to submit to a
random drug test as ordered by a superior officer shall be
subject to the following actions:

E. Random drug testing policy and procedures.
(1) The frequency of random drug testing shall be determined by the
Chief of Police with notice to the Director of Public Safety and
remains within his/her discretion. Random drug testing shall not be
implemented until these rules and regulations establishing these
procedures have been in effect for a minimum of 60 days.
(2) All sworn members of this agency, regardless of rank or
assignment, shall be eligible for random drug testing.
(3) The number of officers to be tested each time a random selection
takes place shall be no more than 10% of the total number of sworn
officers at the time of selection. [Amended 2-3-2015]
(4) All sworn officers shall be placed in a pool from which a random
selection shall be made. Selections shall be made by use of a
computer based on a random number system which shall ensure
that every officer has an equal statistical chance of being selected.
Officers who are selected for a random drug test are not removed
from the computer database for future selections. Therefore it is
possible for an officer to be selected several times in any given
year. In addition, the computer shall generate an alternate
selection list which shall be utilized in the event that an officer who
has been selected for random sampling is excused from giving a
sample. See Subsection E(10) below, describing those
circumstances which would exempt an officer from submitting a
sample, and which would then require that the corresponding
officer on the alternate selection list be selected to give a sample.
(5) The internal affairs unit shall be responsible for the maintenance of
records pertaining to the selection process and the subsequent
testing of personnel, including all pertinent reports and forms
which may be required.
(6) A representative of each of the collective bargaining units which
represent sworn officers shall be permitted to witness the selection
process. Each representative shall be notified of the time and place
§ 4-75 UNION CITY CODE § 4-75
1:80
for each selection process. The union representatives shall not be
informed of the identity of any officer who has been randomly
selected to submit a urine specimen. Further, the selection process
shall not be delayed due to the unavailability or tardiness of any
union representative.
(7) Any member of this Department who discloses the identity of an
officer selected for random testing, or discloses the fact that a
random test is scheduled to take place prior to the collection of
urine specimens, shall be subject to discipline.
(8) The internal affairs unit shall be responsible for the selection,
notification, collection, monitoring, chain of custody, storage and
transport of urine specimens to the State Toxicology Laboratory
and any subsequent recordkeeping which is necessary to ensure
that the testing process is conducted in a prompt, efficient and
confidential manner.
(9) Officers who have been selected for a drug test based upon random
sampling shall be notified by the internal affairs unit and shall
immediately report to the collection facility at the date and time
specified. An officer who refuses to comply with an order directing
that a urine specimen be given shall be subject to the same
penalties as those officers who test positive for the illegal use of
drugs.
(10) Circumstances may arise in which an officer who has been selected
to submit a sample as part of random procedure may not be
available. The following conditions will require that an officer who
has been selected to submit a sample be excused from giving a
sample for that particular selection only. The next officer shall then
be selected from the alternate selection list and shall be required to
comply with this directive. Conditions allowing the selection of an
alternate are:
(a) An officer who is currently on authorized sick leave for a period
of time at least 24 hours prior to the selection process, and who
remains on sick leave at the time of selection.
(b) An officer who is utilizing previously approved vacation, time
owed, personal day or other compensatory time off such as
bereavement leave, military or maternity leave, approved leave
of absence and other compensatory time off as provided for in
both the PBA and FOP contracts. [Amended 5-21-2013]
F. Specimen acquisition procedures.
(1) Preliminary acquisition procedures.
(a) A member of the internal affairs unit shall serve as the official
monitor of the specimen acquisition process. As needed, staff

1:81
may be supplemented for this purpose at the discretion of the
Chief of Police, on notice to the Director of Public Safety.
(b) The monitor shall always be a member of the same sex as the
individual being tested. If there is no member of the same sex
available from internal affairs to collect a specimen, then the
Department may request that a member of the same sex from
another law enforcement agency serve as the monitor of the
process.
(c) The monitor of the specimen acquisition process shall be
responsible for:
[1] Ensuring that all documentation is fully and accurately
completed by the individual who is submitting the
specimen.
[2] Collecting specimens in a manner that provides for
individual privacy while ensuring the integrity of the
specimen.
[3] Complying with chain of custody procedures established

(d) Prior to the submission of a urine specimen, an applicant for a
law enforcement position shall execute a form consenting to
the collection and analysis of his/her urine for illegal drugs.
This form shall also advise the applicant that a negative test
result is a condition of employment, and that a positive test
result will result in the following actions:
[1] The applicant will be dropped from consideration for
employment.
[2] The applicant's name shall be reported to the Central Drug
Registry maintained by the New Jersey Division of State
Police.
[3] The applicant shall be precluded from being considered
for future law enforcement employment for a period of two
years.
[4] Applicants shall not complete a medical questionnaire
prior to the submission of a specimen unless they have
already received a conditional offer of employment.
[5] Applicants who have not received a conditional offer of
employment can be required to complete a medical
questionnaire if, following the submission of their
specimen to the State Toxicology Laboratory for analysis,
the law enforcement agency receives a report indicating
§ 4-75 UNION CITY CODE § 4-75
1:82
that the specimen tested positive for a controlled
substance.
(e) Prior to the submission of a urine specimen, a trainee enrolled
in a basic training course shall complete a form that advises
the trainee that a negative test result is a condition of
employment, and that a positive test result will result in the
following actions:
[1] The trainee shall be dismissed from basic training.
[2] The trainee shall be dismissed from employment as a law
enforcement officer by the appointing authority.
[3] The trainee's name shall be reported to the Central Drug
Registry maintained by the New Jersey Division of State
Police.
[4] The trainee shall be permanently barred from future law
enforcement employment in New Jersey.
(f) This form shall also advise the trainee that a refusal to
participate in the testing process carries the same penalties as
a specimen which yields a positive result. Trainees shall also
complete a medical questionnaire which clearly describes all
medications, both prescription and over-the-counter
(nonprescription), that were ingested within the past 14 days.
(g) Prior to the submission of a urine specimen, sworn law
enforcement officers shall complete a medical questionnaire
which clearly describes all medications, both prescription and
over-the-counter, that were ingested within the past 14 days.
(2) Specimen collection.
(a) Throughout the test process, the identity of individual
applicants, trainees and sworn law enforcement officers shall
remain confidential. Individual specimens shall be identified
throughout the process by use of social security numbers. At
no time shall an individual's name appear on any form or
specimen container sent to the State Toxicology Laboratory.
(b) Specimens will be collected utilizing equipment and supplies
approved by the State Toxicology Laboratory. Under no
circumstances may a specimen be collected and submitted for
analysis in a specimen container that has not been approved by
the State Toxicology Laboratory.
(c) Urine specimens will be acquired and processed in accordance
with procures established by the State Toxicology Laboratory
as indicated below:
§ 4-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 4-75
1:83
[1] After the monitor has inspected the appropriate forms for
accuracy, and upon confirming same, shall then allow the
applicant, trainee or sworn law enforcement officer to void
into the specimen collection container.
[2] After a specimen has been produced, the individual shall
seal the specimen container and deliver it to the monitor.
[3] Once the monitor is satisfied that the required
documentation is accurate and (s)he has inspected the
specimen container to determine that a specimen has been
produced, the monitor shall take possession of the
specimen and ensure that it is delivered to the State
Toxicology Laboratory for analysis.
(d) Individuals will void without the direct observation of the
monitor unless there is reason to believe that the individual
will adulterate the specimen or otherwise compromise the
integrity of the test process. Under these circumstances, the
production of a specimen may be directly observed by the
monitor. Internal affairs shall document the facts underlying
the belief that an individual may adulterate a specimen or
compromise the integrity of the test process.
(e) Individuals that initially are unable to produce a urine
specimen may remain under the supervision of the test monitor
until the monitor is satisfied that the individual cannot produce
a specimen. While the individual is under the supervision, the
monitor may allow the individual to drink fluids in an attempt
to induce the production of a specimen. If the individual
remains unable to produce a specimen after a reasonable
period of time, the monitor may have the individual examined
by a doctor to determine whether the inability to produce a
specimen was the result of a medical or physical infirmity, or
constituted a refusal to cooperate with the drug testing
process.
(f) Trainees and sworn law enforcement officers shall have the
option to provide the monitor with a second urine specimen at
the same time the first specimen is collected, as indicated
below:
[1] The second specimen shall be collected in the same
fashion as the first specimen. The monitor shall take
possession of the second specimen and place it in a
secured refrigerated storage area within the property
room.
[2] Internal affairs shall maintain the specimen in the property
room for a period of 60 days or until the agency receives
notification from the State Toxicology Laboratory that the
§ 4-75 UNION CITY CODE § 4-75
1:84
first specimen tested negative for the presence of
controlled substances.
[3] The second specimen shall be released from the custody of
internal affairs under the following circumstances:
[a] When internal affairs is notified by the State
Toxicology Laboratory that the first specimen tested
positive for a controlled substance.
[b] The individual whose specimen tested positive informs
internal affairs that (s)he wishes to have the specimen
independently tested.
[c] The individual officer must designate a laboratory that
is licensed as a clinical laboratory by the New Jersey
Department of Health under the New Jersey Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act to conduct the
independent test.
[d] A representative of the licensed clinical laboratory
designated by the individual officer takes possession
of the second specimen in accordance with accepted
chain of custody procedures within 60 days of the date
the specimen was produced.
[e] Under no circumstances shall the second specimen be
released directly to the individual officer.
G. Submission of specimens for analysis.
(1) The State Toxicology Laboratory within the Division of Criminal
Justice will constitute the sole facility for the analysis of law
enforcement drug tests. Law enforcement agencies are not
permitted to use any other facility or laboratory for purposes of
analyzing urine specimens.
(2) Urine specimens should be submitted to the State Toxicology
Laboratory as soon as possible after their collection. In the event a
specimen cannot be submitted to the laboratory within one working
day of its collection, then it shall be stored in a controlled-access
refrigerated storage area within the property room until
submission to the State Toxicology Laboratory.
(3) The internal affair unit shall be responsible for the transportation
of specimens to the State Toxicology Laboratory. However, should
internal affairs choose to have specimens delivered to the State
Toxicology Laboratory by commercial courier, the following
procedural safeguards must be taken:
(a) All submissions must be by next day delivery.
§ 4-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 4-75
1:85
(b) In addition to the sealed container, all submission must be
packaged in manner that includes two additional seals to
provide for the integrity of the test specimens.
(c) It is understood that the State Toxicology Laboratory must
reject specimens that it has reason to believe have been
subject to tampering.
H. Analysis of specimens. The State Toxicology Laboratory will utilize the
following test procedures to analyze urine specimens for law
enforcement agencies:
(1) All specimens will be subject to an initial test utilizing fluorescence
polarization immunoassay analysis.
(2) Those specimens that test positive for a controlled substance
following the fluorescence polarization immunoassay shall be
subject to a gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry analysis
to confirm the presence of a controlled substance.
(3) In the event a specimen is confirmed to be positive for a controlled
substance following the gas chromatography/mass
spectrophotometry, a medical review officer at the laboratory shall
compare the test results with the medical questionnaire submitted
with the specimen to determine whether any substance listed on
the questionnaire would explain the test result. The medical review
officer may direct the agency that collected the specimen to obtain
further information from the individual being tested concerning the
medications listed on the questionnaire. In the event the
questionnaire does not explain the test result, the medical review
officer shall issue a report indicating that the specimen tested
positive.

reports of positive test results shall be in writing and sent to this
agency within 15 working days of the submission. The State
Toxicology Laboratory, upon request, will provide this agency with
written documentation that one or more specimens submitted for
analysis tested negative.
(2) The State Toxicology Laboratory shall not report a specimen as
having tested positive for a controlled substance until the specimen
has undergone a confirmatory test, and the medical review officer
has reviewed the results of that test with a medical questionnaire
pertinent to that specimen.
(3) The Police Department shall notify the applicant, trainee or sworn
law enforcement officer of the results of a positive test as soon as
practicable after receipt of the report from the State Toxicology
Laboratory. Upon request, the individual may receive a copy of the
laboratory report.

A. General policy. The City of Union City has a strong commitment to
provide a work environment free from unlawful harassment based on
sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, ancestry,
atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait (AHCBT), liability for service
in the Armed Forces of the United States, creed, handicap, marital
status, nationality, genetic information, refusal to submit to genetic
testing, refusal to provide genetic information or race of that person or
of that person's spouse, partners, members, stockholders, directors,
officers, managers, superintendents, agents, employees, business
associates, suppliers or customers (collectively the "protected
classifications"). The City will not tolerate unlawful harassment. Acts or
incidents of unlawful harassment should be promptly reported in
accordance with the procedures outlined below. The City will promptly
investigate all reports of unlawful harassment. Employees who violate
this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
discharge from employment. Employees who violate this policy also risk
personal legal liability.
§ 4-101 UNION CITY CODE § 4-102
1:116
B. Violations. Conduct that may violate this policy and result in
disciplinary actions includes the following:
(1) Unwelcome remarks and actions based on the protected
classifications. This may include, but is not limited to,
inappropriate jokes, comments or posted materials.
(2) Threats or suggestions that an employee's employment work status
will be adversely affected based upon the protected classifications.

employee based upon the protected classifications.

the basis of employment decisions; or
(c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work or creates an

different from sexual attraction or flirtation. Sexual harassment is
unwelcome sexual attention which is demeaning and causes the

compliments. However, comments or behavior which may be
intended to be complimentary may be viewed by the recipient as
unwelcome and a form of sexual harassment.

be exercised by supervisors and managers whose actions or remarks
may be mistakenly perceived as unlawful harassment. The subordinate
may feel inhibited and may not disclose the unwelcome actions or
remarks by the supervisor or person of higher rank. However, unlawful
harassment is not limited to employees of different rank.

incident or pattern of activity either orally or in writing to the
Commissioner in charge of the department and to the Mayor. If the
complaint involves a direct supervisor, the employee is not required
to report the complaint to the direct supervisor. The complaint
should then be made to the Mayor or to another Commissioner.
Every effort will be made to make available to an employee
reporting such an incident or pattern of activity an appropriate
person with whom the employee will feel comfortable to discuss
his/her concerns.
(2) Investigation. Once a complaint has been registered, a prompt and
thorough investigation will proceed. After the complaint is
investigated, an appropriate representative of the City will reply to
the complaining party. If the City determines that unlawful

undertake immediate and appropriate corrective action up to and
including termination of employment.

Internet Usage Policy
[Added 9-1-2009]
§ 4-104. Overview.
A. The purpose of a policy on Internet use is not to impose restrictions that
are contrary to City of Union City's established culture of openness,
trust, and integrity but rather to protect City of Union City's employees,
partners, and the government from illegal or damaging actions by
individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly. Internet/Intranet/
Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer
equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network
accounts providing electronic mail, World Wide Web browsing, and FTP
are the property of City of Union City. These systems are to be used for
business purposes in serving the interests of the City, and for our
residents in the course of normal operations. Recognizing that the
Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems are the property of the City,
employees do not have any expectation of or right to privacy with
regard to the use of the systems.
B. Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and
support of City of Union City employees and affiliates who deal with
information and/or information systems. While this policy defines how
City employees can and can not use City electronic resources, it can not
cover every conceivable situation. Consequently, common sense and
professional courtesy will still be required. It is the responsibility of
every computer user to know these guidelines and to conduct their
activities accordingly.
C. Additionally, electronic communications may be considered government
records within the meaning of the Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A.
47:1A-1 et seq. (hereinafter "OPRA") and further may be considered
public records within the meaning of the Destruction of Public Records
Law of (1953), N.J.S.A. 47:3-15 et seq. (hereinafter "DPRL")
Accordingly, like paper documents, electronic communications must be
retained and destroyed according to established records management
procedures.

Union City. Occasional personal use is permitted when necessary;
however, any and all e-mail communications sent or received on a City
computer, whether using a City or personal (including password
protected and web-based accounts) e-mail address, are considered part
of the City's business records and may not be considered to be private
or confidential. All Internet activity on City computers, including e-mail
communications, are subject to periodic backup programs. As a result,
§ 4-104 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 4-104

any time. [Added 10-19-2010]

§ 4-108 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 4-110
1:125
B. Transmitting threatening, obscene, harassing, discriminatory, or
sexually explicit materials.
C. Accessing gambling sites.
D. Sending or forwarding chain letters. These are e-mails which either ask
you to forward them on to all your friends (or to everyone you know) or
which state that something bad will happen if you do not forward them.
E-mails of this type, which are usually warning about something
(example: computer viruses) are almost certainly hoaxes.
E. Advertising, soliciting, or selling commercial items.
F. Advertising, soliciting, or selling personal items.
G. Conducting personal or commercial business for profit.
H. Engaging in non-City sanctioned fund-raising.
I. Engaging in political activities prohibited by law.

outside City of Union City without the Business Administrator's
approval.
O. Using e-mail resulting in inadvertent commitment of the City to a
contract or agreement if it appears to the other party that you have
authority to do so. E-mails sent to external stakeholders must include
the following disclaimer:
"This transmission is confidential and may be legally privileged. If you
are not the intended recipient, please notify the sender by return email
and delete this message from your system. The City of Union
City reserves the right to monitor e-mail communication. No contract
may be concluded on behalf of the City of Union City by e-mail. If the
content of this e-mail does not relate to the business of the City of
Union City, then we do not endorse it and will accept no liability."
P. Using personal e-mail accounts for City of Union City business
purposes.
Q. Using Instant messaging on City computers unless the use is
specifically approved by the appropriate director of the employee's
department.
§ 4-110 UNION CITY CODE § 4-110
1:126
§ 4-111. E-mail etiquette.
R. Accessing chat rooms unless specifically approved in advance for each
occasion by the employee's supervisor.
A. Do not send offensive jokes, frivolous messages, or anything which may
be construed as discriminatory or harassing in nature.
B. Since the confidentiality of e-mail mail cannot be assured, do not type
anything you don't want repeated. Do not try to carry out confidential or
sensitive tasks or air controversial views on e-mail. Ask yourself: Would
I want a member of the public or a jury to read this message?
Remember that all e-mails (even deleted ones) are saved and usually
can be retrieved.
C. Respect privacy and consider this aspect before forwarding messages.
D. Be polite. E-mails can often seem abrupt, even when this is not the
intention. Use professional courtesy and discretion. The use of all
uppercase text in either the subject or the body of an e-mail should also
be avoided as this is deemed to be the e-mail equivalent of shouting.
E. Do not reply with history if it is not necessary especially if it
incorporates a large attachment. Do not send greeting cards.
Voluminous data files attached to e-mails increase network traffic
congestion often resulting in overall response time degradation.
F. Use "reply all" and distribution lists with caution in order to keep the
number of your messages to a minimum and reduce the risk of sending
messages to the wrong people.
G. Check your e-mails regularly. Set the out-of-office flag and arrange for
someone to deal with your e-mail if you are away for an extended
period.
H. Messages should be clearly addressed "To" those from whom an action
or response is expected; "cc" or "bcc" should be used for other
recipients of the message. The use of "bcc" is not recommended since
may consider this to come under the heading of "dirty pool."
I. Delete unwanted or unnecessary e-mail subject to the retention policy
identified below.
J. Unsolicited e-mail, especially with an attachment, may contain a virus,
if in doubt, delete the e-mail or contact the sender to check before
opening.
K. Enter a meaningful "subject" field to help the reader anticipate the
content correctly, and try to keep to one subject per message.
L. Don't use all or part of someone else's message without
acknowledgement. Don't edit someone else's message without making

it clear the changes that you have made and use good judgment when
considering distributing other people's messages without permission.
M. Avoid subscribing to unnecessary mailing lists. Unsubscribe from
mailing lists when they are no longer required.
N. Use discretion before selecting "request read receipt" or "request
delivery receipt" options as this may unnecessarily increase network
traffic thereby retarding overall response time. These options should be
used by exception. They should not be system default selections.
O. Once a message is sent, there is no way to retrieve it. Check carefully
that messages are addressed to the correct recipient(s) before sending.
A. The City reserves the right, to monitor, examine, copy, change, and/or
delete without notice all of its systems configurations, as well as the
files on those systems for such purposes as maintaining business
continuity, responding to a complaint of computer abuse, such as
harassment; or protecting City resources from unauthorized misuse.
B. The City neither guarantees against, nor shall it be responsible for, the
destruction, corruption, or disclosure of personal material on or by its
computer resources. Specifically, the City reserves the right to remove,
replace, or reconfigure its computer resources without formal notice to
employees (despite the fact that advance notice will normally be given).
C. If employees are maintaining personal files on City systems with
appropriate permission, they are advised to locate such files in a root
directory named "personal" to facilitate the identification and backup of
those files.
A. E-mails which are not considered government records under OPRA or
public records under DPRL may be deleted immediately from the
computer system. They are as follows:
(1) Personal correspondence. Any e-mail not received or created in the
course of City business may be deleted immediately, since it is not
an official record. Examples of the type of messages that may be
deleted are unsolicited e-mail advertisements, commonly called
"SPAM," personal messages, or the "Let's do lunch" (not a Citybusiness
meeting over lunch) or "Can I catch a ride?" type of note.
This provision is not intended and not shall not be interpreted to
allow employees to create or receive personal correspondences.
(2) Nongovernmental publications. Publications, promotional material
from vendors, and similar materials that are publicly available to
anyone are not official records unless specifically incorporated into
other official records. This includes LISTERV® messages (other
§ 4-111 UNION CITY CODE § 4-113
1:128
than those you post in your official capacity), unsolicited
promotional material, files copied or downloaded from Internet
sites, etc. These items may be deleted immediately, or maintained
in a "Non-Record" mailbox and deleted at a later time, just as you
might trash unwanted publications or promotional flyers received
in the mail. However, for example, if you justify the purchase
of a "Zip Filing System" by incorporating the reviews you saved
(from the "Files R Us LISTSERV®") in your proposal to your boss,
those LISTSERV® messages become official records and must be
retained in accordance with the retention schedule for purchasing
proposals.
B. Transient documents are considered government records under OPRA
or public records under DPRL and are to be retained as follows:
(1) Much of the communication via e-mail has a very limited
administrative value. For instance, an e-mail message notifying
employees of an upcoming meeting would only have value until the
meeting has been attended or the employee receiving the message
has marked the date and time in his/her calendar.
(2) Transient messages do not set policy, establish guidelines or
procedures, certify a transaction or become a receipt. The informal
tone of transitory messages might be compared to a
communication that might take place during a telephone
conversation or conversation in an office hallway. These types of
records are transient documents and can be scheduled using the
General Retention Schedules established by the State Records
Committee. Transient documents include telephone messages
(such as "While You Were Out" notes), drafts, and other documents
that serve to convey information of temporary importance in lieu of
oral communication. E-mail messages of a similar nature should be
retained until they are no longer of administrative value and then
destroyed.
C. Intermediate documents are considered government records under
OPRA or public records under DPRL and are to be retained as follows:
(1) E-mail messages that have more significant administrative, legal
and/or fiscal value but are not scheduled as transient or permanent
should be categorized under other appropriate record series. These
may include but are not limited to:
(a) General correspondence. Including correspondence from
various individuals, companies, and organizations requesting
information pertaining to agency and legal interpretations and
other miscellaneous inquiries. This correspondence is
informative; it does not attempt to influence agency policy.
(b) Internal correspondence. Including letters, memos, and
requests for routine information; monthly and weekly reports;
§ 4-113 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 4-113
1:129
and documents advising supervisors of various events, issues,
and status of ongoing projects.
(c) Minutes of agency staff meetings. Minutes and supporting
records documenting internal policy decisions.
(2) Retention. These categories of e-mail should be retained for the
appropriate period of time per the records retention schedules
approved under the General Retention Schedules for the City.
D. Permanent documents are considered government records under OPRA
or public records under DPRL and are to be retained as follows:
(1) E-mail messages that have significant administrative, legal and/or
fiscal value and are scheduled as permanent also should be
categorized under the appropriate record series. These may
include but are not limited to:
(a) Executive correspondence.
[1] Correspondence of the head of an agency dealing with
significant aspects of the administration of their offices.
Correspondence includes information concerning agency
policies, program, fiscal and personnel matters.
[2] Retention shall be three years, then, periodic review for
transfer to archives in accordance with standards and
protocols.
(b) Departmental policies and procedures.
[1] Includes published reports, unpublished substantive
reports and policy studies.
[2] Retention. Retain until superseded, obsolete or replaced,
then periodic review for transfer to archives in accordance
with standards and protocols.
(c) Minutes of boards, commissions, etc. Including approved
minutes of official bodies, attachments, and transmittal
documents. This does not apply to drafts of minutes or minutes
that have not been approved. Copies may be retained in
electronic form, but retention of hard copy is required.
(2) Retention. Permanent, Periodic review for transfer to archives in
accordance with standards and protocols.
E. Distribution lists are considered government records under OPRA or
public records under DPRL and are to be retained as follows: If you
send to a "distribution list" (not a LISTSERV®, but a specified list of
individuals), you must also keep a copy of the members of that list for as
long as you are required to keep the message itself. It is of little value to
know that the "Security Alert" notice went to "SWAT Team 7," without
§ 4-113 UNION CITY CODE § 4-113
1:130
knowing whether "Arnold S." received the message. Nicknames present
a similar problem.

§ 14-1. Compliance with Statute.
The City of Union City shall comply with the residency requirements as set
forth in the New Jersey First Act, N.J.S.A. 52:14-7.
§ 14-2. Effect on current employees; definitions.
§ 14-3. Applicability; autonomous agencies.
A. No current City employee's employment shall be affected by the fact of
nonresidence at the time that this chapter is finally adopted. Current
employees who are not currently residing in City at the time of final
adoption of this chapter are expressly grandfathered hereunder. The
City reserves all other rights it may have in regards to such employees'
continued employment, except for any claims the City may have against
such continued employment on the grounds of an employee's residency
at the time of the final adoption of this chapter and except as otherwise
set out herein.
B. A bona fide "resident" is defined as any person having a single legal
residence within the City of Union City, as the term "single legal
residence" is defined in N.J.A.C. 4A:4-2.11(c).
A. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all municipal officers and
employees not otherwise exempt from residency requirements by
statute and also shall not apply to persons rendering special, unique or
professional services to the City of Union City, including but not limited
to doctors, architects, engineers, nurses, scientific or chemical
analysts, attorneys, accountants, auditors and planners, City Clerk,
Deputy City Clerk, subject to the requirements set forth in N.J.S.A.
40A:9-133 et seq., and Chief Financial Officer, subject to the
requirements set forth in N.J.S.A. 40A:9-140.1 et seq., and Municipal
Judges. Further, when the appointing authority determines that there
are certain specific positions and employments, requiring special
talents or skills which are necessary for the operations of the City and
for which the appointing authority believes would benefit from
expanding the pool of applicants to New Jersey residents who are not
residents of Union City, such positions or employments so determined
shall be filled without reference to residency.

agencies or authorities of the City of Union City shall adhere to the
residency policy set forth in this chapter when hiring employees, agents
or servants.
C. With respect to the positions of police officer and civilian dispatcher
and candidates for these positions, residency, for purposes of
consideration of appointment to the employ of the City and inclusion on
any Civil Service employment eligibility list for the City, shall be as of

maintained from the closing date of the examination up to and including
the date of appointment to the employ of the City.
A. Failure of any employee to maintain residency in the City, when
required to do so under the terms of this chapter, shall be cause for
removal or discharge from service.
B. Investigations of residence authorized. The Mayor and Commissioners
of the City of Union City, or a duly appointed agent, are hereby
authorized to investigate into the residency of any officer, employee or
appointee to any board and to require the officer, employee or
appointee to any board to produce proof of bona fide residence. The
standards as set forth in N.J.A.C. 4A:4-2.11 shall be used to make the
residence determination.
C. Notice of charges of nonresidence; hearing. The officer, employee or
appointee to any board shall be given a ten-day notice setting forth the
charge that he is not a bona fide resident of the City of Union City. The
notice shall also set forth the time and place of hearing to be held by the
Mayor and Commissioners, and the officer, employee or appointee to
any board shall be entitled to a full hearing.
D. Failure to appear to comply with requirements shall be cause for
dismissal. Failure of any officer, employee or appointee to any board of
the City of Union City, other than those who have a statutory exemption,
to appear at the time and place of the hearing set forth in the notice or
to comply with the residence requirements shall be sufficient cause for
his removal or discharge from service.
E. In the event an employee does not maintain bona fide residency when
required to do so, the hiring authority shall notify said employee that
failure to again take up bona fide residency in the local unit within six
months of such notification will result in removal or discharge from
service. Such removal or discharge shall take effect on the date
specified in such notice, but any employee so removed or discharged
shall have the right to such appeals as are available pursuant to law.

exceeding six months.
B. No application for an extension of time shall be granted unless it is
submitted to the Mayor, in writing.
C. No application for an extension of time shall be granted unless the
applicant states, in writing, his or her intention to become a bona fide

D. In considering good cause for an extension of time, the Mayor and
Board of Commissioners shall take into consideration the length of time
the applicant has been a nonresident; problems related to the sale of a
home or in the purchase of a home within Union City; financial
problems concerning existing leases; difficulties in locating suitable

ALARM SYSTEMS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Fees  See Ch. 155. Fire prevention  See Ch. 171.
§ 52-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Ordinance to Provide
for the Regulation and Control of the Installation, Operation and
Maintenance of Alarm Systems in the City of Union City."
§ 52-2. Findings; declaration; purpose.
(3) Circumstances such as age and design of fuel-burning equipment
or system, types of incinerator, particular use of premises or other
factors which render systematic inspections of such buildings
necessary in the interest of public health and safety.
B. If the Judge of the Municipal Court of the City is satisfied as to the
matters set forth in the affidavit, (s)he shall authorize the issuance of a
search warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part of the
premises on which the nuisance or violation may exist.
A. Findings. The large increase in the number of private alarm systems
and users connected into the Police Department and the number of
false alarms, relative to holdups, burglary and other similar types of
alarms, have resulted in an increasing demand upon public personnel,
as well as upon the present facilities available to the Police Department.
B. Declaration. In addition to the foregoing, the increase in the number of
private enterprises engaged in the alarm business, each with its own
system and equipment, has resulted in conditions that if not remedied
will lead to an unnecessary drain upon the manpower, time, facilities
and finances of the City and its Public Safety Department. If the present
system is not corrected and improved upon, there will follow a
deterioration of the quality of service to all persons subscribing to
alarm services.
C. Purpose.

CENTRAL STATION  A communications center receiving signals from an
alarm signaling device which is operated for its subscribers. Such central
location is maintained and supervised on a continuous basis by trained
operators who will take appropriate action upon receipt of an emergency
signal from an alarm signal device, including the relaying of such
information directly to the Police Department communications center.
DIAL ALARM  An alarm device that employs an automatic dialing system
precoded to connect with a telephone in police headquarters rather than to
the alarm console with an automatic cutoff.
FALSE ALARM  The activation of an alarm system by causes other than
those to which the alarm system was designed or intended to respond or
activate.
LOCAL ALARM or PRIVATE ALARM  Any mechanism that constitutes, in
whole or in part, an alarm system that is operated by a private company at
a location other than the property in the City.

1:188

ARTICLE III
Preservation of Trees
[Adopted 2-2-2016]
§ 87-10. Purpose and intent.
§ 87-11. Definitions.
The terms below as used in this article shall have the meanings established
by the International Society of Arboriculture, as supplemented below:
CALIPER: ANSI Z60 FOR NURSERY STOCK  "Caliper" is a type of
diameter measurement used in the nursery industry. The height
measurement shall be taken from ground level for field-grown stock and
from the soil line for container-grown stock, which should be at or near
the top of the root flare. Caliper measurement of the trunk shall be taken
six inches above the top of root flare up to and including four-inch caliper
size. If the caliper at six inches above the ground exceeds four inches, the
caliper should be measured at 12 inches above the top of root flare. Seldom
are tree trunks perfectly round. The most accurate measurement will result
from the use of a diameter tape. Caliper measurements taken with manual
or electronic slot or pincer type caliper tools should be the average of the
smallest and largest measurements.
DIAMETER BREAST HEIGHT (DBH)  The diameter of a tree measured
4 1/2 feet above the uphill/highest side.
A. Indiscriminate, uncontrolled and excess destruction, removal and
cutting of trees upon lots and tracts of land within Union City will cause
increased drainage control costs, increased soil erosion and
sedimentation, decreased fertility of the soil, degradation of water
resources, decreased groundwater recharge, increased buildup of
atmospheric carbon dioxide, the establishment of a heat island effect
and increased dust and pollution. The singular or cumulative effect of
any of the foregoing could adversely impact the character of Union City,
decrease property values, render the land unfit and unsuitable for its
most appropriate use, and negatively affect the health, safety and
general welfare of Union City's residents. Thus, the City governing body
desires to regulate and control indiscriminate and excessive cutting of
trees within the City and to require appropriate tree replacement.
B. It is recognized that there is a strong interrelationship between the
integrity of the City's water resources, development on steep slopes,
tree removal, soil disturbance, stormwater management and the
general use of the land resources. Fewer trees throughout the City also
correlates with increased air pollution. Therefore, the governing body
finds that the appropriate management of these resources is an
important health, safety and general welfare concern. It is the intention
of the City of Union City to control the cutting, removal and destruction
of trees within the City, thereby preserving the maximum number of
trees for the purposes stated herein.
§ 87-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 87-11
1:247
DRIP LINE  The line formed by water dripping from the outermost
branches of a tree.
EMERGENCY  Any event or condition which has damaged or destroyed a
tree, such that the continued presence of such damaged or destroyed tree
imminently threatens harm to life or property in proximity thereto.
OWNER  Any person having title or lawful possession of any lot, plot or
parcel of land within the City.
PRIVATE TREE  Any tree located on private land within the City.
PROTECTIVE BARRIER  A barrier constructed to protect the root system

the record.
B. Individuals shall be made aware of the criminal background check
procedures during the appointive or employment process. Appointment
to, or Department of Recreation employment or continued service
pursuant to the appointment, or continued Department of Recreation
employment, is contingent upon an acceptable criminal background
check, and any written acceptance of appointment, or Department of
Recreation employment, must contain notice of this contingency.
Criminal background checks, when possible, shall be completed within
30 days of the consent of the appointee or Department of Recreation
employee.
A. Detention and/or arrest without conviction shall not be grounds for
appointive or Department of Recreation employment decisions and
cannot play a part in the decisionmaking process. Only criminal
convictions or pleas of guilty or nolo contendre will be considered in
determining an appointee's or Department of Recreation employee's
suitability for appointment or Department of Recreation employment or
continued appointment or continued Department of Recreation
employment. In assessing a record of criminal convictions, an
appointment or Department of Recreation employment decision will be
made by assessing:
(1) The nature and severity of the offense(s) as well as a variety of
surrounding facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
(a) The age of the individual at the time of the offense(s);
(b) The number of offenses for which the individual was convicted;
(c) The time which has elapsed since the last offense; and

A. The Board of Commissioners is authorized to enact an ordinance
establishing curfews for juveniles pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.52(b).
§ 131-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-1

§ 137-2. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When consistent with
the appropriate context, words used in the present tense include the future,
words in the plural include the singular, and words in the singular include
the plural. The word "shall" is considered to be mandatory and not merely
directory or discretionary in nature.
CITY  The City of Union City.
EMERGENCY  An unforeseen combination of circumstances or the
resulting state, including those circumstances which call for immediate
action in response to a threat to public health and safety. This term shall
be understood to include but not be limited to a fire, a natural disaster,
an automobile accident or other situation requiring immediate action to
prevent serious bodily harm, injury or loss of life. "Serious bodily injury"
shall mean bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that
B. The Board of Commissioners of the City of Union City hereby finds
based upon information provided by the Chief of Police that there has
been a continued breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally
provided by certain parents for juveniles under 18 years of age
resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable
behavior during the late evening hours, including vandalism, noisy and
rowdy behavior, breaking and entering, public drinking and littering,
and harassment of residents both as perpetrators and victims.
C. The Board of Commissioners further finds that the offensive activities
by and towards the juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws
and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever
police officers are present, and the establishment of reasonable curfew
regulations will enable the community to better control the free and
unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of
residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to
prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles.
D. The Board of Commissioners further finds and has determined that a
curfew meets a compelling local need and that curfew ordinances in
other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile
delinquency. A curfew in Union City is particularly appropriate in view
of the high density of population in a relatively small geographic area in
Union City and the mixed use of residential and commercial areas
throughout the City. The regulation of juveniles is an attempt to
minimize danger to the juveniles and the community during the
dangerous hours for nocturnal crime and mischief, which could be
accentuated because of the juvenile's immaturity.
E. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is an accepted
norm by a substantial majority of the community and many parents
have expressed a desire to have a curfew in order to augment their
efforts to supervise and guide their children.

whereabouts of a minor in the legal custody of a parent or guardian. It is
intended to include and require neglectful or careless parents to maintain

objective test. It shall be no defense to this chapter that a parent was
indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such a minor or
juvenile.
LEGAL GUARDIAN  A person over the age of 18, other than a parent, to
whom legal custody of the juvenile has been given by court order or other
method required by law.

purpose, whether not-for-profit or for-profit.

§ 137-3. Curfew for juveniles. [Amended 2-15-2005]
It shall be unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to be on or remain
in or upon the public streets and public places within the City of Union City:
A. During the period ending at 5:00 a.m. and beginning:
(1) At 11:59 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights from September 15
through June 15.
(2) At 11:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday nights from September 15
through June 15.
(3) At 11:59 p.m. all nights from June 15 through September 15.
§ 137-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-3
1:285
§ 137-4. Exceptions.
In the following exceptional cases a minor who remains in or upon a public
street or public place during the hours specified in § 137-3 above, minors,
their parents and their fellow-citizens shall not, however, be considered in
violation of this chapter:
(4) During the hours when the juvenile is required to be in attendance
at either a public or nonpublic school subject to the exceptions
enumerated in § 137-4.
A. When accompanied by a parent or legal guardian of such minor.
B. When accompanied by an adult authorized in writing by a parent or
legal guardian of such minor to take said parent's place in
accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose
within a specified area.
C. When the juvenile is on the sidewalk or property where the juvenile
permanently resides.
D. When going to, without making any detour or stop and within one hour
prior to the commencement of an official extracurricular school activity
or other official cultural, educational, recreational, sporting or social
event sponsored by a school, by the City, or by a religious, civic,
voluntary or other community-based association, and supervised by
adults of which prior notice by the organization or entity sponsoring the
event, indicating the place and probable time of termination, has been
given in writing, to and duly filed for immediate reference by the Chief
of Police or officer assigned by the Chief on duty at the police station.
E. When returning home, without making any detour or stop, after the
termination of any activity whether sponsored by a school, by the City,
or by a religious, civic, voluntary or other community-based association
and including all private activities within 1/2 hour after the termination
of such activity so long as the juvenile has in his or her possession
written permission from his or her parent or legal guardian.
F. When authorized, by special permit from the Chief of Police or the
officer designated by the Chief for that purpose, carried on the person
of the juvenile thus authorized, which may be issued only when
necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile are required but are not
otherwise addressed by any provision of this chapter. When the Chief of
Police or his designee shall determine that the necessary nighttime
activities of a juvenile warrant, a special permit for the event may be
granted upon written application of the juvenile's parent or legal
guardian and signed by the juvenile specifying the following and filed
with the Department: 1) the name, address, and telephone number of a
parent or legal guardian of the juvenile; 2) the height, weight, sex, color
of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the juvenile; 3) the
necessity which requires the juvenile to remain upon the public streets
§ 137-3 UNION CITY CODE § 137-4
1:286
§ 137-5. Parental responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for a parent or guardian having legal custody of a
juvenile knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow the juvenile
to be or remain upon any public place under circumstances not constituting
an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of this chapter. The term
"knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be
expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent's
or places during the curfew hours otherwise applicable; and 4) the
street or route and destination as well as the beginning and ending
of the period of time involved by date and hour. In an emergency, as
defined by this chapter, this application may be made by telephone
or in person, with a corresponding written record being made
contemporaneously to the Chief of Police or his designee at the police
station.
G. When authorized, by regulation issued by the Chief of Police, to respond
to cases of reasonable necessity adapted to necessary nighttime
activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an
individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Chief
of Police permitting use of the public place should be issued sufficiently
in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and
through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the
activity, the scope of the use of the public streets or places permitted,
the period of time involved not to extend more than one hour beyond
the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that
the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the
purposes of this chapter.
H. When the juvenile carries a certified card of employment dated or
reissued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the juvenile's
employer and the Chief of Police identifying the juvenile, the address of
his home and of his place of employment, and his hours of employment.
I. On an errand at the direction of the minor's parent or guardian, without
making any detour or stop for the purpose of responding to a medical
problem or emergency.
J. In a motor vehicle involved in interstate travel not originating in the
City.
K. Involved in an emergency as defined in § 137-2 of this chapter.
L. Married or had been married or had disabilities of minority removed in
accordance with law.
M. When engaging in an activity protected by the First Amendment so long
as the Chief or his designee receive prior written notice in advance of
such activity and the juvenile has the written permission of his or her
parent or legal guardian in his or her possession at the time the activity
is engaged in.
§ 137-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-5
1:287
legal custody. This section is intended to hold neglectful or careless parents
up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through
an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was
completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such
juvenile.
§ 137-6. Enforcement procedure.
If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is upon a public street
or public place in violation of this chapter without any of the exceptions
applying, the officer shall notify the juvenile that he or she is in violation
of this chapter and shall require the juvenile to provide his or her name,
address and telephone number and how to contact his or her parent or
legal guardian. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of
convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer shall, in the
first instance, use his or her best judgment in determining age.
A. The Chief of Police may require that the responding police officer or a
designee within the Police Department deliver to a parent or guardian
thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances to his or her home
whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are known.
B. In any event the police officer shall, within 24 hours, file a written
report with the Chief of Police or shall participate to the extent of the
information for which he is responsible in the preparation of a report on
the curfew violation. It is not the intention of this section to require
reports that will prevent police officers from performing their primary
police duties. The reports shall be as simple as is reasonably possible
and may be completed by Police Department personnel other than
sworn police officers.
C. When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take
charge of the juvenile and the appropriate information has been
recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If
the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then
the juvenile shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the
extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance
by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an
adult, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent or
guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending
the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian.
D. In the case of a first violation by a juvenile, the Chief of Police shall, by
certified mail, send to a parent or guardian written notice of the
violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full
enforcement of this chapter against the parent or guardian and
juvenile, including enforcement of applicable penalties. No penalties
shall be sought against parent or guardian and the juvenile in the case
of a first violation although the parent or guardian shall be contacted to
retrieve the juvenile. A copy of the notice of first violation shall be
maintained by the Police Department. An additional copy of the notice
§ 137-5 UNION CITY CODE § 137-6
1:288
§ 137-7. Violations and penalties.
Chapter 145
DRUG-FREE ZONES
of first violation shall be kept on file by the Municipal Court
Administrator of Union City for the purpose of providing evidence of
failure by the minor, as well as the parent or guardian, to observe the
provisions of this chapter in the event of any subsequent citation for an
alleged violation of this chapter. No written warning shall be issued for
any subsequent violation of this chapter.
A. Community service. Any person, juvenile or adult convicted of a
violation of this chapter shall be required to perform community service
as directed by the court. As provided in N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.52, whenever
both a juvenile and the juvenile's parent or guardian violate the chapter,
they shall be required to perform community service together.
B. Fines. Any juvenile convicted of a violation of this chapter shall be
subject to a fine of $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second offense and
not less than $150 nor more than $1,000 for any third subsequent
offense. Any parent or guardian convicted of a violation, after the
warning notice pursuant to § 137-6 of a first violation by a juvenile, shall
be fined $50 and for a second offense by a parent or guardian the fine
shall be $100. For any subsequent offense by a parent, the fine shall not
be less than $150 and not more than $1,000.
C. A person who violates a provision of this chapter is guilty of a separate
offense for each day or part of a day during which the violation is
committed, continued or permitted.

any changes in the location and boundaries of such property which have
not yet been incorporated into a revised approved map, shall not be
deemed to be an official finding and record that such property is not
owned by or leased to a school or school board, or that such property is

A. In adopting this chapter it is the intention of the Board of
Commissioners to create an agency which can administer a system of
preservation regulations, based on a rational plan and objective
criteria, which will complement existing land use and construction code
legislation. The controls herein established, while compatible with
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-28(b)(6) and Section 317 of the BOCA Code, should be
viewed as having an independent basis under N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.
B. This chapter should not be viewed as requiring or prohibiting the use of
any particular architectural style. Rather, the purpose is to preserve the
past by making it compatible with and relevant to the present. To that
end, new construction in or near a landmark should not necessarily
§ 214-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 214-3
1:351
§ 214-4. Designation of landmarks and Historic Districts.
duplicate the style of the landmark; it should simply be compatible with
and not detract from the landmark.
A. Survey. The Commission shall make a comprehensive survey of the City
for the purpose of identifying Historic Districts and landmarks which
are worthy of protection and preservation.
B. Designation of landmarks; notice to owners. Based on the survey or
upon the recommendation of concerned citizens, the Commission shall
document the importance and historical significance to the City, state or
nation of each landmark designation in terms of the purposes and
criteria set forth in this chapter. Thereafter, the Commission, by
certified mail, shall:
(1) Notify each owner that his property has been tentatively
designated an historic landmark.
(2) Advise each owner of the significance and consequences of such
tentative designation, and advise him/her of his/her opportunities
and rights to challenge or contest such designation.
(3) Invite each owner to consent voluntarily to final designation
without the need for public hearing or other procedure.
C. Public hearings.
(1) The Commission shall, as soon as practicable, make public a
complete list and map of the tentatively designated landmarks and
districts specifying the locations, boundaries and popular names
thereof. In designating any landmark or Historic district the
Commission may exempt any improvement or any portion of any
Tax Map lot the demolition or alteration or improving of which
would not affect the landmark or district as to the purposes and
criteria set forth in this chapter. Such exemption shall only be for
good cause shown and upon affirmative vote of 2/3 of the full
authorized membership of the Commission, The tentative list and
map shall thereafter be submitted at a public hearing to the
examination and criticism of the public. Interested persons shall be
entitled to present their opinions, suggestions and objections at
this public hearing. A list and map showing all proposed Historic
districts and landmarks shall be published, together with notice of
the hearing on same, in the official newspaper not less than 10 days
before such hearing is to be held.
(2) After full consideration of the evidence brought forth at the special
hearing, the Commission shall make its final decisions on the
designations and shall issue its final report to the public stating
reasons in support of its actions with respect to each landmark and
Historic District designation.
§ 214-3 UNION CITY CODE § 214-4
1:352
§ 214-5. Procedures to ensure preservation.
D. Adoption of list.
(1) The list shall be submitted thereafter to the Clerk. The Board of
Commissioners shall then consider whether to adopt the
designation list and map by ordinance. Once adopted, the
designation list and map may be amended in the same manner in
which it was adopted.
(2) Copies of the designation list and official map as adopted shall be
made public and distributed to all municipal agencies reviewing
development applications and all building and housing permits. A
certificate of designation shall be served by certified mail upon the
owner of each site included in the final list, and a true copy thereof
shall be filed with the County Clerk for recordation in the same
manner as certificates of lien upon real property.
E. Plaques. Each designated Historic District or landmark may be marked
by an appropriate plaque, in such form as the Commission shall
promulgate by regulation.
A. Certificates of appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness issued
by the Landmarks Commission shall be required before a permit can be
issued or, in the event no other type of permit is otherwise required,
before any of the following work can commence on the property of any
landmark or within any Historic District:
(1) Demolition of a historic landmark or of any improvement within any
Historic District.
(2) Relocation of any historic landmark or of any improvement within
any Historic District.

no certificate of appropriateness shall be required for one unlit sign
per premises if the surface area of such sign does not exceed one
square foot.
B. Exceptions. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for
any repainting, repair or exact replacement of any existing
improvement. In the event that the color or exterior surface material of
the improvement is changed as a result of such repainting, repair or
exact replacement, a certificate of appropriateness shall not be
required of the new color or exterior surface is one that has been
previously approved by regulations duly promulgated by the
§ 214-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 214-5
1:353
Commission for similar improvement in that district or as to that
landmark. In the event that the repainting, repair or exact replacement
does not conform to the regulations, a certificate of appropriateness
shall be required.
C. Applications for certificates.
(1) Application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made on
forms available therefor from the secretary of the Landmarks
Commission. Completed applications shall be delivered to:
Landmarks Commission, City of Union City, City Clerk's Office,
3715 Palisade Avenue, Union City, NJ 07087.
(2) Applications shall include the following:
(a) All forms shall be completed by the applicant.
(b) A certificate that all property owners within 200 feet of the lot
lines of the landmark property have been sent certified mail
notice of the application not less than 10 days before the
hearing.
(c) Proof of publication of a notice of the application in the official
newspaper not less than 10 days prior to the hearing.
(d) The following exhibits:
[1] An overall site plan layout, at a minimum scale of one inch
equals 20 feet, showing the location of all adjacent
properties.
[2] Sufficient color photographs of all adjacent properties and
buildings within a minimum of 60 feet of the landmark
property lines. Each photograph shall be properly
identified and referenced on the site plan.
[3] Elevation drawings may be optional at the Commission's
request. All building elevations required shall be at a
minimum scale of 1/8 inch equals one foot.
(3) The Landmarks Commission shall reach a decision on the
application within 21 days after the secretary has declared an
application to be complete; otherwise the application shall be
deemed to have been approved. Nothing herein shall prohibit an
extension of time by mutual agreement of the applicant and the
Landmarks Commission. The Landmarks Commission may advise
the applicant and make recommendations in regard to the
appropriateness of proposed action, and may grant approval upon
such conditions as it deems appropriate within the intent and
purposes of this chapter. If an application is approved, the
Landmarks Commission shall forthwith issue a certificate of
appropriateness. If the Landmarks Commission disapproves an
application, the Commission shall state its reasons, in writing, in
§ 214-5 UNION CITY CODE § 214-5
1:354
resolution form, within 10 days of such decision. In case of
disapproval, the Landmarks Commission shall notify the applicant,
in writing, of such resolution of disapproval and provide the
applicant with a certified copy thereof. A summary of the
Commission's action shall be published in the official newspaper.
(4) In the event that an applicant alleges that compliance with the
requirements of this section would be an unreasonable hardship
and that the nature of his application is such that the minor change
sought neither justifies the time and expense of the plenary
proceeding nor will impact negatively on the public good nor
specifically on the historic qualities sought to be preserved. The
Commission, by a two-thirds affirmative vote of its full authorized
membership, may grant such relief from the requirements of this
section as it deems consistent with the public good and the
purposes of this chapter.
(5) An applicant may allege that a certificate of appropriateness should
be granted without his/her fulfilling all of the application
requirements set forth herein because the addition or alteration
contemplated will not be visible from any place to which the public
normally has access and, therefore, that the addition or alteration
cannot adversely affect the public interest. In that event the
Commission, by a majority vote of its full authorized membership,
upon a finding that the applicant's claim is accurate, may forthwith
grant a certificate of appropriateness on that basis.
D. Issuance of certificate; effects. Issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness shall be deemed to be final approval pursuant to this
chapter. Such approval shall neither cause nor prevent the filing of any
collateral application or other proceeding required by any other City
ordinance to be made prior to undertaking the action requested vis-avis
the landmark or structure in the Historic District.
E. Denial; appeal.
(1) Denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed to
preclude the applicant from undertaking the activity applied for
vis-a-vis a landmark or improvement in a Historic District.
(2) The granting or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may be
appealed to the Board of Commissioners in the same manner as if
the appeal were taken, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-17 from action
by the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(3) Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right of judicial review
of the municipal action after an appeal is concluded by the Board of
Commissioners.
F. Permit review. All municipal officials reviewing all permit applications
involving real property or improvements thereon shall determine
whether such application involves any activity which should also be the
§ 214-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 214-5
1:355
§ 214-6. Standards of consideration.
subject of an application for a certificate of appropriateness. If it
should, such official shall inform both the secretary of the Commission
and the applicant.

or any improvement within a Historic District, the following matters
shall be considered:
(1) Its historic, architectural and aesthetic significance.
(2) Its use.
(3) Its importance to the City and the extent to which its historical or
architectural value is such that its removal would be detrimental to
the public interest.
(4) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon design,
craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be reproduced
or could be reproduced only with great difficulty.
(5) The extent to which its retention would promote the general
welfare by maintaining and increasing real estate values,
generating business, creating new jobs, attracting tourists,
students, writers, historians, artists and artisans, attracting new
residents, encouraging study and interest in American history,
stimulating interest and study in architecture and design,
educating citizens in American culture and heritage or making the
City a more attractive and desirable place in which to live.
(6) If it is within a Historic District, the probable impact of its removal
upon the ambience of the Historic District.
B. Removals out of the City. In regard to an application to move a historic
landmark within a Historic District, to a location outside the City, the
following matters shall be considered:
(1) The historic loss to the site of original location.
(2) The compelling reasons for not retaining the landmark or structure
at its present site.

compatibility of the proposed structure with the structures and
surroundings to which it would be visually related shall be considered
in terms of the visual compatibility factors as set forth in Subsection G.
E. Consideration on other actions. In regard to an application for other
approval of any proposed action as set forth in § 214-5A, the following
matters shall be considered:
(1) If a historic landmark or a structure in a Historic District is
involved:

reproduced only with great difficulty.
(2) The use of any structure involved.
(3) The extent to which the proposed action would adversely affect the
public's view of a landmark or structure within a Historic District
from a public street.
(4) If the application deals with a structure within a Historic District,

determining the visual compatibility of a building, structure or
appurtenance thereof with the buildings and places to which they are
visually related and shall be known as "visual compatibility factors":
(1) Height. The height of the proposed building shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(2) Proportion of the front facade. The relationship of the width of the
building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related.

cohesive walls of enclosure along a street, to the extent necessary
to maintain visual compatibility of the building with the buildings
and places to which it is visually related.
(10) Scale of building. The size of a building, the mass of a building in
relation to open spaces, the windows, door openings, porches and
balconies shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places

related in its directional character, whether this is vertical
character, horizontal character, or nondirectional character.
A. Findings. Recognizing the need for preventive maintenance to ensure
the continued useful life of landmarks and structures in Historic
Districts, the Board of Commissioners hereby declares that code
enforcement vis-a-vis landmarks and structures in Historic Districts is a
high municipal priority.
B. Notice of violations. In the event that any landmark or improvement in a
Historic District deteriorates to the point that, in the best estimate of
the Department of Inspections, the cost of correcting the outstanding
code violations equals more than 25% of the cost of replacing the entire
improvement on which the violations occur, the Department shall serve
personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice on the
owner of the landmark listing the violations, the estimate for their
abatement, and the replacement cost of the improvement and stating
that if the owner does not take all necessary remedial action within 90
days, or such extensions as the Department shall for good cause grant,
the City may, at the expiration of 90 days, enter upon the property and
abate such violations itself and cause the cost thereof to become a lien
on the property.
C. Hearing.
(1) Upon receipt of such notice the owner, within 10 days after such
receipt, may notify the Department of Inspections of his/her wish to
have a hearing as to the allegations and estimates set forth in the
department's notice. Such hearing shall be conducted by the
construction official and so far as possible, by a formal adversary
proceeding in which the Department of Inspections, shall establish
the matters alleged in the notice by a preponderance of the
evidence.
(2) If the owner does not request a hearing, the procedures set forth in
Subsection B shall prevail. If a hearing is requested, the
Construction Official, within 10 days following the hearing, will
serve on the owner an opinion, in writing, setting forth his/her
conclusions and the reasons therefor. Such opinion shall be deemed
to be a first notice pursuant to Subsection B.
D. Abatement by City.
(1) Thereafter, if the owner does not comply, the Department may
enter onto the premises and, by use of municipal labor or outside
contractors or both, perform such work as is necessary to abate all
violations.
(2) The head of the Department shall then certify to the Board of
Commissioners the cost of such work, plus all administrative,
§ 214-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 214-7
1:359
§ 214-8. Violations and penalties.
Chapter 219
clerical and legal costs and overhead attributable thereto and shall
present same to the Commissioners.
(3) The Board of Commissioners, by resolution, may vote to cause the
sum so certified to become a lien upon the landmark property
payable with the next quarter's property taxes, and if not then paid
shall bear interest at the same rate as delinquent taxes.
A. Violation.
(1) If any person shall undertake any activity vis-a-vis a landmark or
improvement within a Historic District without first having
obtained a certificate or appropriateness, such person shall be
deemed to be in violation of this chapter.
(2) Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer shall personally
serve upon the owner of the lot whereon the violation is occurring,
a notice describing the violation in detail and giving the owner 10
days to abate the violation by restoring the landmark or
improvement to its status quo ante. If the owner cannot be
personally served within the City with the notice, a copy shall be
posted on site and a copy sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the owner at his/her last known address as it appears
on the municipal tax rolls.
(3) In the event that the violation is not abated within 10 days of
service or posting on site, whichever is earlier, the Zoning Officer
shall cause to be issued a summons and complaint, returnable in
the Municipal Court, charging violation of this chapter. Each
separate day the violation exists shall be deemed to be a new and
separate violation of this chapter.
B. Penalties. The penalty for violations shall be as follows:
(1) Up to 10 days: not more than $25 per day.
(2) Eleven to 25 days: not more than $50 per day.
(3) Each day beyond 25 days: not more than $75 per day.
C. Emergency procedures. In the event that any action which would
permanently change adversely the landmark or Historic District such as
demolition or removal is about to occur without a certificate of
appropriateness having been issued, the Zoning Officer is hereby
authorized to apply to the Superior Court of New Jersey for such
injunctive relief as is necessary to prevent the destruction of any
landmark.

and proposed development with regard to urban design, pedestrian
and vehicular circulation, infrastructure improvements, public
access to the waterfront, and public open space.
C. Blocks.
(1) Geometry. Blocks shall be rectangular except where preexisting
diagonal streets, natural features, municipal boundaries or railroad
rights-of-way dictate otherwise.
(2) Boundaries. Block boundaries shall be defined by:
(a) Streets or pedestrianways which conform to the requirements
of § 223-11N;
(b) Municipal boundaries; and/or
(c) Other unusual natural features such as cliffs.
(3) Block dimensions.
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:419

(c) In areas with steeply sloping topography or other unusual
natural features or adjacent to municipal boundaries, the
approving authority may permit longer or shorter blocks than
provided hereinabove.
D. Curbs and gutters.
(1) Concrete or granite curb shall be installed along all streets. Curbs
shall also be required along all edges of pavement within a site,
except where natural drainage methods are utilized. Curb and
gutter design details shall be in conformance with current
engineering standards and shall be subject to approval by the
enforcing agency.
(2) Barrier-free curb ramps shall be constructed at all intersections
and other appropriate locations in accordance with accessible
design standards promulgated by the New Jersey Department of
Transportation.
E. Fences and walls.
(1) Height. The maximum height of a fence, wall or railing shall be four
feet in front and side yards and six feet in any rear yard.
(2) Materials. Fences, walls and gates adjacent to public rights-of-way
shall be constructed of a durable and decorative material such as
decorative aluminum or wrought iron. Other fences may be of any
material or style.
(3) Electrified fences, razor wire and barbed wire are prohibited.
(4) In all districts the finished side of the fence shall face the
neighboring property.
F. Lighting.
(1) All streets, alleys, sidewalks, pedestrianways and parking facilities
shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property
and the safety of persons.
(2) All entrances and exits in buildings used for nonresidential
purposes or containing two or more dwelling units shall be
adequately lighted.
G. Location of utility wires, boxes, meters, panels, devices and other
similar equipment and installations. [Amended 12-15-2015]
§ 223-11 UNION CITY CODE § 223-11
1:420
(1) All electric power, telephone, cable television, Internet and other
utility lines serving new development, other than an individual oneto
three-family home shall be placed underground, subject to utility
company requirements.
(2) Electric power, telephone, cable television, Internet, gas and other
utility boxes, meters, panels, devices and similar equipment and
installations shall not be constructed, placed and/or relocated to
the portion(s) of any structure that is located adjacent to a street or
roadway.
H. Lots.
(1) Each lot must front upon an approved street. No lot shall front on
an alley.
(2) Lots shall be rectangular insofar as practical. Side lot lines should
be at right angles to straight streets and radial to curved streets.
Rear lot lines should be parallel to streets.
(3) Lot lines bordering streets shall be coterminous with the street
right-of-way.
I. Low-rise and mid-rise apartment buildings.
(1) Building design and articulation.
(a) All multifamily structures shall be situated with proper
consideration of their relationship to other buildings, both
existing and proposed, in terms of light, air and usable open
spaces, access to public rights-of-way and off street parking,
height and bulk.
(b) Groups of related buildings including low-rise and mid-rise
apartments, along with architectural focal points, shall be
designed to present a harmonious appearance in terms of
building silhouette, architectural style and scale; massing of
building form; surface material, finish and texture; decorative
features; window and doorway proportions, entryway
placement and location, signage and landscaping.
(c) Efforts to coordinate the actual and apparent height of
adjacent structures are encouraged. This is especially
applicable where buildings are located very close to each
other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice
or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building. Similar
design linkages can be achieved to adjust apparent height by
placing window lines, belt courses, and other horizontal
elements in a pattern that reflects the same elements on
neighboring buildings.
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:421
(d) Large structures should be designed to reduce their perceived
height and bulk by dividing the building mass into smallerscale
components.
(e) Projects should be compatible with the scale of development
anticipated by the applicable land use policies for the
surrounding area and should be sited and designed to provide
a sensitive transition to nearby, less-intensive zones. Projects
on zone edges should be developed in a manner that creates a
step in perceived height, bulk and scale between the project
and development in adjacent zones.
(f) Multiple buildings on the same site shall be designed to create
a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings.
(2) Bay spacing and differentiation.
(a) All street-facing building facades longer than 50 feet shall be
broken up into smaller bays so as to give the appearance of a
series of different buildings rather than a large building mass.
(b) The design and dimensions of bays along one building facade
should create a varied articulation; a monotonous repetition of
bays along a very long facade should be avoided.
(3) Vertical differentiation for mid-rise apartment buildings.
(a) All mid-rise apartment buildings shall be articulated with a
base, middle and top. This breaks down the scale of tall
buildings while maintaining a pedestrian-friendly environment
along the streets.
(b) Base. The base is the lower one or two levels of a building. To
define a base in residential buildings, unique materials and
window pattern and proportion are encouraged. A base of
bulkhead area of contrasting material is encouraged in order
to highlight the first level.
(c) Middle. The middle of the building should be distinguished
from the top and the base by horizontal belt courses or trim
cornices, stepbacks, and setback changes in material, masonry
or fenestration pattern; and/or other appropriate means.
(d) Top and roof. Depending on the height and design of the
building, the top of the building may be just the roofline or the
top one or two floors. The roofline should relate to the bay
massing so as to appear as a series of side-by-side buildings.
Rooflines should be emphasized for example by variation in
roof forms such flat roofs, with parapets and/or cornices. Flat
roof areas can serve as landscaped roof decks for adjacent
units or for the entire building or may be used as green roofs.
(4) Building entries.
§ 223-11 UNION CITY CODE § 223-11
1:422
(a) Primary pedestrian entrances should be sited to face, frame
and open onto the interior streets, required open spaces and
community facilities rather than alleys, driveways and parking
lots.
(b) Provisions shall be made in any low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise
apartment structure to provide access for the handicapped,
pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act.
(5) Building stepbacks. Building stepbacks are an effective design
strategy to reduce the overall mass and appearance of mid-rise and
high-rise buildings and to create valuable private spaces such as
terraces on upper stories. To achieve this design strategy, the
following is required:
(a) Buildings taller than three stories shall provide front-facade
and/or side-facade stepback or other change in massing at
upper floors in order to downplay their mass and visibility.
(b) Stepbacks are measured with respect to lower-level facades
and not property lines.
(c) One front-facade stepback or change in massing of at least five
feet shall be provided, beginning at the fourth floor for mid-rise
buildings. Other options include varying heights of facades,
cornices or parapet lines to emphasize the top of the third story
in a mid-rise building and arrangements of window lines, belt
courses, and other horizontal elements in a pattern that
reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings. Other
techniques are possible, and use of more than one technique is
encouraged.
(d) The following regulations apply to all multifamily residential
buildings and refer to stepbacks along the side facades, thus
reducing the overall scale and mass of building facades:
[1] No stepbacks are required for building stories one through
three.
[2] In a mid-rise building, for stories four, five and six, where
applicable, building facades shall stepback a minimum of
15% of the building footprint at the fifth floor.
[3] Stepbacks are not required on facades that do not face a
public street. For example stepbacks are not required on
internal lot lines or on rear facades.
(6) Rooftop mechanical equipment.
(a) All mechanical equipment shall be adequately screened from
view from properties directly adjacent to the property line.
This may be achieved in a variety of ways including using
landscaping, decorative walls, and decorative fencing.
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:423
(b) All rooftop mechanical equipment shall be set back at least 10
feet from the upper-level building facades and be setback far
enough that it is not visible from public rights-of-way.
(c) All rooftop equipment shall be screened from view in a manner
consistent with the architectural design and materials of the
buildings.
(7) Building transparency.
(a) Principal entries shall be visible and easily identifiable and
highlighted by prominent architectural features.
(b) Secondary entrances should be clearly designed as secondary
in importance with the overall facade requirements.
(c) Service entrances shall face parking lots or driveways and be
placed at the rear and not facing streets or other public spaces.
(d) All residential multifamily buildings shall have primary entry
hall or lobby area connected to the sidewalk via a pedestrian
walkway. Individual entries for ground-floor units are
encouraged as well.
(e) Secondary entries also shall be connected to the sidewalk by
pedestrian paths and should be clearly designed to be
secondary in importance in the overall facade arrangement.
(8) Ground-floor elevations.
(a) For all residential buildings, it is important to balance the need
to provide a sense of privacy and separation for first-floor units
with the need to provide transparency and a relationship to the
street and the sidewalk.
(b) Common building entrances shall be located at grade. The
finished floor elevations of ground-floor units should be raised
at least several steps above grade but shall not be more than
four feet above sidewalk grade.
(9) Windows.
(a) Window size and proportion are allowed to vary in order to
complement a variety of building styles.
(b) Residential windows.
[1] For ground level residential and parking areas disguised
with architectural detailing, windows shall be provided,
occupying at least 35% of the facade area.
[2] At least 25% of the facade area of upper-level residential
floors shall be glazed with transparent windows.
§ 223-11 UNION CITY CODE § 223-11
1:424
(c) Blank walls are prohibited for all buildings, except where
Building or Fire Codes prohibit windows or doors.
(10) Common elements.
(a) The developer shall submit proposals for ownership and
maintenance of common elements, including open space,
recreation facilities, meeting rooms, parking areas, driveways,
private streets and similar facilities. The proposal shall be
reviewed and approved by the approving authority as a
condition of preliminary site plan approval.
(b) Apartment buildings with 50 or more dwelling units shall
provide on-site amenities for residents, which may include
open space, recreation facilities and/or meeting rooms.
(c) All mid-rise and high-rise apartment buildings shall provide an
indoor refuse and recycling storage area.
(11) Parking design.
(a) As part of the goal of encouraging pedestrian-friendly design,
the visibility of off-street parking areas from streets, sidewalks,
open spaces and other public spaces shall be minimized.
(b) On-site parking areas and streets shall be paved with asphalt
and curbed with concrete or granite block as approved by the
enforcing agency.
(c) Structured parking is permitted on the first, second and third
levels of buildings and is the preferred solution; provided that
such parking is hidden from direct view of streets, open spaces
and other public areas by being located behind residential and
common lobby spaces.
(d) The rear parking facades can be screened architecturally as
described below:
[1] Parking garage facades shall be architecturally screened
to harmonize with the building;
[2] The facades shall be architecturally integrated with the
building facade both vertically and horizontally. Parking
facades shall be broken into bays and fenestration
patterns similar to the rest of the building mass; and
[3] Articulation of bays for the rear structured parking facade
may begin above the second floor, creating a podium or
terrace above the parking area.
[4] Exposed parking structures below buildings supported by
columns or "pilotis" are not permitted.
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:425
(e) Garage doors may not exceed 20 feet in width and garage curb
cuts shall not exceed 24 feet in width.
(f) Off-street surface parking lots shall be located to the rear of
the residential buildings and away from direct view of streets.
(g) All parking areas shall be adequately screened to prevent
impacts on adjacent properties and streets, as required by

(a) All commercial floor space provided on the ground floor of a
mixed-use building must have a minimum floor-to-ceiling
height of 11 feet.
(b) Transparency.
[1] A minimum of 70% of the street-facing building facade
between two feet and eight feet in height must be
comprised of clear windows that allow views of indoor
space or product display areas. Ground floor windows for
§ 223-11 UNION CITY CODE § 223-11
1:426
office buildings shall be designed similarly to retail
windows so as to allow flexibility for future change in use
to retail.
[2] The bottom of any window or product display window used
to satisfy the transparency standard referenced above may
not be more than four feet above the adjacent sidewalk.
[3] Product display windows used to satisfy these
requirements must be internally lighted.
(c) Doors and entrances.

or businesses, lobby entrances, entrances to pedestrianoriented
plazas, or courtyard entrances to a cluster of
shops or businesses.
(3) Except for all applicable requirements in Subsection J(1) and (2)
above, mixed-use buildings shall also meet the building design
standards found within § 223-11I.
K. Refuse and recycling facilities.
(1) Outdoor refuse and recycling containers shall be visually screened
within a durable enclosure, so as not to be visible from adjacent lots
or sites, neighboring properties or streets.
(2) All materials or wastes which might cause fumes, dust, odor or

(e) One-way street with angled parking on both sides: 55 feet.
(f) Two-way street with angled parking on both sides: 60 feet.
(g) One-way alley: nine feet.
(h) Two-way alley: 18 feet.
(8) Intersections.
(a) Offset. New intersections along one side of an existing street
should coincide with existing intersections on the other side of
the same street. Where intersections do not coincide, the
minimum offset between two intersections shall be 150 feet for
the intersection of two streets and 100 feet for the intersection
of a street and an alley.
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:431
§ 223-12. Construction requirements.
(b) Curb return radius. In general, the curb return radius at
intersections should be 15 feet. A smaller or larger curb return
radius may be permitted where appropriate. Smaller curb
return radii induce slower vehicle turning movements and are
safer for pedestrians, while larger curb return radii may be
necessary to allow for turning movements by large vehicles
such as buses and trucks.
(9) Curves. Streets should be straight whenever possible to conform to
the City's historic grid pattern. Where curved streets are necessary,
they should be designed in a manner that conforms with current
engineering practices for the volume of traffic they are expected to
carry and that is acceptable to the enforcing agency.
(10) Drainage. All streets and alleys shall have curb and gutter on both
sides that meet the requirements of § 223-11D. Pedestrianways
shall provide for curb and gutter or natural drainage, as
appropriate.
(11) Sidewalks. All streets shall have sidewalks and street trees on both
sides that meet the requirements of § 223-11M. Sidewalks and
street trees are not required for alleys.
(12) Grading, pavement and subgrade of streets, alleys and
pedestrianways shall be constructed to standards that conform to
current engineering practices for the volume of traffic they are
expected to carry and that are acceptable to the enforcing agency.
Alleys should be paved with materials such as cobbles that are
designed to slow traffic. The approving authority may also require
the use of such materials in portions of streets, at crosswalks and/
or at intersections where needed to slow traffic.
A. City standards. All standards and specifications of the City as now or
hereafter adopted, if any, shall govern the design, construction and
installation of all required improvements. Failure of the developer, his
contractor or agent to conform to said specifications shall be just cause
for the suspension of the work being performed, in accordance with the
Uniform Construction Code. No developer shall have the right to
demand or claim damages from the City, its officers, agents or servants
by reason of said suspension.
B. Other standards. In the event that the City has not adopted standards
for a specific type of improvement, then generally accepted engineering
standards, as set forth in current engineering and construction manuals
as may be approved and modified by the enforcing agency for a specific
situation, shall be used.
C. Grades. All construction stakes and grades shall be set by or under the
supervision of a licensed land surveyor. One copy of all cut sheets shall
§ 223-11 UNION CITY CODE § 223-12
1:432
be filed with the enforcing agency prior to the commencement of any
construction.
D. Approved plans. Prior to commencement of construction of required
improvements, the enforcing agency shall have received and approved
the complete plans and profiles of all improvements to be installed or
constructed. No improvements shall be accepted by the governing body
and no performance guaranties released until the enforcing agency has
received and approved drawings showing the plans, grades and profiles
of all improvements as finally constructed. Plans approved by the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be signed and
dated by the Board's Chairman and Secretary.
E. Site conditions. During construction, the site shall be maintained and
left each day in a safe, clean and orderly manner, and any condition
which could lead to personal injury or property damage shall be
immediately corrected by the developer or upon an order by the
Construction Code Official or other authorized personnel.
F. Disposal of dead trees, litter, building materials. All stumps, litter,
rubbish, brush, weeds, dead and dying trees, debris and excess or scrap
building materials shall be removed or destroyed immediately upon the
request of and to the satisfaction of the Construction Code Official prior
to issuing an occupancy permit. No such refuse shall be buried on the
site.
G. Changes in elevation.
(1) No change shall be made in the elevation or contour of any lot or
site by the removal of earth to another lot or site other than as
shown on an approved preliminary plan.
(2) Minimal changes in elevation or contours necessitated by field
conditions may be made only after approval by the enforcing
agency. All said changes shall be shown on the final plan and
indicated as a change from the preliminary, or if final approval has
been granted, all changes shall be shown on the as-built plans.
H. Excavations. No excavation shall be created or maintained, except
when required for the foundations of structures or in connection with
and during the installation of facilities for permitted uses. Such
excavation shall be used for the intended purpose or shall be refilled to
the average surrounding ground level, in such a manner as to prevent
the collection of water, erosion of earth or collapse or sliding of banks,
within six months from the date of commencement of such excavation.
I. Topsoil removal. The applicant shall obtain all necessary permits.
J. Preconstruction meeting. Prior to the commencement of construction,
the developer shall arrange for and attend a preconstruction meeting in
conformance with the requirements of the enforcing agency.
§ 223-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-12
1:433
§ 223-13. Improvements.
Prior to the granting of final approval, the applicant shall have installed
or constructed improvements required by the approving authority or have
posted a performance guaranty or surety sufficient to cover the costs of
said improvements. The approving authority may solicit local, county, state,
federal, public or semipublic agencies and knowledgeable individuals on
what improvements shall be required. Improvements recommended by
other agencies, such as a utilities authority, county, state or other
governmental agencies, may be required by the approving authority as a
condition of final approval.
K. Prohibited materials. [Added 1-20-2015 by Ord. No. 012015;
amended 12-15-2015]
(1) The following four construction materials, and any other similar or
like materials, are specifically prohibited for all new construction of
a building facade or other street frontage:
(a) Thin brick;
(b) Tile;
(c) Synthetic stucco; and
(d) Hardy planks.
(2) This subsection is applicable on new construction only.

ARTICLE IV
Development Review Procedures and Plat Details
§ 223-14. Regulation of land development.
Regulation of land development and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to development applications is an exercise of valid police power
delegated by the state to the City. The applicant shall comply with
reasonable conditions laid down by the approving authority for design,
dedication, improvements, and the use of the land to conform to the
physical and economical development of the municipality and to the safety
and general welfare of the future residents and owners in the development
and the community at large.
§ 223-15. County Planning Board report.
Where County Planning Board review or approval is required on a
subdivision or site plan, the approving authority shall condition any
approval it grants upon either timely receipt of a favorable report by the
County Planning Board or approval by the County Planning Board due
to its failure to submit a report within the required time period. If the
county's report is negative or attaches conditions, the original action by the
municipal approving authority shall be null and void, and a new resolution
shall be adopted which considers the County Planning Board's report.
§ 223-16. Granting of exceptions.
The approving authority, when acting upon applications for preliminary or
minor subdivision approval and preliminary site plan approval, shall have
the power to grant such exceptions from the development requirements and
standards in Article III of this chapter as may be reasonable and within the
general purpose and intent of the provisions for subdivision or site plan
review and approval if the literal enforcement of one or more provisions
of this chapter is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question. Exceptions from
N.J.A.C. 5:21, Residential Site Improvement Standards, as adopted and
amended, may be granted consistent with RSIS requirements.
§ 223-17. Exemptions from subdivision regulations.
Divisions of land not considered a subdivision as defined in the Municipal
Land Use Law shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements
of this chapter. Unless exempted from the subdivision regulations by the
approving authority, no person can transfer, sell, or agree to transfer or sell,
as owner or agent, any land which forms a part of subdivision for which
approval is required.
§ 223-18. Simultaneous review.
The approving authority shall have the power to act upon subdivisions,
conditional uses or site plans simultaneously without the developer making
§ 223-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-18
1:435
further application or the approving authority holding further hearings. The
longest time period for action by the approving authority, whether it be
for subdivision, conditional use or site plan approval, shall apply. Whenever
approval of a conditional use is requested by the developer in conjunction
with a site plan or subdivision, notice of the hearing on the plat shall include
reference to the request for such conditional use.
§ 223-19. Site plan approval required.
A site plan approval is required for all developments which do not meet the
definition of "site plan, exempt."
§ 223-20. Submission of concept plan for minor and major
developments.
§ 223-21. Submission of preliminary plat for major developments.
A. Submittal of a concept plan is optional. Any applicant may be placed on
the agenda of a regular meeting of the Planning Board for discussion on
an informally prepared plat. The purpose will be to review concepts to
assist the applicant in the preparation of subsequent plans. Other than
classification, no decisions will be made, no hearings held, and no
formal action taken on an informal plat.

at least 21 days prior to the meeting of the approving authority 14
copies of the informal plat, a narrative description of the proposal by
the developer, and the applicable fee and escrow amounts. In
accordance with the Municipal Land Use Law, the fee charged for
informal review shall be credited toward the fee for preliminary review
at the time of preliminary submission.
C. Action by the approving authority. The approving authority shall hear
the application at a public meeting and, if appropriate, shall determine
whether the application is to be classified as a major or minor
development and shall render such additional advice as to the
approvals or variances required as a part of the review process.
Discussion on the substantive aspects of the application shall not be
binding on either the applicant or the approving authority.
A. Filing procedure.

set and notice given. The applicant shall be responsible for
providing public notice as required by law.
(3) Upon submission of a plat, the administrative officer shall submit
one copy of the plat and supporting data to the enforcing agency,
and any other agency or person as directed by the approving
authority for their review and action. Each shall have not more than
30 days from receipt of the plat to report to the approving
authority. In the event of disapproval, such report shall state the
reasons therefor. If any agency or person fails to report to the
approving authority within the designated period, said plat shall be
deemed to have been approved by them.
(4) Preliminary approval of a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots shall be
granted or denied within 45 days of the date of a complete
submission or within such further time as may be consented to by
§ 223-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-21
1:437
the developer. Otherwise, the approving authority shall be deemed
to have granted preliminary approval to the subdivision.
(5) The approving authority shall grant or deny preliminary site plan

a complete submission.
(6) If the approving authority requires any substantial amendment in
the layout of improvements in either a site plan or subdivision as
proposed by the developer, and that plan has been the subject of a
hearing, an amended application for development shall be
submitted and proceeded upon as in the case of the original
application for development. The approving authority shall, if the
proposed development complies with this chapter, grant
preliminary approval.
(7) The approving authority may approve, disapprove, or approve with
conditions the application. The decision shall be in writing and
shall be sent to the applicant and the newspaper as required by the
Municipal Land Use Law. If the approving authority grants
preliminary approval, its Chairman and Secretary (or the Vice
Chairman or Assistant Secretary in their absence, respectively)
shall sign each page of the plat indicating approval. If the plat is
conditionally approved, it shall not be signed until all conditions are
complied with; if all conditions are not complied with within 90
days from the date of the meeting at which a plat was conditionally
approved, the conditional approval shall lapse.
(8) Preliminary approval shall, except as provided in Subsection
B(8)(a) below, confer upon the applicant the following rights for a
three-year period from the date of the preliminary approval:
(a) That the general terms and conditions on which preliminary
approval was granted shall not be changed, including but not
limited to, use requirements; layout and design standards for
streets, curbs and sidewalks; lot size; yard dimensions and offtract

extension of two years, provided that if the design standards
have been revised by ordinance such revised standards may
govern.
(d) In the case of a development for an area of 50 acres or more,
the approving authority may grant the rights referred to in
Subsection B(8)(a), (b) and (c) above for such period of time,
longer than three years, as shall be determined by the
approving authority to be reasonable taking into consideration
1) the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area
permissible under preliminary approval; 2) the potential
number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area of the
section(s) awaiting final approval; 3) economic conditions; and
4) the comprehensiveness of the development, provided that, if
the design standards have been revised, such revised
standards may govern.

(2) Additional requirements may be contained within the relevant
checklists for development applications.
(3) Where utility services are to be extended to a property or into the
tract, the final plat shall be accompanied by letters directed to the
Chairman of the approving authority and signed by a responsible
officer of the water company, sewer authority, and utility which
provides gas, telephone and electricity that has jurisdiction in the
area. Such letters shall approve each proposed utility installation
design and state who will construct the facility.
(4) The final plat shall be accompanied by a statement by the enforcing
agency acknowledging receipt of a map showing all utilities and
other improvements (both in the development and off-tract
improvements) in exact location and elevation; that the Engineer
has examined the drainage, erosion, stormwater control, and
excavation plans and found that the interests of the City and all
nearby properties are fully protected; identifying those portions of
any improvements already installed; and that the developer has
either:
(a) Installed all improvements in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and the preliminary plat approval
with a maintenance guarantee accompanying the final plat; or
(b) Posted a performance guarantee that has been approved by the
enforcing agency.
B. Actions following filing.
(1) The approving authority shall grant final approval if the detailed
drawings, specifications and estimates conform to the standards
established by this chapter, the conditions of preliminary approval,
and the standards prescribed by the Map Filing Law, N.J.S.A.
46:26A, B and C. Deviations from preliminary approval that are

Assistant Secretary in their absence, respectively). Failure of the
§ 223-22 UNION CITY CODE § 223-22
1:440
approving authority to act within the period prescribed shall
constitute final approval, and a certificate of the administrative
officer as to the failure of the approving authority to act shall
be issued on request of the applicant. Such certificate shall be
sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of
approval herein required and shall be so accepted by the county
recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats.
(3) Whenever review or approval of the application by the County
Planning Board is required by Section 5 of P.L. 1968, c. 285
(N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3) or Section 8 of P.L. 1968, c. 285 (N.J.S.A.

the Map Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c. 141 (N.J.S.A. 46:26A, B and C), or
a deed clearly describing the approved minor subdivision is filed by
the developer with the county recording officer, the City Engineer
and the City Tax Assessor. Such plat or deed accepted for such
filing shall have been signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the
approving authority (or the Vice Chairman or Assistant Secretary in
their absence, respectively). In reviewing the application for
development for a proposed minor subdivision the approving
authority may accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing
Law, provided that if the developer chooses to file the minor
subdivision by plat rather than deed, such plat shall conform with
the provisions of said law.
(5) Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from the
date of signing of the plat unless within such period the plat shall
have been duly filed by the developer with the county recording
officer. The approving authority may for good cause shown extend
the period for recording for an additional period not to exceed 190
days from the date of signing of the plat. No subdivision plat shall
be accepted for filing by the county recording officer until it has
been approved by the approving authority as indicated on the
instrument by the signature of the Chairman and Secretary of the
approving authority (or the Vice Chairman or Assistant Secretary in
their absence, respectively) or a certificate has been issued as to
the failure of the approving authority to act within the required
time. The signatures of the Chairman and Secretary shall not be
affixed until the developer has posted the required guarantees. If
the county recording officer records any plat without such
approval, such recording shall be deemed null and void, and upon
request of the municipality, the plat shall be expunged from the
§ 223-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-22
1:441
§ 223-23. Plat design standards for subdivisions.
official records. It shall be the duty of the county recording officer
to notify the Planning Board in writing within seven days of the
filing of any plat, identifying such instrument by its title, date of
filing, and official number.
(6) Provided the approved final subdivision plat has been filed with the
county recording officer, the zoning requirements applicable to the
preliminary approval first granted to a site plan or a major
subdivision and all other rights conferred upon the developer
pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law, whether conditionally or
otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of two years after the
case of final approval. If the developer has followed the standards
prescribed for final approval, the approving authority may extend
such period of protection for extensions of one year, but not to
exceed three extensions. Upon granting of final approval, the rights
conferred upon the applicant by the granting of preliminary
approval shall be terminated.
(7) Provided the approved final plat of a minor subdivision has been
filed with the county recording officer, the zoning requirements and
general terms and conditions, whether conditional or otherwise,
upon which minor subdivision approval was granted, shall not be
changed for a period of two years after the date of subdivision
approval.
(8) The developer shall submit three copies of the approved final plat
to the administrative officer for distribution and shall supply one
translucent cloth or Mylar copy to the administrative officer.
A. Plat conformity. No development application shall be accepted unless
submitted in plat form and no plat, other than an informal plat as set
forth in this article, shall be accepted for consideration unless it

(1) Purpose. The purpose of the Historic Preservation Overlay District
is to provide additional protection to the Monastery of the
Perpetual Rosary (the "Blue Chapel") and the Monastery and
Church of Saint Michael the Archangel historic sites and the
existing residential areas surrounding them by preventing the
intrusion of incompatible uses into the neighborhoods and by
maintaining existing development intensity and population density

K. JFK Boulevard Design Overlay District.
(1) Purpose. Areas along John F. Kennedy Boulevard outside of the
commercial core are predominantly nonresidentially zoned. From a
planning perspective, there is concern over the future layout and
scale of development within these areas. It is the intent to preserve,
enhance and improve the existing layout of development. The
overlay district establishes design guidelines and standards for
yards, open space, landscaping, signage, setbacks, connectivity,
and screening. The standards are the basis for development design
in the overlay district unless the requirement of the underlying
zone district standard is more restrictive. In such cases, the more
restrictive standard would govern.
(2) Applicability.
(a) The bulk and design requirements of the overlay zone apply to
all new nonresidential development, expansions, or
redevelopment, except for smaller additions or modification to
an existing use. This exception permits any existing lot in the
§ 223-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-42
1:473
commercial overlay zone on which a building or structure
is located to have additions to the principal building and/or
construction of any accessory building or structures without a
variance from the overlay zone standards and requirements.
An expansion or modification shall meet the following to
qualify for the exception from the overlay zone requirements:
[1] There is no change in the use of the lot or principal
building.
[2] The expansion conforms to the requirements of the
underlying zone district.
[3] The building additions do not cumulatively exceed 1,000
square feet of gross floor area.
[4] The development does not disturb more than 5,000 square
feet of ground area.
(b) All residential uses in residential districts shall be governed by
the existing underlying district standards.
(3) Yards, open space, and landscaping.
(a) Off-street parking and loading areas shall not be permitted in
the required front yard setback.
(b) Aboveground detention basins are not permitted in the front
yard area.
(c) A ten-foot buffer shall be located within the minimum yard
setbacks when a nonresidential use adjoins a residential use.
Buffer areas should be located entirely within the property of
the nonresidential use along the edge of parking lots and
property lines that abut residentially zoned lots or uses to
prevent any and all reflection of lights and to prevent
windblown or other debris from being blown or transported to
or be visible from the adjacent or neighboring residential
premises. Buffering should be designed to reduce the impacts
of noise and movement of people and vehicles and to shield
activities from adjacent properties and nearby roadways.
Buffering should consist of fencing, landscaped berms,
evergreens, shrubs, bushes, deciduous trees, plants, or a
combination thereof, and should be installed to have an
immediate positive impact.
(d) A five-foot wide grass/landscaped area shall be established and
maintained along the John F. Kennedy Boulevard roadway
frontage.
(e) Landscaping shall be incorporated at the base of freestanding
signs. A minimum depth of 36 inches should be incorporated
§ 223-42 UNION CITY CODE § 223-42
1:474
around the base of the sign to include low-growing shrubs and
ground cover and/or flowering annuals to promote color.
(4) Connectivity between sites. A system of joint-use driveways and
cross-access easements shall be established wherever feasible
along the building site and shall incorporate the following:
(a) A continuous service drive or cross access extending the entire
length of each parcel served to provide for driveway separation
consistent with access management classification system
standards;
(b) Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious
that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross
access via a service drive; and
(c) A unified access and circulation system plan that includes
coordinated or shared parking areas is encouraged.
L. PPOD Palisades Preservation Overlay District.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to provide for
reasonable control of development within areas of steep slopes
along the Palisades in the City of Union City. The regulations of this
overlay district are intended to minimize the adverse impact
caused by the development of such areas, including, but not limited
to, erosion, siltation, flooding and surface water runoff. The
disturbance of soil and construction and development on steep
slopes and cliff faces creates an additional hazard to the lives and
property of those dwelling on the slopes and below them. The most
appropriate method of alleviating such conditions is through the
regulation of such vegetation and soil disturbances, construction
and development. Therefore, it is determined that the special and
paramount public interest in these slopes justifies the regulation of
property located thereon as provided below, which is the exercise
of the police power by the City for the protection of persons and the
property of its inhabitants and for the preservation of the public
health, safety and general welfare.
(2) Establishment of district.
(a) There is hereby established within the City of Union City an
area which shall be known as the Palisades Preservation
Overlay District (PPOD), in which land development and
construction shall be subject to the special regulations
contained in this section.
(b) The PPOD shall be designated on the Zoning Map of the City of
Union City and shall run along the Palisades from 20th Street
to the Jersey City boundary line.
§ 223-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-42
1:475
(c) The PPOD shall prevail upon all land regulated under this
chapter, as well as those properties within a duly adopted
redevelopment area.
(d) All uses permitted in the zone shall meet all setback
regulations and performance standards. This provision shall
apply to any use permitted by right, by conditional use or by
use variance.
(3) Applicability.
(a) Applicants for site plan or subdivision approval shall submit all
information required under this section to the appropriate
approving authority.
(b) Applicants for construction permits, including the construction
of buildings, walls, driveways or other structures or the
clearing of land shall submit an application with the
information required in this section to the City Building
Department whenever development is proposed within the
Palisades Preservation Overlay District to ensure that the
proposed development of the lot will respect the natural
features of the tract and minimize adverse impacts associated
with such clearing and/or construction.
(4) Procedural regulations. The following information shall be
submitted in addition to any information required to be submitted
for site plan and subdivision applications as required in Article IV:
(a) A topographic map of the site at two-foot contour intervals
(drawn in a lighter line weight) where the slope is less than
10%, and ten-foot contour intervals (drawn in a heavier line
weight) where the slope exceeds 10%.
(b) A land form analysis which shows the location and extent of the
site's major landforms, including the top of the cliff, the cliff
face, the side slope and the base of the slope. Any exposed cliff
face shall be shown. The area in each land form category shall
be calculated and shown on the land form analysis.
(c) A physical description of the site which shall include a
technical summary of site characteristics such as soils, loadbearing
capacity, erosion potential, depth to bedrock, etc.
(d) Site grading and development data which shall include the
type and location of development activity, procedures for
grading, excavation, construction access and stockpiling,
extent and phasing of construction and cut and fill operations.
(5) Permitted uses and bulk. The uses permitted in underlying zoning
districts shall be permitted in the PPOD. The applicable bulk
standards for the underlying zones shall apply, as modified by the
§ 223-42 UNION CITY CODE § 223-42
1:476
regulations of the PPOD. The standards of the PPOD are the basis
for development design in the overlay zone unless the requirement
of the underlying zone district standard is more restrictive. In such
cases, the more restrictive standard would govern.
(6) Permitted limit of disturbance.
(a) The minimum building setback line from the edge of the cliff
face at the top of the cliff shall be 30 feet. The minimum

of submission of a completed application.
M. UTOD Uptown Transit Oriented Development Overlay District.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of the Uptown Transit Oriented Development
(UTOD) Overlay District is to offer incentives to encourage
property owners to develop their properties using transit-oriented
design principles while preserving rights permitted by underlying
district designations. The UTOD Overlay District is established to:
(a) Promote new, well-integrated residential, commercial, office,
institutional and other employment center development close
to the light rail transit station, while protecting and enhancing
existing development;
(b) Ensure that new development takes advantage of compatible,
higher density, transit-friendly design opportunities in close
proximity to transit systems in order to provide options for
economic development;
(c) Manage parking and vehicular access utilizing shared parking
and driveway access to avoid pedestrian conflicts; and
(d) Encourage, through design, configuration, and mix of buildings
and activities, a pedestrian-oriented environment which
provides settings for social interaction and active community
life.
(2) Applicability. To implement the UTOD in a manner consistent with
its stated purpose, the district shall serve as an overlay zone, or
optional development alternative, to the existing underlying zoning
districts as specified on the City's Zoning Map. If a developer/
redeveloper chooses the UTOD overlay option, the standards and
requirements, including permitted uses, described in this chapter
shall apply. Although the underlying zoning remains in place, the
UTOD District designation encourages mixed-use development
close to mass transit systems while enhancing and complementing
existing and adjacent development. An applicant must follow the
provisions of either of the underlying district or the UTOD District.
(3) Permitted principal uses.

with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the
area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical
sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such signs faces
are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches

agreement is no longer in force, parking shall be provided as
otherwise required in this chapter.
(c) Shared parking for uses with different hours of operation.
Shared parking shall be permitted between two uses with
differing hours of operation, provided that the approving
authority shall have discretion in determining which uses are
daytime uses and which are nighttime or Sunday uses. The
following shall serve as general guidelines:
§ 223-46 UNION CITY CODE § 223-46
1:514
[1] The following uses may be generally considered daytime
uses:
[a] Offices.
[b] Retail sales and services, except restaurants, bars and
entertainment uses.
[c] Wholesale, storage and distribution uses.
[d] Manufacturing uses.
[e] Other similar primarily daytime uses as determined by
the approving authority.
[2] The following uses may be generally considered nighttime
or Sunday uses:
[a] Places of worship, clubhouses, and theaters.
[b] Bars.
[c] Other similar primarily nighttime or Sunday uses as
determined by the approving authority.
(d) The approving authority may authorize the use of up to 90% of
the required off-street parking for a daytime use to serve as the
required off-street parking for a nighttime or Sunday use and
vice versa. The applicant shall demonstrate that the hours of
operation of the two uses will not conflict, and the approving
authority shall place conditions limiting the hours of operation
to ensure that adequate parking is available to all users at the
appropriate times.
(e) Shared parking for uses with similar hours of operation. The
approving authority may approve shared parking
arrangements between two or more uses with the same or
overlapping operating hours by up to 20% of the total parking
that would be required for all of the uses calculated separately.
(f) In all shared parking situations, the approving authority may
require that an applicant for shared parking provide testimony
and/or a shared parking feasibility study in support of the
application from a licensed engineer in the State of New Jersey
with expertise in parking operations. A shared parking
feasibility report shall include, but is not limited to, the
following:
[1] A site plan sheet depicting the parking spaces intended for
shared parking and their proximity to land uses they will
serve.
§ 223-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-46
1:515
§ 223-47. Nonconforming uses, structures and lots.
[2] A signage plan that directs drivers to the most convenient
parking areas for each particular use or group of uses as
appropriate.
[3] A pedestrian circulation plan that shows connections and
walkways between parking areas and land uses.
[4] A safety and security plan that addresses lighting and
maintenance of the parking areas.
C. Off-street loading.
(1) Application. In any building or building group or part thereof
hereafter erected and having a gross floor area of 20,000 square
feet or more of nonresidential space, there shall be provided and
maintained on the same zone lot with such building, off-street
loading berths.
(2) Required off-street loading facilities.
(a) No off-street loading spaces shall be required for buildings
located within the C-C, C-G, C-N and UTOD Districts, except
that loading spaces shall be required within the JFK Overlay
District.
(b) No off-street loading spaces shall be required for
nonresidential uses located on lots that are 2,500 square feet
or smaller.
(c) Location of loading berths. All loading areas shall be on the
same lot as the use to be served. Such areas shall be located
only in a side or rear yard. Such areas shall not encroach upon
any required open space, accessway, off-street parking area or
public right-of-way. Where located adjacent to any residential
district, they shall be set back a minimum of five feet from such
property line.
(d) Access. All required off-street loading areas shall provide
sufficient turning spaces and access.
(e) Calculation of required spaces. The number of off-street
loading berths required for any use shall be determined by
application of the standards set forth below:
Principal Building Size
(square feet)
Required Number of
Loading Berths
Up to 20,000 1
20,000 to 50,000 2

A. Nonconforming buildings or structures. A building or structure that is
conforming in use but does not conform to the lot dimension, yard
dimension, height, building coverage, floor area ratio, off-street
parking, loading, or similar dimensional requirements of the chapter
shall be deemed to be a nonconforming building or nonconforming
structure. No permit shall be issued that will result in the increase of
any dimensional nonconformity, but any building or structure or portion
thereof may be altered to decrease its dimensional nonconformity.
B. Continuance of existing nonconforming uses and structures. Any
nonconforming use or structure which lawfully existed at the time of
the passage of this article may be continued, and any existing legally
nonconforming building or structure may be reconstructed or
structurally altered, but only in accordance with the requirements of
this article.
C. Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use ceases
for any reason for a period of 12 consecutive months, or is changed to a
conforming use, any future use of the land, building or structure shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Substantial
cessation of activities consistent with or required for the operation of
such nonconforming use or substantial vacancy of the building or
structure in which the nonconforming use was conducted, together
with substantial cessation of activities consistent with or required for
the operation of such nonconforming use shall be deemed to constitute
a discontinuation thereof within the meaning of this chapter,
irrespective of whether an intention to abandon the nonconforming use
may exist. On application, prior to the expiration of the twelve-month
period as specified herein, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may extend
the period for up to six additional months upon a finding that it is not
reasonable in its application to the particular premises, taking into
consideration the characteristics of the use, the investment which has
been made in it, the circumstances of the discontinuance and the
suitability of the building or structure for a permitted use or a use
granted by special use permit. If any building or structure in which any
nonconforming use is conducted or maintained is hereafter removed,
the subsequent use of the land on which such building or structure was
located and the subsequent use of any building or structure thereon
shall be in conformity with the standards specified by this chapter for
the district in which such land is located.
D. Alteration, extension or enlargement of nonconforming use or
structure.
(1) A nonconforming use of any building, structure or land shall not be
increased, enlarged, extended or changed in any manner
whatsoever.
(2) No building in which a nonconforming use exists shall be enlarged,
extended or structurally altered in any manner; provided, however,
that:
§ 223-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-47
1:517
(a) Nothing herein shall prevent the repair and maintenance of
any building wherein there exists a nonconforming use,
provided that such maintenance and repair does not in any way
constitute or result in a further expansion of a nonconforming
use.
(b) Minor alterations and improvements which do not constitute or
require structural changes may be made in or to a building
wherein a nonconforming use exists, provided that such
nonconforming use will not be increased, extended or enlarged
thereby.
(c) Nothing herein shall prevent the strengthening or restoration
to a safe and lawful condition of any part of any building which
is nonconforming.
(3) Structural alterations, internal rearrangements and renovations
may be made in a building or structure which is nonconforming
because it fails to comply with height, area, yard, off-street parking
or other like requirements of this article, other than use, so long as
the structural alteration or increase, internal rearrangement or
renovation does not extend or enlarge the nonconformance of said
building or structure.
(4) A nonconforming use changed or altered to a conforming use may
not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use.
E. Restoration of existing building or structures nonconforming because of
use. Whenever a building or structure is nonconforming by reason of its
use, such building or structure may be restored or repaired in the event
of partial destruction thereof.
F. Restoration of existing buildings or structures nonconforming for
reasons other than use. Whenever a building is nonconforming because
it fails to comply with any height, area, yard, off-street parking or
requirements of this article, other than use, and such building is
partially destroyed, such building may be restored to its prior condition;
provided, however, that such restoration shall not enlarge the
previously existing nonconformance.
G. Nonconforming improved lot. When an improved lot in a residential
zone exists as a separate isolated lot under separate ownership and
does not adjoin any vacant land or vacant lot of the same owner, and
which said improved lot is nonconforming due to size, shape, area or
setback, any existing residential building or structure on the lot may be
further improved, provided that:
(1) The number of dwelling units shall not be increased even if such
increased number of dwelling units is allowed in the zone, unless
approved by the approving authority.

§ 234-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234-18
1:527
warrant denial of a license solely on the basis of lack of
experience.
(b) The reputation of the applicant for fair dealing in the
community, which shall be made among credible sources,
which sources shall be disclosed to the applicant in the event of
a denial of any license.
(c) Any criminal record of the applicant including any past

may, if all other factors are satisfactory, recommend a conditional
issuance of the license subject to the finding regarding the criminal
record.
(3) The Chief of Police, upon completion of the investigation, shall
recommend in writing to grant or deny the requested license to the
City Clerk, who shall grant or deny the license according to the
recommendation. In the case of recommending denial, the Chief of
Police shall state fully and specifically the reasons for the
recommendation. If the Chief of Police recommends denial of any
license, the City Clerk shall notify the applicant within 10 days of
§ 234-18 UNION CITY CODE § 234-18
1:528
such denial, and forward to the applicant a statement of the reason
or reasons for such denial.
(4) Grounds for recommending denial of license may include reliable
information indicating that the applicant has in the past engaged in
fraudulent or deceptive business practices in a business identical to
or similar to a dealer in secondhand goods. A license may be denied
if the investigation reveals a conviction of the applicant or any of its
principal officers or employees of any crime(s), disorderly persons
offense(s) in which deceit or misrepresentation is an element; or
any conviction of any crime(s) disorderly persons offense(s)
involving theft or the receiving of stolen goods, regardless of
whether the applicant was a principal, accessory before the fact,
after the fact, or a co-conspirator; or any prior municipal ordinance
violation(s) by the applicant of any of its principal officers or
employees in this or any other jurisdiction. A license may be denied
if the applicant fails to demonstrate an ability to satisfactorily
comply with the electronic reporting requirements specified in
Subsection E, the retention and inspection requirements of
Subsection F, or any other portion of this chapter. Upon receipt of
the recommendation of the Chief of Police, the City Clerk shall
issue or deny the license accordingly, contingent upon the receipt
of a bond as required by Subsection G of this section.
(5) Whenever any application for permit is denied, the applicant shall
be entitled to a hearing before a three-person panel appointed by
the Chief of Police, at which time the applicant shall be permitted
to introduce such evidence as may be deemed relevant to such
denial. Any applicant exercising the right to appeal must file a
written notice of appeal within 10 days of receiving written notice
of denial of a license to act as a dealer of secondhand goods.

dealer shall be required to do as follows:

secondhand goods acceptable identification as defined above in
Subsection B.

subsequently being subject to the penalties for doing so including
revocation of the dealer's license as described in Subsection F.
(6) It shall be the requisite duty of every dealer, and of every person in
the dealer's employ, to admit to the premises during business hours

Chief of Police, an investigation may be implemented. The Chief of
Police shall have the authority to grant the dealer a waiver of the

(6) Suspension. The Chief of Police or a designee thereof is hereby
empowered to temporarily suspend for cause any dealer's license

§ 234-18 UNION CITY CODE § 234-18
1:532
including failure to comply with any training or fees associated
with the electronic database software system in use by the
municipality; violation of any other statute, regulation, or local
ordinance; or any other illegal, improper, or fraudulent activity.
(b) Procedure for suspension. Upon determination that
appropriate grounds exist and that a suspension is warranted,
the Chief of Police or a designee thereof shall issue a written
notice of suspension of license to the offending dealer and to
the City Clerk, which shall set forth the grounds for the
suspension and notify the dealer of his or her right to appeal
pursuant to Subsection F(8). A temporary suspension shall
issue immediately, pending the outcome of any appeal taken.
Suspended dealers must immediately cease engaging in the
business of purchasing for resale, receiving for pawn, and/or
selling of precious metals and/or other secondhand goods in
the municipality until reinstatement.
(c) Reinstatement. Suspended dealers may be reinstated only
when the grounds leading to the suspension have, in the
determination of the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee,
been cured, corrected, or appropriately rectified; or if
reinstatement is deemed appropriate by the three-person
panel appointed by the Chief of Police, upon the timely filing of
an appeal as provided in Subsection F(8).
(7) Revocation. A license issued under this section may be revoked by
the City Clerk upon written recommendation from the Chief of
Police or the Chief's designee that the dealer is no longer qualified,
capable or competent to comply with the requirements of this
chapter. This penalty shall be in addition to any fines and penalties
the dealer may incur under Subsection I.

violation under this chapter; conviction for a criminal offense
within this or any jurisdiction; or multiple violations of any
other regulations or local ordinances within this or any
jurisdiction.
(b) Procedure for revocation. Upon a determination that
appropriate grounds exist and that a revocation is warranted,
the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee shall so report to the
City Clerk in writing. A temporary suspension will immediately
and automatically issue, if one is not already in effect, pending
the outcome of the charge. A three-person panel appointed by
the Chief of Police, shall review the stated ground for
revocation, and the panel shall issue an appropriate disposition
of suspension, revocation, or reinstatement. If the panel
determines that revocation is the appropriate disposition, it
§ 234-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234-18
1:533
shall set forth the grounds for the same in writing in the
form of a notice of revocation, which shall be provided to the
dealer. The notice shall advise the dealer to the right appeal.
If the panel determines that suspension is the appropriate
disposition, it shall provide the dealer with a notice of
suspension that shall advise the dealer of the right to appeal.
Following revocation, the dealer must relinquish his or her
license and must immediately and indefinitely cease operating
as a dealer of precious metals or other secondhand goods
within the municipality.

suspension or revocation shall be entitled to a hearing before a
three-person panel, appointed by the Chief of Police, at which time
the applicant shall be permitted to introduce such evidence as may
be deemed relevant to such suspension or revocation. Any
applicant exercising the right to appeal must file a written notice of
appeal within 10 days of receiving written notice of revocation or
suspension of license.

business provided that he or she notifies the City Clerk, in writing,
of the street address of said new location.

$10,000 conditioned for the due and proper observance of and
compliance with the provisions and requirements of all ordinances of

conduct of this business and conditioned also that the bond shall be and
remain for the benefit of any person or persons who shall have received
judgment against the dealer licensed under this section, which damage
shall be established by a judgment or a court of proper jurisdiction. This
bond shall contain the following language: "The obligation of this bond
shall, in addition to the City of Union City, be and remain for the benefit
of any person who shall obtain a judgment against the obligor as a
result of damage sustained in operation pursuant to any license granted

for a minimum of one year from the date of issuance of license and must
be renewed annually along with the license.

§ 234-18 UNION CITY CODE § 234-18
1:534

period from the date of its issuance.

dealer shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine not in
excess of the limitations of N.J.S.A. 40:49-5 or by a term of
imprisonment or a period of community service not exceeding 90 days

used for productive purposes, which will further the revitalization of the
City of Union City and improve its economic and social condition; and

governments under the laws of the State of New Jersey to address the
conditions created by these buildings, and further their reuse for
productive purposes; and

Properties Rehabilitation Act (N.J.S.A. 55:19-55) as amended by Section
28 of P.L. 2003, c. 210, the City will better be able to address the

RECORDS, PUBLIC ACCESS TO
§ 317-1. Purpose.
New Jersey has adopted the Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5,
which has as its general purpose making government records more
available to the public than they have been in the past. In certain instances,
the production of voluminous records, archived records, or records in a
format which is not the usual format maintained by the municipality or
other special circumstances is costly and time consuming. The New Jersey
Open Public Records Act permits the municipality to require the payment
of fees, special service charges and/or special charges as a prerequisite to
the production of records requiring extraordinary time and effort, special
equipment or special formatting.
§ 317-2. Custodian of records.
The City Clerk by law is the custodian of records for the City.
§ 317-3. Interpretation of documents.
Nothing in this chapter shall require the custodian of records or any other
municipal official to examine, analyze, tabulate, or interpret documents
which are subject to production under the New Jersey Open Public Records
Act.
§ 317-4. Records requests; advance notice of costs.
§ 317-5. Use of outside vendors for duplication; fees and special
service charges.
A. Requests to be in writing. Any requests for documents shall be made to
the City Clerk in writing and preferably on a form established by the
City Clerk for such purposes.
B. Advance notice of fees, special service charges and special charges;
deposit. Any requester of government records who may be eligible for
the imposition of a fee, special charge or special service charge under
this chapter shall receive advance notice of the amount of fees and
charges before any work is started. Whenever the costs of reproducing
a document exceed $5, the City Clerk shall require payment in full of
such charges before causing the work to begin.
A. Duplication or other work beyond capability of municipal in-house work
force. Whenever the in-house municipal work force or available
municipal equipment is insufficient to duplicate or produce government
records in a timely fashion, the City Clerk may cause such duplication
or production to be accomplished by outside vendors such as copy
centers or producers of digital images and, in the case of payroll

cannot be reproduced by regular copying equipment or fulfillment of
the request would involve extraordinary time and effort (for example,
where a large number of records must be recovered from storage or
substantive staff time is required to review, redact, sort and/or
assemble records), charges may be imposed as follows:
(1) The actual cost (materials and supplies but no staff labor) of
duplication or reproduction; plus

production or conversion of digital or computerized records or film
which is in a medium not routinely used by the agency (i.e., electronic
or film); not routinely developed or maintained by an agency; or
requires a substantial amount of manipulation or programming of
information technology, the requester shall pay fees and special
charges incurred by the City if the conversion is done directly by the
City as follows:

commercial tax appeals;

control on all types of residential units.
A. Applicability. The terms of this chapter apply to individual dwelling
units within a building, including condominium or cooperative units in
the process of being converted, or having been converted, rather than

the preapplication is filed. Additionally, the application must
provide satisfactory proof that the landlord will relocate the
tenants that are living in the building, at the landlord's cost, to
a suitable apartment during the rehabilitation, and will return

inquire as to the circumstances under which any unit became
vacant and reject the application if the Officer finds that the
landlord was engaged in harassing conduct in violation of
§ 334-13 of this chapter of any tenant for the three-year period
prior to the filing of the preapplication. The prerehabilitation
inspection and determination by the Rent Regulation Officer
shall ensure that the proposed renovations will meet the

1:652
(b) A series of photographs which show the condition of the
dwelling after the improvements.
(c) A copy of all bills, building permits, invoices and canceled

section and has, prior to the application being submitted
hereunder, withdrawn, canceled, dismissed, vacated or
otherwise repudiated all notices to quit, dispossess actions,
and judgments pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.1(k) and has

2A:18-61.1(k).
(g) The application for approval shall be filed by the landlord with
the Rent Stabilization Board not later than 20 days of the
tenant taking occupancy of the apartment.
D. Criteria for reviewing application. In reviewing said application, the
Rent Stabilization Board shall consider but not be limited to the
following factors:
(1) Whether the landlord has made a complete rehabilitation of the
dwelling which has improved the living conditions of the tenants
living in the dwelling. The requirements of HUD or the
governmental entity administering the rehabilitation for HUD shall
§ 334-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 334-12
1:653
be considered by the Board in determining the appropriateness of
the rehabilitation;
(2) The amount of the increase, with the general policy that no
increase should be approved which is unconscionable in relation to
the prior approved base rent. The rent that is allowed by HUD or
the governmental entity administering the rehabilitation program
shall be considered an acceptable new base rent, provided that the
landlord has provided proof to the Board that the landlord has
complied with all the requirements of this chapter and HUD in
obtaining the new rent, including notifications to the tenant. Upon
proof that the landlord is in compliance with the regulations of the
governmental rehabilitation program and this chapter, the landlord
shall be required to use the governmental approved rent as the
base rent, and for all subsequent rent increases the landlord shall
be required to use the rent increase approved by the governmental
entity. In the event a rent increase is allowed by the governmental
entity and the landlord fails to notify the tenants of the increase,
the landlord shall be considered to have waived the rent increase
for the year in question. If the governmental rehabilitation program
in question does not govern future rental increases and only
establishes the initial base rent after a complete rehabilitation of a
dwelling has occurred, then all increases shall be governed by
§ 334-10 of this chapter;
(3) In the event the governmental rehabilitation program in which the
landlord is enrolled contains tenant qualification guidelines and the
tenant does not quality pursuant to these regulations, the initial
base rent after the complete rehabilitation has occurred will be the
maximum base rent established by the governmental program, and
each subsequent increase shall be governed by § 334-10 of this
chapter; and
(4) That the landlord or its agents, employees or contractors have not
engaged in any harassment, provocation, retaliation of the previous
tenants of the subject unit or the new tenant to occupy the
renovated space and other conduct more specifically set forth in
§ 334-13 of the chapter.
E. Notification procedures. The landlord shall serve a copy of the final
application on each tenant by personal service or certified mail, return
receipt requested, at least 15 days before any hearing thereon, and the
landlord shall be required to file a proof of service with the Rent
Stabilization Board. Upon receipt of a complete application and proof or
service of same upon the tenant, the Rent Regulation Officer shall
schedule a hearing before the Rent Stabilization Board, and the
landlord shall serve upon each tenant, personally or by certified mail,
return receipt requested, at least 10 days in advance of said hearings, a
second notice advising the tenants that the final application for
approval previously served upon the tenant would be heard by the

remain in their units may do so without provocation or retaliation from
landlords. For the purposes of this section, harassment of tenants shall
mean conduct, whether direct or indirect, committed intentionally or
negligently by a landlord, or anyone acting on his/her behalf. These
actions include, but are not limited to:
(1) A reduction in the quality of basic services necessary to the health
safety and welfare of the tenants.
(2) Heat, hot water.
(3) Adequate security.
(4) Intermittent failures.
(5) Bothersome telephone calls or letters.
(6) Frivolous eviction threats or legal proceedings.
(7) Actions which would cause a reasonable person of like age and
physical condition of a tenant to fear for his/her life, limb, property
or home.
B. Investigation/prosecution of harassment complaints. The City shall
assign one of its municipal prosecutors to investigate and/or prosecute
complaints involving harassment filed by either tenants or landlords.
A. Required. No person shall occupy or use any residential unit after such
unit has been vacated or sold or where there has been a change in
occupancy until the landlord has applied for and secured a certificate of
continuing occupancy. Upon receipt by the enforcement officer of an
application for a certificate of continuing occupancy and payment of the
required fee, an inspection of the premises shall take place. The
inspection shall ensure compliance with all applicable building, health,
safety and fire codes, regulations, ordinances and statutes of the City of
Union City.

area violations except for those endangering the health and safety
of the occupants such as uninterrupted elevator service,
emergency lighting, fire and smoke alarms and other items
outlined in all applicable federal, state, county or local laws or
regulations. However, all other remedies promulgated by state and
municipal statutes, rules and regulations or those adopted by the
Board of Directors remain in place.
C. Failure to obtain certificate. A landlord who fails to obtain a certificate
of continuing occupancy shall be subject to any one or a combination of
the penalties listed in § 334-21. Any fines shall be payable to the City of
Union City.
D. Upon receipt by the enforcement officer of an application for a
certificate of continuing occupancy and fee, an inspection of the
premises shall take place. The inspection shall ensure compliance with
all applicable building, health, safety and fire codes, regulations,
ordinances and statutes of the City of Union City.
A. Continuation of services. During the term of this chapter, the landlord
shall maintain the same standards of service, maintenance, furniture,
furnishings and equipment in the housing space and dwelling as
required under the lease or otherwise mandated by law.
B. Decline in services. When services, care or maintenance, or when the

Regulation Officer, the Rent Regulation Officer shall schedule a hearing
on the application and shall notify both landlord and tenant of the date,
time and place of the hearing.
E. Maintenance of services. During a tenant's occupancy of a unit in which
the landlord provides utilities to the units of the building, the landlord
will be prohibited from constructing a separate apartment unit meter
and billing for any utility service previously provided by the landlord as
part of the services to the building, including but not limited to heat, hot
water, water and sewerage.
F. Violation and penalties. A first violation of § 334-15E of this chapter
shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $2,000 for each unit in
violation. Subsequent violations shall be punishable by a fine of not less
than $2,000 for each unit. Each day during which an owner is in
violation of § 334-15E of this chapter shall constitute a separate

SEWERAGE USER PERMITS  Any permit which is required of any
discharger or any potential discharger prior to the discharge of sewerage to
the treatment plant.
SURCHARGE FEE  The user fee charged to commercial/industrial users
whose discharge is monitored and whose BOD-5 concentration and/or SS
concentration exceeds 300 ppm.
TREATMENT COST  The total cost of operation, maintenance,
replacement, debt service, administration, billing and collection and related
costs applicable to the treatment plant.
TREATMENT PLANT  The North Hudson Sewer Authority or Passaic
Valley Sewer Authority Sewerage Treatment Plant.[Amended 5-21-2013]
USER FEE  The fee charged for the purpose of recovering the costs of

§ 342-13. Calculation of sewer user fees. [Amended 5-21-2013]
Sewer user fees shall charge to each user its proportionate share of costs
for sewerage treatment, including replacement, within the service area, and
shall be uniform throughout all areas subject to such sewer user fees under
this article for the same type, class and amount of use or service of the
sewer system. Sewer user fees shall be calculated in the following manner:
A. Surcharge fee. The North Hudson Sewer Authority or Passaic Valley
Sewer Authority shall annually estimate those portions of the treatment
charge applicable to the factors of BOD loading and SS loading, shall
establish surcharge rates for each factor, and shall charge commercial/
industrial dischargers whose BOD concentration exceeds 300 ppm and/
or whose SS concentration exceed 300 ppm a surcharge fee based on
such rates; surcharge fees for the BOD loading factor and/or the SS
loading factor shall be based on volume of usage times the
concentration of such factor in excess of 300 ppm times the rate; all
remaining charges to such dischargers for the factors of BOD loading
and SS loading where the BOD concentration and the SS concentration
are both equal to 300 ppm or less shall be calculated pursuant to the
calculation for conveyance and treatment fees. The surcharge fee
formula follows:
Factor base x volume of usage x BOD-5 in excess of 300 ppm x SS in
excess of 300 ppm
B. Conveyance and treatment fee. The North Hudson Sewer Authority or
Passaic Valley Sewer Authority shall develop a user fee rate per 1,000
gallons of sewerage discharge based on the sum of the conveyance cost
plus the treatment cost minus revenues from surcharge fees minus
other revenues and divided by the flow and shall charge each
discharger a user fee based such rate times the volume of discharge of
such discharger. The conveyance and treatment fee formula follows:

Authority or Passaic Valley Sewer Authority are due within 45 days of
issuance by the City, and Union City may impose penalty fees for the late
payment or nonpayment of such bills. Union City shall annually establish
penalty fees at the time user fees are established and may consider in its
determination of such penalty fees the amount owed, the duration of the
delinquency or other criteria. Union City reserves the right to waive or
modify penalties.
§ 342-17. Minimum user fee.
The City may annually charge to each discharger a minimum user fee,
regardless of any use of the sewer facilities, to cover expenses incurred by
the City for billing and collection, administration and a portion of the debt
service.

Works
§ 342-20. Findings.
§ 342-21. Purpose and policy.
The following sections set uniform requirements for discharges into the
wastewater collection and treatment system and enable the North Hudson
Sewerage Authority to comply with applicable effluent limitations, national
standards of performance, toxic and pretreatment effluent standards and
any other discharge criteria which are required or authorized by state or
federal law, and to derive the maximum public benefit by regulating the
quality and quantity of wastewater discharged into these systems.
A. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, P.L. 92-500, as amended by the
Clean Water Act of 1977, P.L. 95-217,62 as amended, the New Jersey
Water Pollution Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10A-1, and the New Jersey
Pretreatment Act, N.J.S.A. 58:11-59, have resulted in an unprecedented
program of cleaning up our nation's waters.
B. The North Hudson Sewerage Authority, a public body and politic and
political subdivision of the State of New Jersey existing under and by
virtue of the Municipal Utilities Law, N.J.S.A. 40:14B-1 et seq., is the
owner and operator of the sewage treatment facilities which serve the
Town of West New York and certain portions of the Town of Weehawken
and the City of Union City.
C. The North Hudson Sewerage Authority, Town of West New York, the
Town of Weehawken, the City of Union City and the Hudson County
Utilities Authority entered into an agreement dated October 1986, as
may be amended and supplemented.
D. The North Hudson Sewerage Authority has already made and will
continue to make a substantial financial investment its wastewater
treatment system to achieve the goals of the Act.
E. The North Hudson Sewerage Authority seeks to provide for the use of
its treatment works by industrial, commercial and residential users
served by it without damage to the physical facilities, without
impairment of their normal function of collecting, treating and
discharging domestic wastewater, and without the discharge by the
North Hudson Sewerage Authority treatment works of pollutants which
would violate the discharge allowed under its New Jersey Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System, NJPDES, permits, rules of the system
treating its waste and the applicable rules of all governmental
authorities with jurisdiction over such discharges.

materials through spills to the municipal sewer.
E. Access to property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes of
these rules and regulations, the Director, or his/her representative,
upon the presentation of credentials, may enter upon any property or
premises at reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting or copying
any records required to be kept under the provisions of this article. The
Director, or his/her representative, upon presentation of credentials,
may enter upon any property or premises at any time for the purpose of
inspecting any monitoring equipment or method and/or sampling any
discharge of wastewater to the treatment works.
F. Authority approval for discharge of certain wastes. Upon written
approval of the Authority, certain wastes which exceed the limits
imposed by this article may be permitted to be discharged into the
public sewer if a holding tank is employed and the wastes are released
at a constant rate over a twenty-four-hour period. This only applies to
intermittent flows or batch releases of short duration. Such approval
may be rescinded at any time by the Authority.
G. Control structures; installation, construction and maintenance. When
required by the Authority, the owner of any property served by a

be responsible for the proper removal and disposal, by appropriate
means, of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates
and means of disposal, which are subject to review by the Authority.
Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by
the owner's personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste
disposal firms.
I. Measurements, tests and analyses. All measurements, tests and
analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference
is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest
edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable
samples taken at such control manhole. In the event that no special
manholes have been required, the control manhole shall be considered
to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point
at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents
upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
J. Protection from accidental discharge.
(1) Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this
article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or
operator's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the Authority for review and shall be approved by the
Authority before construction of the facility. Review and approval of
such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial
user from the responsibility to modify his/her facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this article.
(2) Any possible connection of entry point for a persistent or
deleterious substance to the user's plumbing or drainage system
shall be appropriately labeled to warn operating personnel against
discharge of such a substance in violation of these regulations.

fails to connect to the sewer system within such period of time, he/she
shall be liable to a fine as set forth in Chapter 1, Article IV, General
Penalty, of this Code.
G. Nonavailability of public or private sanitary sewer.
(1) Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available, the
building sewer shall be connected to a private wastewater disposal
system complying with the provisions of this article. Before
commencement of construction of a private wastewater disposal
system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit signed by the
Authority. The application for such permit shall be made on a form
furnished by the Authority, which the applicant shall supplement by
any plans, specifications and other information as are deemed
necessary by the Authority. A permit and inspection fee as set forth
in Chapter 155, Fees, shall be paid to the Authority at the time the
application is filed.
(2) A permit for a private wastewater disposal system shall not become
effective until the installation is completed and appraised by the
Authority. The Authority shall be allowed to inspect the work at any
stage of construction. The applicant for the permit shall notify the
Authority when the work is ready for final inspection, and before
any underground portions are covered. The inspection shall be
made within 48 hours of the receipt of notice by the Authority.

§ 342-26. Wastewater volume determination.
§ 342-27. Permits.
(6) No statement contained in this section shall be construed to
interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by
the Health Officer.
A. Metered water supply. For premises where, in the opinion of the
Authority, a significant portion of water received from any metered
source is not consumed by the user or is not removed from the premises
by means other than community sewers, sewage discharged to the
community sewer shall be calculated based on water consumption as
indicated by the water meter reading. The amount of water used from
private sources shall be determined by means of a meter installed and
maintained at the expense of the user and approved by the Authority.
B. Metered wastewater volume and metered diversions. For premises
where, in the opinion of the Authority, a significant portion of the water
received from any metered source does not flow into the community
sewer because of the principal activity of the user or removal by other
means, the wastewater volume shall be the volume of wastewater
discharging from such premises into the community sewer. Written
notification and proof of the diversion of water must be provided by the
user if he/she wishes to dispute the Authority using the total amount of
water used from all sources as the measure of wastewater discharged
to the community sewer. If required by the Authority, such user must
install a meter of a type and at a location approved by the Authority and
at the user's own expense. Such meters may measure either the amount
of sewage discharged or the amount of water diverted. Such meters
shall be tested for accuracy at the expense of the user when deemed
necessary by the Director.
C. Estimated wastewater volume. For users where, in the opinion of the
Authority, it is unnecessary or impractical to install meters and where
the quantity of water diverted from the sewers amounts to 20% or more
of the total water used, the quantity of wastewater may be based upon
an estimate prepared by the Authority. This estimate shall be based
upon a rational determination of the wastewater discharged and may
consider such factors as the number of fixtures, seating capacity,
population equivalent, annual production of goods and services or such
other determination of water use necessary to estimate the wastewater
volume discharged.
A. Wastewater discharge permits; reports.
(1) The Authority shall require that any person discharging or
proposing to discharge wastewater into a community sewer file a
discharge report. The discharge report shall include, but not be
limited to, the nature of process, volume, rates of flow, mass
emissions, production quantities, hours of operation, personnel or
§ 342-25 UNION CITY CODE § 342-27
1:706
other information which relate to the generation of waste,
including substances and concentrations in the wastewater
discharge. Such reports shall also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid or gaseous materials stored on
site even though they may not normally be discharged.
(2) In addition to discharge reports, the Authority may require
information in the form of wastewater discharge permit
applications and self-monitoring reports.
B. Mandatory permits.
(1) All users defined as "critical users" must obtain a wastewater
discharge permit before connection to or discharging into a
community sewer.
(2) Any person who discharges, or is planning to discharge, wastes
characterizing such user as a significant indirect user (SIU) shall
obtain an NJPDES/SIU permit prior to commencing discharge into
the treatment works.
C. Temporary permits.
(1) The Director may issue a temporary wastewater discharge permit
to any user, upon application, in accordance with the terms of this
section, in the following categories:
(a) A user who requires an Authority estimation of wastewater
flow.
(b) Any person whose wastewater strength is less than the normal
range of wastewater strength because of pretreatment,
process changes or other reasons.
(2) Permits issued under this subsection shall remain in effect only
until such time as it is determined by the Director that a permit is
or is not required.
D. Permit application.
(1) Users seeking a wastewater discharge permit shall complete and
file with the Director an application, in the form prescribed by the
Director, and accompanied by the applicable fee. The applicant may

(11) An agreement that the discharger shall hold the Authority issuing
the permit harmless against all fines levied on the Authority by the
State of New Jersey, or any subdivision or agency thereof, as a
result of the polluting or unlawful discharge of matter into a
community sewer, storm drain or natural body of water by the
permit holder.
F. Expiration of permit.
(1) Unless otherwise specified on the permit, the terms and conditions
shall be subject to modifications or revocation. Permits shall be
issued for a period of three years. The user shall be informed of any
proposed changes in his/her permit at least 30 days prior to the
effective date of change. If not so informed, the permit may
automatically be extended an additional calendar year, but not to
exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a
year or may be specified to expire on a specific date.
(2) Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a
reasonable time schedule for compliance.
G. Transfer of permit. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit
shall not be reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new user,
different premises or a new or changed operation.
H. Revocation of permit. Any significant change in wastewater strength,
volume discharged or operations affecting the characteristics of
wastewater discharge may be grounds for modifying the terms and
conditions prior to the expiration date. Failure of the user to report
significant changes in their operations, wastewater discharge strength
or characteristics, or violation of conditions of the permit, may be
grounds for revoking a permit.
I. Violations of conditions of the permit.
(1) The conditions of wastewater discharge permits shall be uniformly
enforced by the Director in accordance with this article, applicable
state and federal regulations, and most practicable technology
available. Any discharger who violates the conditions of the permit

to having his/her permit revoked and ceasing discharge to the
community sewer following a reasonable notice period and
reasonable time to comply.
§ 342-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 342-27
1:709
§ 342-28. Right of entry for inspections.
The Municipal Health Officer, the Director, the Engineer and other duly
authorized employees of the Authority bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose
of inspection, observation, measurements, sampling and testing in
accordance with the provisions of this article.
§ 342-29. User classification.
All users shall be classified by assigning each one to a standard
classification category according to the principal activity conducted on his/
her premises, based on the typical wastewater strength for that type of
user as determined by the Authority. The purpose of such classification
is to facilitate the regulation of wastewater discharges based on quality,
quantity and flow to provide an effective means of source control and to
establish a system of wastewater service charges and fees which will insure
an equitable recovery of the Authority's cost. The elements of quality may
include, but not be limited to, the following: suspended solids, COD, oil and
grease and chlorine demand.
§ 342-30. Reporting and monitoring requirements.
(2) Failure of a user to factually report the strength, volume or
characteristics of his/her discharge or to refuse reasonable access
to their premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring of
pollution sources may be grounds for revoking the permit.
J. Trade secrets. All information and data pertaining to a user obtained
from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the
public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Authority that the release of such information to the general public
would divulge information, processes or methods which would give a
business advantage to competitors who did not otherwise have this
information. Contents, volume and frequency of discharge will not be
recognized as confidential information.
K. Special agreements. No statement contained in this article shall
prevent any special agreement or arrangement between the Authority
and any person where unusual circumstances compel special terms,
conditions and charges or fees for the collection, treatment and
disposal of the wastewater by the Authority.

§ 342-36. User charge system.
A. Establishment. A financial management system that will accurately
account for the revenues generated by the user charge system and
expenditures for the operation, maintenance and replacement of the
treatment system components shall be established. The accounting
system shall include recording of revenues, receipts and billings by
individual user and user class, report operation, maintenance and
replacement cost in total and unit process, record and report on billing
and collection activities and determine changes in assets, liabilities and
fund balances. The accounting system shall also reflect the budget and
conform to generally accepted accounting principals as set forth in the
New Jersey Local Authorities Accounting Principal and Auditing
Standards Manual.
B. Purpose of user charge system. The user charge system shall generate
adequate annual revenues to pay costs of annual operation and
maintenance, including replacement and costs associated with debt
retirement of bonded capital associated with financing the treatment
works which the City may, by ordinance, designate to be paid by the
user charge system. The user charge, that portion of the total sewer
service charge which is designated for operation and maintenance,
including replacement of the treatment works, shall be established by
this article.
C. Deposit of collected revenues. The revenues collected as a result of the
user charge levied shall be deposited in a separate nonlapsing fund
known as the "Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Fund," and
will be kept in two primary accounts as follows:
(1) Operation and maintenance account. An account designated for the
specific purpose of defraying operation and maintenance costs,
excluding replacement of the treatment works.

§ 342-35 UNION CITY CODE § 342-36
1:718
§ 342-37. Payment for costs of service.
Each user shall pay his/her proportionate share of operation, maintenance
and replacement costs for the services provided by the Authority based on
his/her proportionate contribution to the total wastewater loading from all
users as determined by water meter readings acceptable to the Authority.
to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user
charge rates for operation, maintenance and replacement. The user
charge rates shall be adjusted such that the transferred monies will
be returned to their respective accounts within six months of the fiscal
year in which the monies were borrowed.
A. Residential contributors. Quarterly user charges will be based on
average quarterly water usage.

actual water usage during the current quarter. If a commercial or
industrial contributor has a consumptive use of water, or, in some other
manner, uses water which is not discharged into the wastewater
collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based on
readings of a wastewater meter or separate water meter installed and
maintained at the user's expense, and in a manner acceptable to the
Authority.
C. Fixed charge.65
Annual debt service cost + annual billing and collection cost + annual
cost to treat infiltration/inflow = total annual fixed charges
(1) Residential user unit charge. The residential user unit charge is
calculated as follows, using the pollutant concentrations defining
"normal domestic wastewater" in § 342-35.
Residential unit charge unit flow charge + (unit BOD charge)
(BODND)(0.00834) + (unit SS charge) (SSND)(0.00834)

pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent
of the sludge from the Authority's treatment works, or any user which
discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other
substances caused identifiable increases in the cost of operation,
maintenance or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for such
increased costs. The charge for each such user shall be as determined
by the responsible plant operating personnel and approved by the
Authority.
F. Rates applicable to whom. The user charge rates established in this
article apply to all users of the Authority's treatment works within the
City of Union City.
A. Billing. All users shall be billed quarterly. Billings for any particular

constitute a lien on the property. If such lien, including interest and
penalty, remains unpaid for a period of one year after date of
recordation, such property shall be subject to public sale by the
Treasurer.
D. Appeal and review of user charge. Any user believing that he/she has
been incorrectly assigned to a particular user class or incorrectly
assigned a wastewater volume or strength or should any user believe
that a portion of his/her metered flow is not discharged into the
sewerage system, that user may apply for review of his/her user charge
as provided in § 342-40.
E. Users of more than 25,000 gallons per day. All users contributing more
than 25,000 gallons per day and whose waste strength is greater than
200 mg BOD/l or 250 mg SS/l shall prepare and file with the Authority a
report that shall include pertinent data relating to the wastewater
characteristics, including the methods of sampling and measurement to
obtain the data, and the data shall be used to calculate the user charge
for that user. The Authority shall have the right to gain access to the
waste stream and take its own samples. Should the Authority do so and
should the results be substantially different as determined by the
Authority Engineer from the data submitted by the user, the user
charge for that user shall be revised accordingly and shall be effective
retroactively up to 18 months.
A. Review and revision. The Authority will review the user charge system
at least every two years and revise user charge rates as necessary to
ensure that the system generates adequate revenues to pay the costs of
operation and maintenance, including replacement, and that the system
continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation and
maintenance, including replacement costs, among users and user
classes. Any excess revenues collected from a class of users shall be
credited to that class for the next year, and its rates will be adjusted
accordingly. Adequate records to document compliance with the user
charge requirements, including records of biennial reviews, will be
maintained.

and maintenance, including replacement, of the treatment works.
A. Any sewer user who feels his/her user charge is unjust and inequitable
as applied to his/her premises within the intent of the foregoing
provisions may make written application to the Authority requesting a
review of his/her user charge. Such written request shall, where
necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow and/or strength of
his/her wastewater in comparison with the values upon which the
charge is based, including how the measurements or estimates were
made.
B. Review of the request shall be made by the Authority and the Authority
Engineer, who shall determine if it is substantiated or not, including
recommending further study of the matter by the Authority Engineer.
C. If the request is determined to be substantiated, the user charges for
that user shall be recomputed based on the approved revised flow and/
or strength data, and the new charges thus recomputed shall be
applicable retroactively up to 18 months, as applicable.
A. Falsifying of information. Any person who willingly offers or presents to
the North Hudson Sewerage Authority or the City of Union City a
written statement containing a false statement or false information with
knowledge or belief that it will be filed with, registered or recorded in,

required to clean or repair the facility and add such charge to the user's
wastewater service charges.
D. General penalty provision. Any person who shall violate any provision of
this article for which a specific penalty is not provided, or any rules or
regulations hereunder, shall be liable to a penalty of not more than
§ 342-39 UNION CITY CODE § 342-41

of the City, installed or paid for any required off-tract improvements in the
manner provided below.
§ 370-15. Allocation of costs; criteria in determining allocation.
[Amended 3-21-2006]
A. The allocation of costs for off-tract improvements as between the
applicant, the property owners and the City, or any one or more of the
foregoing, shall be determined by the Planning Board or the Board of
Adjustment ("Board"), with the assistance of the appropriate City
agencies, on the basis of the total cost of the off-tract improvements,
the increase in market values of the property affected and any other
benefits conferred, the needs created by the application, population
and land use projections for the general area of the applicant's property
and other areas to be served by the off-tract improvements, the
estimated time of construction of the off-tract improvements and the
condition and periods of usefulness, which periods may be based upon
the criteria of N.J.S.A. 40A:2-22.
B. Requirements for off-tract improvements shall be consistent with
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42. In addition, the following criteria may also be
considered, as well as any other reasonable criteria the Board feels are
necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the City:
(1) Street, curb, sidewalk, shade tree, streetlight, street sign and
traffic light improvements may also be based upon the anticipated
increase of traffic generated by the application. In determining
such traffic increase, the Board may consider traffic counts,
existing and projected traffic patterns, the quality of streets and
sidewalks in the area and other factors related to the need created
by the application and the anticipated benefit thereto.
(2) Drainage facilities may also be based upon or be determined by the
drainage created by or affected by a particular land use,
considering:
(a) The percentage relationship between the square footage of the
property, the subject of the application, and the square footage
of the total drainage basin.
(b) The use of a particular site and the amount of the area to be
covered by imperious surfaces on the site itself.
(c) The use, condition or status of the remaining area in the
drainage basin.
(3) Water supply and distribution facilities may also be based upon the
added facilities required by the total anticipated water use
requirements of the property of the applicant and other properties
in the general area benefiting therefrom.

1:781
§ 370-16. Determination of cost. [Added 3-21-2006]

be required to provide a cash deposit to the City of one of following
amounts:
§ 370-18. Payment of allocated costs. [Added 3-21-2006]
(4) Sewerage facilities may be based upon the proportion that the total
anticipated volume of sewage effluent of the applicant's property
and other properties connected to the new facility bears to the
existing capacity of existing sewerage facilities, including, but not
limited to, sewer lines and other appurtenances leading to and
servicing the applicant's property. In the event that the applicant's
property shall be permitted to be connected to existing sewer
facilities, the applicant shall pay a charge or be assessed in
accordance with the law.
A. If the improvement is to be constructed by the City as a general
improvement, an amount equal to the difference between the estimated
cost of the improvement and the estimated total amount, if less, by
which all properties to be serviced thereby, including the subject
property, will be specifically benefited by the off-tract improvement.
B. If the improvement is to be constructed by the City as a local
improvement, then, in addition to the amount referred to in Subsection
A above, the estimated amount by which the subject property will be
specifically benefited by the off-tract improvement.
C. If the improvement is to be constructed by the applicant, an amount
equal to the estimated cost of the off-tract improvements, less an offset
for benefits to properties other than the subject property.
A. The estimated costs of the off-tract improvements allocated to the
applicant, if deposited in cash, shall be paid by the applicant to the City
Treasurer, who shall provide a suitable depository therefor, and such
funds shall be used only for the off-tract improvements for which they
are deposited or improvements serving the same purpose, unless such
improvements are not initiated by the City within a period of 10 years
from the date of payment, after which said funds so deposited shall be

successors or assigns shall be repaid an amount equal to the difference
between the deposit and its share of the actual cost.

Board are unreasonable, it may challenge them and seek to have them
revised in appropriate proceedings brought to compel subdivision or
site plan approval.
E. If the applicant and the Board cannot agree with respect to the
applicant's appropriate share of the actual cost of the off-tract
improvement, or the determination made by the City officer or board
charged with the duty of making assessments as to special benefits if
the off-tract improvement is to be constructed as a local improvement,
no approval shall be granted; provided, however, that the applicant may
challenge such determination and seek to have it reviewed in

§ 381-1. Findings.
The Board of Commissioners finds and declares that the entire City is an

evidence of substantial Housing or Health Code violations in at least 25% of
the dwelling units in the City, as provided for by N.J.A.C. 5:45-1.2(a)2; and
in accordance with the City's Housing Element and Fair Share Plan dated
March 2009, over 90% of the housing units in Union City were built prior to
1970, which exceeds the requirement that at least 25% of the dwelling units
in the City be at least 40 years old, as provided for by N.J.A.C. 5:45-1.2(a)3.
Specifically, according to the 2000 Federal Decennial Census, 69.4% of the
dwelling units were constructed prior to 1960. Thus, the entire City of
Union City is an area in need of rehabilitation, as provided for by N.J.S.A.

The City, through its subcode official or his/her designate, may reject any
application for a permit, revoke a permit or require the removal of the
existing outdoor public telephones or restrictions to outgoing calls only if
it has reason to believe that such telephone has the potential to and has
illustrated a propensity to create or contribute to illegal or illicit activities
or otherwise infringes on the use and access to the public sidewalk. The
subcode official can consider, among other items, three complaints of
possible illegal activity about the same address within a month period as
"illicit activity" or more than 12 reported criminal incidents in a year prior
to the date of the application, which incidents have resulted in convictions.

the community, the subcode official shall conduct a hearing after providing
written notice of same at least 10 days in advance thereof to all parties
to ascertain whether the location and use of the telephone interferes with
the public safety and whether the location or use of the public telephone
constitutes a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the community.

that the location and the use of the public telephone constitutes a threat
to the health, safety and welfare of the community, the subcode official
shall revoke any permit issued for use of such public telephone immediately
thereafter and require the telephone to be removed. In the event that the
Construction Code Official does not find that the location or the use of
the telephone constitutes a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the
community but does create a nuisance to the public which needs to be
abated, then the Construction Code Official may order such other relief
as (s)he deems fair under the circumstances, including, but not limited to,
requiring the telephone to be restricted to outgoing calls only. A "threat to
health, safety and welfare" shall include, but not be limited to, the activity
referred to in §§ 391-11 and 391-15 establishing the location and placement
of the telephone.

telephone. This location provision shall not apply to properly permitted
telephones which are currently located on City sidewalks. Any telephone for
which the permit expires and is not renewed within 30 days of its expiration
shall be subject to removal and subject to the location requirements of this
section. Telephones which are impounded or removed shall not be replaced
except in accordance with the provisions of this article.
§ 391-17. Removal of telephones; charges.

article, then the telephone shall be impounded by the City. Such
telephone shall not be released until proper ownership and permits are
presented and/or permit fee and fines are paid, together with a
removal/storage charge as set forth in Chapter 155, Fees. [Amended
5-21-2013]
B. If no person files a claim for the return of the telephone or complies
