1212.01 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR LAND USE PLANNING IN THE
LODI AREA.
The following statements of goals and objectives represent concepts, development criteria and local desires developed from objective planning standards and from a series of discussions with the Lodi Planning Commission. As such, these goals and objectives provide a basis for formulation of the Lodi Development Policy Plan and for review of development proposals which will affect land use in the Lodi planning area.
(a) General goals are to:
(1) Promote a Village land use pattern that is logical both in the relation of
land uses to one another and to the community facilities and
transportation facilities which serve the Lodi area's population;
(2) Provide opportunities for appropriate economic growth and
diversification in the Lodi area;
1992 Replacement
5
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.01
(3) Provide adequate housing for those persons living, or desiring to
live, in the Lodi area;
(4) Provide for planned, orderly provision of sewer and water facilities
in the Lodi area; and
(5) Encourage development which is consistent with the community
interest and which will be in harmony with the natural and man-
made amenities of the Lodi area,
(b) Specific objectives are as follows:
(1) Residential development.
A. New residential development shall be planned which will be safe,
convenient to local services and in harmony with the small-town
atmosphere of Lodi. To do this, the Village plan must provide
direct, convenient and proper access from all parts of the Village to
the center for proper accessibility to parks, schools and shopping.
B. Higher density development should be encouraged to develop
where it will be possible to create active pedestrian circulation
between adjacent residences, recreation areas, shopping facilities
and other local services.
C. Residential development should be planned to conform to the
natural characteristics of the land. Specifically, detailed
consideration needs to be given to topography, soil conditions,
surface water (i.e. ponds and creeks) and existing land cover.
(2) Commercial development.
A. Appropriate areas for each of three kinds of commercial
development shall be provided, recognizing that different types of
commercial activities have different site requirements. The three
kinds are the Village center, vehicular oriented development along
major arterials and the concentrated shopping center serving a
more extensive area.
B. The development of compact commercial areas shall be
encouraged wherever possible in order to minimize disruption of
traffic on roads and to maintain the character of existing
residential areas. Major traffic arteries need not be
considered automatically for commercial development solely
because of the number of vehicles they carry. The functions of
traffic movement and access to adjacent properties are often at
odds. On the other hand, residential development is not unrealistic
on major traffic arteries if adequate separation between traffic and
residences is provided.
6
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.01
C. Concentrated shopping center retail areas should be located carefully so
as to Void adverse effects on the character of the residential areas they
serve.
D. The basic function of the central business district of the Village of Lodi
Should be maintained: to serve the retail and service needs of the area's
individuals, businesses and industries. New development should be
encouraged which will facilitate and enhance the primary pedestrian
character of this area of the Village. Development which will generate high-
traffic volumes and thereby disrupt pedestrian traffic in the downtown area
(e.g. drive-in restaurants, etc.) should be discouraged or carefully controlled.
(3) Industrial development.
A. An adequate supply of land shall be provided to permit controlled industrial
growth through expansion of existing industries and development of new
industries in the Lodi area.
B. Land should be designated for industrial development on the basis of optimum
conditions in each of the following categories:
1. Availability or potential availability of utilities such as water, sewer and
power;
2. Ease of access to major transportation networks;
3. Favorable physical conditions, including consideration of soils, flooding
potential, topography, land cover and unique environmental features; and
4. Adequate parcel size.
C. Industrial zones should be provided to properly separate
industrial areas from surrounding residential areas.
D. Industrial areas should be protected from encroachment by
nonindustrial uses which could hinder the efficient
development and functioning of existing or future industries.
1992 Replacement
7
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.01
(4) Thoroughfare system.
A. A hierarchy of street types, reflecting the need to accommodate
different volumes of traffic in different areas, should be
developed, giving due consideration to existing traffic volumes
and the adequacy of existing thoroughfares.
1. The limited access thoroughfare or expressway should be
designed to carry heavy volumes of traffic at fast speeds and
be completely free from direct access. Access from other
streets should be gained only through separated,
directionalized traffic movements in the form of grade-
separated interchanges. By virtue of design, these
thoroughfares should be capable of moving traffic faster and
safer than any other type of road.
2. Major arterials should provide direct access across the
community as well as to neighboring communities. These streets should have controlled (signalized) intersections wherever possible.
3. Collector streets should collect traffic from minor streets
and direct it to major thoroughfares. Collector streets should not extend uninterrupted for long distances. Otherwise, they might take on the traffic characteristics of major arterial routes.
4. Local or minor streets should be designed primarily as
service streets for carrying the traffic that contiguous land uses generate. Since they are required to carry only low volumes traffic, their design is primarily oriented to providing the best possible building sites rather than providing an alignment for the greatest volume of traffic. Local streets should be designed to discourage through traffic.
B. Land use proposals should result in a minimum of traffic across
dangerous at-grade railroad crossings and along stretches of road,
which, due to alignment, grade or other safety features, could not
be made suitable for carrying large volumes of traffic without
unreasonable expense.
8
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.01
C. Land use proposals should be in general harmony with the existing
transportation network in the Lodi area. High-density proposals
should be served directly by an existing major arterial or limited
access thoroughfare, while low density residential areas should be
served directly by minor or local streets. This strategy will prevent
conflicts from development between existing or future land use
and the streets which serve particular areas.
(5) Community facilities.
A. Adequate fire and police protection facilities and government
administrative offices should be provided which will serve the
existing and future population of the Village of Lodi.
B. Maximum community use should be made of existing and planned
public school facilities.
C. Outdoor recreation facilities and open space areas should be
developed and preserved which will provide a full range of outdoor
recreation opportunities for Lodi area residents and which will
preserve those unique environmental features of the Lodi area
which are of significant value to residents of the Lodi area and
Medina County as a whole.
D. The extension of public utilities and services should follow
urban development on the periphery of the Lodi area. Urban
services should be discouraged in areas where the cost
of providing such services would be prohibitively high, where
natural characteristics of the area are such that development would
negatively alter unique natural features, or where development
would be negatively affected to a significant extent by existing
physical conditions, such as flood hazard potential or slippage due
to steep topography.

1212.02 DEVELOPMENT POLICY ALTERNATIVES FOR THE VILLAGE
OF LODI.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Planning Commission responses are underlined.)
(a) Urban Growth. Extent of growth desired by the Village.
(1) Should growth be encouraged at increased densities within areas
already developed at lesser densities? NO
(2) Should growth be encouraged to occur within areas presently
undeveloped at densities similar to adjacent areas already
developed? YES
(3 If increased urban growth density is desired, what specific type and
density is desired:
In R-l Districts, four units per acre
In R-2 Districts, six units per acre
In R-3 Districts, eight units per acre
The Planning Commission agreed that land in the eastern portion of the Village should be developed for residential purposes. The intent of allowing mobile home developments was to provide a good mix of housing types in the Village.
(4) Should growth be discouraged in general? The Planning Commission
feels that growth should be of a planned, orderly nature.
(5) What type of community is desired: bedroom community, industrial
center, commercial center? The Planning Commission would like to
encourage balanced small town living with the conveniences of a
city. The Commission also would like to encourage developing into a
community where most of the residents live and work within the
Village.
(b) Thoroughfares. An increase in growth will subsequently necessitate an
increase in the number of thoroughfares or an increase in the capacity of
existing thoroughfares.
(1) What arterials, if any, need to be expanded from two-lane to four-
lane? None
(2) What other thoroughfare improvements are needed? Buffham Road
(Two. Rd. 72). along with Greenwich Road (C.H. 97) and Avon Lake Road (S.R. 83) may need to be widened in the future.
(3) Are the thoroughfares in Lodi adequate? The major problem is
dead-end streets in the northeast section of the Village. Additional residential growth in this area will increase the need to tie in residential streets with existing streets.
10
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.02
(c) Public Services. As the Village grows, additional services will also become
necessary.
(1) Is the existing sewer and water facility adequate? The existing
sanitary sewer facility has been designed for a population of 5.100
with the present Village population being approximately 3.000. The
location of the present treatment facility is felt to be excellent.
Improvements to the storm water drainage system have been
undertaken in the eastern portion of the Village where drainage
problems exist, and more improvements are planned in this area.
(2) What is the present school capacity? Should any new school
facilities be considered? The Cloverleaf School District encompasses
five townships and includes five grade schools, one junior high
school and one high school.
(3) Is the present status of police and fire protection adequate? What are
their shortcomings? What improvements or expansion, if any, should be considered to adequately service anticipated growth? Quality and quantity of police protection are felt to be good. Quality of fire protection is also good. The addition of a fire station on the west side of the Village would be desirable due to potential crossing problems created by the Norfolk and Western Railroad tracks running from the northwest to the southern portion of the Village.
(d) Open Space. The need for open space, either as passive or active,
will become more apparent as the Village grows hi size and density.
(1) If new areas of open space are desired, should these areas be left in
their natural state and developed for passive uses such as hiking and picnic facilities? The Planning Commission has gone on record for open space in the Village. Current open space areas consist of two community parks: Lodi Community Park and Central Park, plus Letha House Field.
(2) Is there a need for active recreational uses such as ball fields,
swimming pools, playgrounds, etc.? If so, in what areas of the Village is the need greatest? Two outdoor ball parks, one outdoor basketball court and two outdoor tennis courts presently exist. The need also exists for a swimming pool although the possibility of one being built in the near future is quite slim. Letha House Field is the most logical place for further development of active recreational activities.
11
1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.03
(3) Should the Village incorporate the frequent use of green belt areas
throughout the community? Three areas for future consideration
were mentioned:
A. The Arch of the Black River west of the Village on S.R. 421;
B. The Whetstone Creek area; and
C. Gravel pit areas.
(e) Other. The Village might consider developing some unique community
features into a primary focal point. This could involve physical features
such as unusually scenic topographic areas, streams, large trees, etc. A
unique focal point could also be the development of the Village center into
a quaint and unusual shopping area with numerous specialty shops utilizing
a similar architectural theme. The Central Park was felt to be an
appropriate focal point for the Village, being the location of outdoor
concerts, the Indian statue, etc.
1212.03 SUMMARY OF EXISTING DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS IN THE VILLAGE.
(a) In General. The Village of Lodi, consisting of approximately two square miles in area, is situated within the southwestern portion of Medina County. Accessibility to and from the Village is provided by two State highways (S.R. 83 and S.R. 421) that traverse the corporation and one Federal divided highway (U.S. 224) that bypass a mile north of Lodi.
A survey of the land use in the Village was carried out in January, 1976, to provide information needed for the future development of a policy plan. Among the major purposes it serves are the following:
(1) To acquire information about the size and actual use of each parcel of
property, the use and occupancy of each building and the yard and other open
spaces about it;
(2) To gain a broad overview and understanding of the entire planning area in
terms of predominant uses and activities;
(3) To acquire an understanding of relationships between the various types of land
uses and activities;
(4) To help establish the proper general location and approximate size of
needed public facilities and services; and
(5) To gain a clear insight into existing conditions and relationships which are a
prerequisite to the best practical application of sound growth policies and the
12
subsequent zoning districts.
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.03
(b) Physical Characteristics of the Village and its Surrounding Area.
(1) The Village of Lodi is interlaced with numerous drainage courses that eventually drain into the East Fork tributary of the Black River. Two branches of the East Fork cut significant ravines within the Village before turning northward to empty into the Black River. Due to these precipitous ravines, the Lodi area experiences topographic variations that range from the lowest elevation in Medina County of 860 feet above sea level, occurring northwest of the Village, to elevations in excess of 1,100 feet above sea level occurring in the northeast section of the community.
(2) The physical development and basic shape of Lodi can be related directly to the extensive muck lands lying south of the Village. One may assume that the availability of these productive muck lands influenced Lodi's early location as an agricultural center. The Village center developed upon relatively level ground where major transportation routes junction, skirting the impenetrable muck lands to the south. Later, when the railroad also passed through this same area, skirting the muck lands, the Village location was further strengthened. The Village gradually grew using up the original level area and proceeded to extend development onto the adjacent hills and plateaus between the numerous drainage courses. Consequently, due to these muck lands, Lodi's physical growth, having been directed northward and westward in the past, will in all probability continue to do so in the future as new growth occurs. Also having an effect on Lodi's future growth is the FIA Flood Hazard Boundary Map recently published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This map shows significant areas of the Village designated as Special Flood Hazard Areas which will be affected by the new flood insurance program. (See Map following the text of this chapter.) In short, these designated areas will be restricted as to what types of development might occur in the future.
(3) Soil types within the general area range from a Chili-Urban land complex located within the Village center to extensive areas of Carlisle muck located south of the Village. The following list describes the primary soil types occurring within the planning area:
13
1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.03
A. Bennington silt loam. This soil, occurring in irregular five to seventy-five acre
shapes, is concentrated throughout the west and northwest sectors of the planning area. Seasonal wetness and slow permeability are common characteristics of this soil type.
B. Cardington silt loam. This soil, occurring in irregular five to 300-acre shapes,
occupies much of the uplands of the northern portions of the Lodi area. Surface runoff is moderate to rapid; consequently, erosion is a moderate hazard. Like the Bennington soils, seasonal wetness and slow permeability create limitations to many nonfarm uses.
C. Carlisle muck. This soil, ranging in size up to approximately 400 acres, is
located primarily south of the Village. This extremely wet soil must be drained to be utilized. Crop production on this soil, if well managed, is well suited for vegetable and sod production. Due to the excessive instability of this soil it is limited to crop production.
D. Chili-Urban land complex. This gently, sloping soil is located primarily within
the Village center. It consists of areas of Chili soils that have been partly disturbed as a result of grading and digging operations. The fill areas are characterized by approximately one to three feet of fill material overlying Chili soils. These areas are commonly low in organic matter and available water capacity; consequently, few limitations to most nonfarm uses exist.
E. Jimtown-Urban land complex. This nearly level soil area is one that also has
been disturbed as a result of grading and digging operations. These soil areas
consist of thin layers of sand and gravel having good drainage qualities.
F. Wallkill silt loam. This soil, occurring in oblong shapes of twenty-five acres or
less, is located immediately south of the Village. Approximately sixteen inches of alluvium cover the lower organic matter in this soil; consequently, excessive wetness and flooding hazard exist, creating limitations for many nonfarm uses.
(c) Major Land Use Patterns Within the Village. The Village of Lodi covers an area of approximately 1,337 acres. Of this acreage, only 525 acres of 39.3 percent has been developed for urban or urban-related purposes. The remaining acreage is open and exists as either developable vacant land or areas of undevelopable steep topography and marshlands.

1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.03
Primary development patterns within the Village consist of residential uses utilizing the greatest amount of developed land. Two hundred twenty-five acres, or 16.8 percent of the total Village area, is developed with either single-family, two-family, multifamily or mobile homes. Although the primary concentrations are still within the Village center, new development is occurring to the east and northeast of the Village.
Commercial development is concentrated in two areas: the Village square and the Medina Street-Highland road vicinity. The latter, being more recent, will in all probability realize further expansion due to its accessibility to U.S. 224 and the availability of land for expansion.
Industrial uses comprise the second greatest user of land in Lodi. Approximately seventy-five acres or 5.6 percent of the Village is utilized for light and heavy industrial purposes. Industrial lands are concentrated within the western and southern sections of the Village. Future expansion will be restricted to these same areas due primarily to excessive topographic variations throughout the remainder of Lodi.
Transportation is a predominant land use in Lodi. Street and railroad right of ways entail approximately 117 acres of land within the Village alone. Consequently, these facilities provide a good base for future growth. Access to Interstate 71 and U.S. 224 can be easily attained from Lodi. Good railroad accommodations exist within the west and southwest sectors of the Village where the need is greatest to facilitate existing and future industrial activity.
Land occupied by community facilities entails approximately fifty-one acres or 4.6 percent of the Village. Community facilities, for the purpose of this report, include schools, the fire station, water towers, the hospital, cemeteries, sewage treatment and public parks and recreational facilities. Several of these items, such as sewer and water facilities will require future detailed study and planning due to their direct relationship to future growth. The cost of these expanded facilities will have to be carefully evaluated when determining the desired growth and types of growth throughout the Village of Lodi.
The map titled "Generalized Land Use Patterns," following the text of this chapter, presents in a generalized graphic form the major land use patterns within the Village. The land uses indicated on the map have been restricted to three basic uses: residential, commercial and industrial.

1992 Replacement

Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.04
(d) Conclusion. The land use patterns within the Lodi planning area can be directly related to the physical make-up of the area. As previously discussed, particular physical features, such as the extensive muck areas and the varying topography, have played a prominent role in the general shape of the Village of Lodi. The map titled "Areas With Severe Limitations for Development," following the text of this chapter, shows in a generalized form the three major types of physical restraints to development. These physical restraints (muck soils, flood hazard areas and steep topography) not only restricted past development to specific areas, but will in all probability do so in the future. Consequently, these physical data are utilized in the Lodi Development Policy Plan as formulated.
There has been no significant change in the percentage of land use through 1991. The small amount of development in the last sixteen years has not changed the percentage of land use, except for minor adjustments.

Although this survey indicated relatively few houses being in need of major rehabilitation, the need for additional housing exists for the Village of Lodi. A survey of housing needs within Medina County was recently performed relative to a Medina County Housing Policy Program. This survey, which utilized the Fourth Count Summary Data from the 1970 Census of Housing, indicated, among other things, that the County is in need of an additional 743 occupied units and 1,358 rental units for lower-income households. Although this need is County-wide, significant concentrations on this housing need were indicated for the Harrisville Township and Village of Lodi area. The recently approved forty-eight unit apartment being processed by the Farmers Home Administration for the northern sector of Lodi indicates that the need does exist in this area and is being partially alleviated according to the goals of the Housing Policy Program.
1212.05 PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE LODI AREA.
(a) Parks.
(1) Letha House Field, located in the southeast corner of the Village of
Lodi, is situated on a 5.037 acre parcel on the south side of Wooster
Street. The parcel is owned by the Village of Lodi and has been leased to
the Lodi Chamber of Commerce. The park area is used for a variety of
athletic field sports by clubs and organizations in the Lodi area. Also
included on the site is a building, which had been used as a locker room
for Lodi High School, and eight fifty-foot power poles with light banks
and transformers.
(2) Lodi Community Park, situated on the east bank of the East Fork
Tributary of the Black River, is a multi-purpose park centrally located
within the Village. Facilities are provided for picnicking and recreation
for children. The twelve-acre park is ideally situated, being surrounded
by steep terrain formed by the East Fork Tributary.
(3) Central Park, a one-acre parcel located in the downtown portion of the
Village, is used for a variety of community events, in addition to being a
place of simple relaxation for persons in the Village. The location and
nature of the park make it a focal point of the Lodi community.
(4) Of additional recreational significance for the Village of Lodi are the
ball fields and courts which are part of the Cloverleaf Local School
District Junior and Senior High Schools located in Westfield Township
near the junction of U.S. 224 and C.R. 35 (Friendsville Road).
Recreation facilities at the Cloverleaf Junior and Senior High Schools
include two separate gyms, three tennis courts, one baseball diamond,
two practice fields and one football field. Facilities at the Lodi
Elementary School include a playground with standard playground.

equipment. These facilities (except for the Senior High School football
field) are available for community use year-round. However, the facilities
of Cloverleaf Junior and Senior High Schools, being nearly two and one-
half miles from the concentration of population in Lodi, cannot be
regarded as having major recreational potential for the residents of Lodi.
(b) School. Students from the Lodi area attend schools which are part of the Cloverleaf School District. This School District includes the following communities:
Townships Villages
Harrisville Lodi
Westfield Westfield Center
Guilford Seville
Chatham Gloria Glens
Lafayette Briarwood Beach

The above data for the Junior and Senior High Schools include all students, including those from Lodi.
It should also be noted that children from the Village of Lodi and Harrisville Township attend St. Francis Xavier School, a parochial school in Medina, Ohio.
The original structure of the present Lodi Elementary School, which formerly served grades K-12, was built in 1914, with additions in 1921, 1951 and 1954. The Cloverleaf Junior High School was opened in 1971, while the Senior High School was opened in 1960.
Thirty school buses serve the 120-square mile Cloverleaf Local School District, including most of the students from the Village of Lodi.
(c) Water Supply. The Village of Lodi is served by a three-well water system. Total capacity is 1,100 gallons per minute (GPM). Treatment of water is by filtration and softening. The plant design allows for a fifty percent expansion with the addition of wells. The water is stored in three elevated storage tanks totaling 310,000 gallons. Water is provided to the customers with a four-inch to eight-inch line distribution system.
The Lodi water system is a two-level service system based on the ground elevation, with a ground elevation of approximately 1,000 feet being the break point between the two systems. The high level system services the major residential area in the northeast portion of the Village.
As of November, 1991, the Lodi water system had approximately 1,475 customers. Average daily consumption in1990 was 450,000 gallons per day (GPD). By the year 2000, consumption can be expected to total approximately 565,000 GPD, less than forty percent of the capacity of the three existing wells.
Consideration in the future will need to be given to ensuring adequate fire flows with anticipated population and economic growth.

(d) Wastewater. The original Lodi Wastewater Treatment Plant, consisting of an Imhoff tank and sand filters, was replaced by a mechanical aeration system in the early 1950's. Regulations regarding the quality of treated wastewater entering streams and lakes led to the addition of secondary, tertiary and chlorination facilities to the Lodi Wastewater Treatment facility in 1973 and 1988. A future expansion is expected to be completed in 1993.
The present facility, located at the end of Grandview Drive, discharges into the East Fork Tributary of the Black River. The plant will be capable of biologically treating the wastes from a population equivalent of 6,000. The average design flow will be 510,000 GPD after the 1993 expansion. The plant normally operates at 97% efficiency in the reduction of BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) and 95% efficiency in the removal of suspended solids.
(e) Police Protection. The Lodi Police Department has an average of 150 walk-ins (personal inquiries) and 300 phone inquiries per month. The police units make an average of 500 calls per month, with a breakdown as follows:
Traffic Cities Building Checks Details
100 201 108 124
Over the past five pay periods the Police Department averaged 281 activities per period. This indicates a minimum average of 562 activities per month. The number one activity is the details that officers are assigned to do on a daily basis. The second activity is building checks, either business, industrial or residential. The third activity is traffic, with about 100 stops per month with an average of twenty citations per month. The most common calls relate to theft, domestic problems and such miscellaneous matters as barking and howling dogs, loose dogs, junk vehicles, high weeds, etc. During this time period an average of 4,132 miles were logged on the Police Department vehicles in 365.9 hours of running time. The present mobile units include one 1988 Ford and one 1989 Ford Crown Victoria. Both vehicles are in excellent condition.
The Village police force has the following manpower:
Sworn officers (full-time) 4
Radio operators (dispatchers) 0
Auxiliary personnel 2
Sworn officers (part-time) 3
Volunteers
(f) Fire Protection. The Village of Lodi and Harrisville Township are serviced by a single Volunteer Fire Department centrally located in Lodi. The force is authorized for thirty persons, with the force level usually being approximately twenty to twenty-five persons, including the Chief and a first and second assistant.

The Norfolk and Western Railroad tracks crossing the Village create a significant potential problem of fire protection south of the railroad tracks, where industry is concentrated. If a train happens to be blocking access to the area south of the tracks where a fire is underway, fire trucks must take an alternative route, using the U.S. Routes 42 and 224 by-pass to reach the fire site. This potential delay in fire response time could be critical, especially for the industries located in the southwestern portion of the Village. The Village should assess the degree of seriousness of this problem and the relative cost of alternative measures necessary to correct it.
As noted in the analysis of existing public services, the southwest quadrant of the Lodi Planning Area, where industry is concentrated, can be cut off from direct fire protection service in the event a train is crossing the N & W railroad tracks at Bank Street. Fire equipment in these circumstances must travel north on S.R. 421, west of U.S. 224 and 42, south on Richman Road and east on Bank Street to reach a fire. One alternative to consider is the construction of a fire substation on Bank Street west of the N & W tracks to serve this section of the Lodi Planning Area.
(g) Library Services. The Lodi Library opened officially in 1960, the result of the efforts of various organizations and volunteers. In 1989 the present location at 226 Wooster Street was extensively remodeled. The Lodi Library is one of five community libraries which comprise the Medina County District Library System.
In 1989 the Medina County District Library finished automating the circulation system connecting Lodi Library with the other four community libraries, as well as with seventeen other library systems in northern Ohio which are part of the ClevNet automation system.
The Lodi Library offers a variety of materials and services: adult, young adult and children's books, fiction and nonfiction; large print books; magazines and newspapers; video cassettes; and audio cassettes and compact disks. Programs and activities for all ages are offered throughout the year. Services to the homebound are also available through Outreach Services.
The Lodi Library has a collection of 24,000 items. With the use of the Library's reserve and FAX systems, however, patrons have access to many more books, magazines and newspapers than can be found on the Library's shelves.
The Lodi Library employs a staff of five and is open every day except Friday and Sunday. For more information call 948-1885.
(h) Hospitals. The Lodi Community Hospital, a thirty-bed accredited, medical/surgical hospital, is located on a nine acre site on the west side of Elyria Street in Lodi near the central area of the Village. Care provided includes in-patient, out-patient and twenty-four hour emergency room physician's service. Additional services include specialized diagnostic capabilities; an industrial health program; respite care for
25
dependent adults; surgery; and community education. The Hospital also owns Century-of-Love Preschool located at 411 Medina Street in Lodi.
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.06
The medical staff at Lodi Community Hospital includes twenty physicians. There are thirty-eight persons on the courtesy and consulting staff, including dental, podiatric and allied health professionals. A specialty physician's clinic provides the services of additional visiting specialists on a regular basis. There are a total of 140 additional Hospital employees, approximately twenty-five percent of whom are from Lodi.
Emergency ambulance service to the facility is provided through Lodi EMT and through local communities surrounding Lodi, including Westfield Center, West Salem, Chatham, Burbank, Sullivan, Spencer, Chippewa Lake and Seville. An emergency air transport system also services the Hospital on a call basis.
(i) Cemeteries. Lodi's main cemetery, Woodlawn Cemetery, is located on the northwest side of Medina Street (S.R. 421) north of the central area of the Village. The facility is managed by an independent cemetery board.
1212.06 LODI DEVELOPMENT POLICY PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS.
(a) Introduction. Development Policy Plan recommendations for the Lodi Planning Area include recommendations for future development of the Village of Lodi and the key areas of Harrisville Township which surrounds Lodi. These recommendations were originally developed by the Lodi Planning Commission with assistance from the staff of the Medina County Regional Planning Commission after a review of the characteristics of the Lodi Planning Area pertinent to the development of a guide for future growth in 1978. Existing development, the natural features of the land, the relationship of the planning area to the Cleveland and Akron Metropolitan Areas, and the advice of local officials were analyzed in developing plan recommendations. A total review of these recommendations was completed in 1992 and the same are set forth below.
The following recommendations are a summary of the final land use recommendations of the Lodi Planning Commission. These final recommendations are the result of several meetings during which a draft land use policy plan map was discussed and modified. At the same time, a draft zoning districts map was discussed and modified also.
In the following text, a footnote with an "A" references a modification to the draft land use policy plan map, while a footnote with a "B" references a modification to the draft zoning districts map. A summary of these referenced modifications is provided in Appendix A following the text of this chapter.
26
These modifications are reflected in the generalized Village of Lodi Development Policy Plan Map (one inch equals 1,000 feet) at the end of this chapter, and the more detailed Map (one inch equals 400 feet) on file at the Village Hall.

PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.06
(b) General Concepts of the Lodi Policy Plan. The Development Policy Plan embodies the objective of maintaining the small town atmosphere in the Village of Lodi, while providing appropriate urban services to urbanizing areas at the periphery of the Village in a planned, orderly fashion. Residential development is proposed in a range of densities, each density based on existing residential development, the suitability of the land for development, and the efficiency with which services can be provided. Several varieties of commercial development are proposed at locations convenient to the market area the commercial activities would serve. Locations for industrial development are recommended based on existing industrial development, pending development, availability of transportation facilities, the potential availability of water and sewer facilities, and the suitability of land for industrial growth. The following subsections describe the plan proposals in more detail.
(c) Open Space and Planned Development Areas. Areas described in the Lodi Development Policy Plan as Open Space Areas include lands which, because of their unique natural characteristics and severe physical limitations for development, should remain predominantly open. Low land susceptible to flooding or having soils which are saturated most of the year are appropriate in the open space category. The lands bordering the East Fork and the West Fork of the Black River, Clear Creek and Little Killbuck Creek are examples of areas which should experience very limited development. Also, much of the land on both sides of Garden Isle Road should experience only very limited development due to the marshy conditions and due to the land's high value for agricultural purposes. Lands having slopes of fifteen to twenty percent and over also pose significant problems for development. These areas, including land along the East Fork of the Black River and a portion of the drainage area west of Harris Road, are recommended as open space areas.
Open space areas should be used for extensive recreational activity (e.g. wooded parks, trails, golf courses), agriculture and selective planned larger lot residential development.
(d) Rural Residential Areas. The area surrounding the Village of Lodi is predominately agricultural or vacant, with scattered single-family residential development. As shown on the Development Policy Plan Map, this general area surrounding the Village should develop at a density of at least one dwelling unit (DU) per two acres. This scale of development is also recommended in the Medina County Development Policy (adopted December 4, 1975) which states that in the rural agricultural or rural residential western portion of the County "... in all but unique cases, residential lot
27
sizes of two acres or perhaps considerably more should be required." At this density, individual lot sizes are large enough so that individual
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.06
septic systems and wells will be adequate for the indefinite future should the designated rural density areas fully develop. In addition, development at this density will not create an unmanageable demand on Harrisville Township's road system in the foreseeable future.
With present knowledge and the resulting expectations, encouraging the maintenance of a rural character of development in the general area surrounding the Village of Lodi seems desirable. The Lodi Planning Area is not affected by the Cleveland or Akron Metropolitan Area to the extent of Brunswick, Medina or Wadsworth Cities. As a result, development pressures will not be as intense as in the northern and eastern portion of Medina County. It is appropriate, therefore, that the general area surrounding the Village of Lodi retain its rural/agricultural pattern of development.
(e) Urban Service Low Density Residential Areas. This recommended residential land use category consists of land that is, or can be, served with central sewer, water and storm drainage facilities from the Village of Lodi. In addition, these areas are accessible to highways which can accommodate traffic that could be expected from residential development at urban densities. The density of development recommended for these urban service low density residential areas is one to three DU per acre. (A-l)
Four general areas in the Lodi Planning Area are recommended for this lower density residential development, as follows:
(1) An area between Prospect Street/Redfield Street and Harris Road. This area,
which is partially developed in single-family homes, has fairly irregular topography and has a high potential for additional attractive home sites. Several streets currently dead-end at the eastern end of the site. A steeply-sloped gully runs north/south along the eastern end of the site.
(2) Selected areas on the periphery of the Village. These areas are suitable for low-
density residential development due to their distance from local shopping facilities and services provided in the central area of the Village. In addition, they are an appropriate transition area between outlying areas and the denser development near the core of the Village.
(3) An area north of the Hospital on both sides of Elyria Street. (A-2)
(4) An area north of the N & W railroad tracks on the west side of the Village. This
area was proposed for development as part of an application to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1977. (A-3)
28
1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.06
It can be anticipated that residential development in the above areas will consist of single-family homes. However, the potential exists for planned development which incorporates areas of open space or unique natural features as an integral component of the development. In particular, portions of the currently undeveloped area east of Prospect and Redfield Streets could develop in such a fashion carefully integrating the steeply-sloped gully area paralleling Harris Road as an open space component and accessible to persons living in the general area.
(f) Urban Service Medium Density Residential Areas. The medium density residential area comprises most of the existing residential area in the central portion of the Village and includes an area on the north side of Highland Avenue in the northeast portion of the Planning Area. An additional medium density residential area is proposed in the northeast area of the Lodi Planning Area served by Redfield Street, Vandemark Road, Medina Street and Buffham Road. The recommended density of development for these areas is from three to six dwelling units per acre (A-4). It can be anticipated that future residential development in these areas may consist of a mix of single-family and two-family units. As with the Urban Service Low Density Residential Areas, potential exists for larger scale planned unit developments which might incorporate clustered units of single-family homes or duplexes with selected open space areas, while still keeping the overall development densities at a relatively low level.
As indicated on the Lodi Development Policy Plan Map, urban service medium density residential areas are located with easy access to existing or proposed general and local commercial areas, thereby clustering higher density development in a relatively compact area.
(g) Urban Service High Density Residential Areas. The area on the west side of the junction of Medina Street and Redfield Street is proposed for high density residential development. Portions of this area have already been developed as mobile home parks. The recommended density for this area is from six to twelve dwelling units per acre (A-5). (For mobile home development the recommended density is six to eight dwelling units per acre.) With careful site planning, incorporating open space/recreation areas, this density of development can be accommodated. This area is easily accessible to shopping facilities and police and fire protection services, and is adequately buffered from adjacent development which may occur locally in the future.
29
A high density residential area is proposed along the south side of Highland Drive in the vicinity of the existing water tower. An existing apartment development is located on this site. Like the previously mentioned high density residential site, this area is close to shopping and other local services. Natural buffers should be provided between this high density area and the lower density residential area to the south.
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.06
Finally, a high density area is proposed for eventual development north of the N & W tracks north of Lee Drive on the west side of the Village. This area was proposed for development as part of an application to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
(h) Central Commercial Area. The central commercial area in the Village of Lodi is really the core or heart of the Lodi Planning Area. Most of the area consists of existing businesses with several interspersed dwelling units. This commercial center provides a business and shopping area of significance for southwestern Medina County and portions of Wayne and Ashland Counties. Concentrations of comparison shopping facilities, financial and business services, personal services and entertainment facilities should be encouraged here.
Care needs to be taken in this area in developing regulations designed to facilitate pedestrian movement and to enhance the Village's small-town atmosphere. The Lodi Planning Commission has indicated that Central Park in the downtown area should remain the focal point for the Village.
(i) Local Commercial Areas. The purpose of this type of development in the Lodi Planning Area is to provide for uses principally to accommodate the sale of convenience retail goods and personal services purchased frequently for daily or weekly needs. It is intended that the design of these commercial areas will encourage groupings of establishments located on a unified site providing adequate off-street parking facilities as well as efficient and safe vehicular and pedestrian access. These areas are intended to serve primarily residents of the Lodi area, rather than a regional market.
In addition to existing local commercial areas, several other local commercial areas are suggested on the Lodi Development Policy Plan Map, including the following:
(1) A small area located at the intersection of Bank Street and West Drive. This
area is currently developed in mixed light manufacturing and commercial uses. Because it is adjacent to a high density residential area on Sunset Street, the best use for this land is probably as a commercial center, rather than for manufacturing uses. As Lodi develops residentially to the north along West Drive, a cluster of carefully designed personal service and retail shops at the above intersection would be of significant value.
30
(2) The roughly triangular parcel of land on the south side of Bank Street
between Sunset Street and Archer Street. This parcel includes a marshy area that should not be developed. Existing uses are commercial and residential.
1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.06
(3) An area along the south side of Bank Street from Archer Street east to the N
& W railroad tracks which currently is developed in mixed residential and
commercial uses. Also, the area on the north side of Bank Street from the
east boundary of the Mabry property to the east boundary of the Mong
property near the railroad (B-6).
(4) The area on the north side of Wooster Street from Market Street east to
approximately the intersection with Greenwich Road, including the small
triangle formed by S.R. 83, Harris Road and Wooster Street. Access to the
developing residential area to the north from Wooster Street should be
reserved through this commercial area. Also, an area of land from the west
side of Richman Field to the east side of the Donald Dearth property is
designated for eventual commercial use. (B-7)
(5) The area of the intersection of Buffham Road, Medina Street and Redfield
Street. This is a key area for carefully planned commercial development in
that significant residential growth is occurring and planned in this northeast
quadrant of the Lodi Planning Area. Several commercial uses already exist
in the area. Without careful controls, however, this area could develop into a
hazardous, unattractive area.
(j) Light Industrial Areas. The purpose of this land use is to accommodate light industrial uses such as repair, storage, manufacturing, processing, wholesaling and distribution, free from the encroachment of nonindustrial uses. The uses allowed are those which, because of their normally unobjectionable characteristics, can be in relatively close proximity to residential, retail and institutional uses.
Several areas are suggested as light industrial districts in the Lodi Planning Area, as follows:
(1) The general southern area of the Village. Expansion could occur to the south
toward New Archer Street.
(2) An area in the southeast section of the Lodi Planning Area in the vicinity of
S.R. 83, Harris Road, Greenwich Road and the B & O railroad tracks. An
31
existing light manufacturing plant on the site has potential for limited
expansion to the southeast towards Harris Road.
(k) Heavy Industrial Areas. The purpose of this land use is to provide for certain manufacturing, assembling and fabricating activities, including large scale or specialized industrial operations which generate large volumes of truck or rail traffic. These activities have external physical characteristics which will significantly affect surrounding areas.
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.06
(1) Two areas are designated for heavy industrial use in the Lodi Planning
Area, as follows:
A. An existing heavy industrial area east of Garden Isle Road, north of
the old Nickel Plate railroad tracks, and a small section south of the
tracks. The remaining area south of the railroad tracks is poorly
drained with muck soils evident.
B. The general area west of Billman Street to West Dr.
(2) The area south of the Village, surrounded almost entirely by the B & O
and N & W railroad tracks, has soils with severe limitations for industrial
use and fire equipment access problems, and is therefore recommended to
remain undeveloped. The area is currently farmed.
(3) The above recommendations for industrial land are based on a detailed
analysis of fifty potential sites in the Lodi Planning Area. Sites were rated
against the following set of industrial development factors:
A. Site configuration.
B. Topography.
C. Soils.
D. Flooding potential.
E. Air and water pollution impact potential.
F. Sewer and water potential.
G. Proximity to major transportation corridors.
H. Existing land use/adjacent land use.
I. Existing natural cover.
J. Unique physical features.
(l) Highway Improvements.
(1) The Lodi Development Policy Plan Map specifies two major
improvements to roads in the Lodi Planning Area that should be
32
considered in the near future. These improvements include:
A. Construction of a north-south collector street serving the
eastern portion of the Village. Several east-west local streets
currently dead-end in this area.
B. As discussed earlier, fire equipment access to present industries
in the Ohio Street area could be delayed by trains using the N
& W tracks across Bank Street. There is not apparent short-
term, inexpensive solution to this problem. Providing access to land
north of Ohio Street across the N & W tracks at Ohio Street will
compound the accessibility problem for fire equipment.
1992 Replacement
33
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.06
C. Consideration should be given to analyzing the potential of
providing emergency access to this site from the property on the
north side of Bank Street adjacent to the N & W tracks. A second
alternative would be to provide emergency access to this site off
Richman Road parallel to and north of the N & W Tracks. A third
alternative is the extension of Railroad Street north and west
eventually to Richman Road to open up this land area. These access
provisions should be considered in conjunction with the eventual
elimination of truck traffic in the Ohio Street area. It is suggested
that Billman Street be connected with Bank Street to provide a
new truck access to the existing and future industries in this area.
(3) Other areas for future transportation analysis include congestion in the area of the intersections of Medina and Redfield Streets south along Medina Street to the entrance to Woodlawn Cemetery. As commercial and residential growth occurs in this section of the Lodi Planning Area, consideration will need to be given to signalizing this intersection and adding turn lanes on Medina Street to reduce congestion from turning traffic.
(4) Additional improvements may be necessary in the near future in two
areas proposed for clustered commercial development:
A. The developing area along Wooster Street in the vicinity of the
Emerald Health Care office. If the proposed collector street is
built to the north and if additional businesses locate along the
north side of Wooster Street, an additional turning lane would
alleviate potential congestion. Also, traffic hazards may increase
at the intersection of S.R. 83 and Greenwich Road to the point where
signalization may be necessary as a safety measure. Access drives to
businesses in this area will need to be carefully located to minimize
potential site distance problems, especially in the vicinity of the
intersection of S.R. 83 and Greenwich Road.
B. The proposed local commercial area on the south side of Bank
Street east of Sunset Street. Additional commercial development
in this area may create a need for an additional turn lane. The
congestion problem may be compounded if the proposed industrial
access road is considered off the north side of Bank Street north to
Billman Street.
(4) Special attention needs to be given to establishing a proper street
classification system (see Section 1212.01(b)(4)). Currently, the Lodi
Subdivision Regulations classify only local and cul-de-sac streets.
1992 Replacement
34
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.06
Major arterials and collector streets need to be considered for future addition
to the existing street classification system. The suggested street classification
system for existing streets is as follows:
A. Limited access thoroughfare - U.S. 224 and 42.
B. Major arterials - S.R. 83 (Elyria Street and Wooster Street);
S.R. 421 (Medina Street and Bank Street).
C. Collector streets - Prospect Street/Redfield Street; Railroad
Street/Academy Street; Garden Isle Road, Buffham Road; Harris
Road (C.H. 149), Richman Road (C.H. 69).
D. Local streets - All remaining existing streets in the Village of Lodi
(5) Growth can be more effectively managed by coordinating this local
thoroughfare plan/street classification system with appropriate land uses
as suggested in Section 1212.01, the Zoning Code and the Subdivision
Regulations.
(m) Community Facilities.
(1) Local and regional parks.
A. Four major areas for expansion of Lodi's existing park system are
recommended. As discussed in an earlier section of this chapter,
Lodi has approximately one-half the recommended acreage for
public outdoor recreation areas. This shortfall can be alleviated
through public acquisition of land in the following general areas:
1. Rugged topography and dense woods make the drainage area
west of Harris Road a suitable location for a neighborhood
park serving the residential area developing to the east.
2. Extension of Lodi's Community Park to the northeast, to
roughly surround the mobile home park area developing off
Medina and Redfield Streets, is recommended.
3. Potentially, a linear park following the drainage area of the
East Branch of the Black River north to Letha House Park (part
of the Medina County Park District System) could be
established through a phased development program, involving
local, State and/or Federal cooperation.
4. A potential linear park following the East Branch of the Black River, serving the area proposed for residential development in a recent application to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, is recommended.

PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.07
B. As part of the subdivision review process, special consideration
should be given to requiring that land be set aside from well-
designed recreation areas, tot lots or playgrounds. These types of
recreation areas would be most appropriate in existing or new
higher density residential areas (including mobile home parks).
(2) Fire and police protection. As noted in the analysis of existing public services,
the southwest quadrant of the Lodi Planning Area, where industry is concentrated, can be cut off from direct fire protection service in the event a train is crossing the N & W railroad tracks at Bank Street. Fire equipment in these circumstances must travel north on S.R. 421, west of U.S. 224 and 42, south on Richman Road and east on Bank Street to reach a fire. One alternative to consider is the construction of a fire substation on Bank Street west of the N & W tracks to serve this section of the Lodi Planning Area.
(3) Village Hall. The current facility is in an ideal central location to serve the
residents of the Lodi Planning Area. Handicap access is limited to the entrance to the Police Department and the Council Chambers.
1212.07 IMPLEMENTING THE LODI DEVELOPMENT POLICY PLAN.
(a) All areas of Medina County are facing development pressures which are scattering urban-type land use over the landscape, a little bit at a time; for the most part, on a lot by lot basis along existing roads. The rural atmosphere is thereby being obliterated bit by bit, and we are creating the need for public health and welfare related services and facilities in the most expensive and inefficient way. The changes and demands that population increases create need to be continuously identified and analyzed by the Lodi Planning Commission in its efforts to guide land use in the Village.
(b) The Development Policy Plan is one of many tools that can be used by Village officials and citizens in the land use planning process. It is important in making development decisions that the community officials realize the difference between a plan and the planning process. A plan is usually thought of as a definite course of action which may be set out in formalized policy statements, a map of future land use and public improvements, a definite program of capital improvement, or an actual budget for capital improvements. These plans all vary in the degree of specificity with which they treat local problems. With the exception of the goals and objectives statements, they all have a static character which, if misunderstood, can lead to problems in the use of plans as working tools in the decision-making process of government. A plan embodies judgments of what is one desirable future development pattern for an area and what public improvements and regulations are necessary to achieve that pattern. However sound these judgments may be, they nevertheless are made at a given point in time with imperfect knowledge of the cause and effect relationships of the past and only educated projections of the nature of future events. Consequently, a plan cannot account for all contingencies.
36
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.07
Competing interests in the community and events that affect the community but which are beyond its powers of control will result in a need to alter the plan at periodic intervals so that it may remain a realistic development guide. This is not to say that the plan should not be a strong development guide; it is vital to accept the plan as a firm but adaptable tool. Too often a plan is viewed as an inflexible course of action which is an effective tool only so long as no deviations from it occur. Such an attitude will lead to the plan being discarded as no longer realistic when deviations from the plan recommendations do take place.
(c) The approach that must be developed is to treat the Lodi Development Policy Plan as a tool in a continuing planning process. Planning should be a philosophy of approaching problems and of considering the broad spectrum of short-range and long-range development implications of every change in legislation, every public improvement and every proposed private development subject to review by Lodi officials. Treating planning as an integral part of all decisions is one of the most significant contributions officials can make in creating a community that can be transmitted with pride to succeeding generations. Future residents of Lodi will be affected by development decisions made today. A systematic and rational approach to public decisions affecting community development in the Lodi area must be taken. The Lodi Development Policy Plan, which should be revised periodically, should serve as a guide for making development decisions. It should be looked upon as a reference point against which the desirability of alternatives to plan recommendations and innovations in land development can be evaluated. When specific development proposals occur that do not coincide with Lodi Development Policy Plan recommendations, a number of questions should be asked by officials responsible for guiding land development, as follows:
(1) Does the specific proposal differ only in detail from Lodi
Development Policy Plan proposals and substantially conform to the
concepts and relationships guiding the Lodi Development Policy Plan in
reference to topography, adequacy of roads, soils, existing and proposed
land use, and community goals and objectives?
(2) Would the realization of the proposal work toward the goals of the Lodi
area? Have the perceived objectives of the community changed
since preparation of the Lodi Development Policy Plan?
(3) What would be the possible detriment to the Lodi area as a result of
the specific development? Would the desirable attributes of the
development outweigh the undesirable?
(4) Are the public improvements and utilities necessary to the proposed
development available, or can they be made available without placing
an undue burden on Lodi's financial resources?
37
1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.07
(5) Have marketing considerations or unexpected trends in the rate or
type of development made Lodi Development Policy Plan
recommendations unrealistic or undesirable?
(6) Is the proposed departure from the plan a precedent that is desirable
for Lodi in view of the possibility of similar proposals in the future?
(7) Is the proposal desirable from an overall land planning standpoint,
both in a short-range and a long-range sense?
(8) Have the many side effects of the proposed development on the Lodi
area been considered, objective advice sought, and opinions gathered
from residents? Does the proposed development continue to seem to
be an asset to the community and sufficient reason to amend the Lodi
Development Policy Plan?
If the answer to these questions in each case is "YES" then the flexibility of the Lodi Development Policy Plan probably should be recognized. The most important point is that indiscriminate departures from the Lodi Development Policy Plan with no evaluation of overall consequences should be avoided. Again, the vital considerations in approaching land development decisions are:
(1) To take a comprehensive approach to community development in the Lodi
area, whereby the many implications of one development on other systems in the community can be evaluated, and
(2) To treat planning as a continuing process rather than an activity that begins
and ends with a "program" or a "project."
(d) Other tools besides the Lodi Development Policy Plan are available to the Lodi Planning Commission in its land use planning efforts. These include those tools and powers that are currently available for use and those that could be initiated in the future, as follows:
(1) Lodi Zoning Code and Subdivision Regulations. In conjunction
with the Lodi Development Policy Plan, these two tools are the key
to the arrangement and quality of future land uses in the Village. It
is through Lodi's Zoning Code and Subdivision Regulations that
recommendations contained within the Lodi Development Policy Plan
can be implemented by requiring, for example, that a collector street
right of way be dedicated by a subdivision developer or that a proposed
commercial development be located only in an appropriate section of
38
the Village.
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.07
Special notes should be made here of the administrative zoning responsibilities of the Planning Commission and Zoning Inspector vs. the legislative zoning responsibilities of the Village Council.
Section 713.11 of the Ohio Revised Code states "... the legislative authority of a municipal corporation may create an administrative board to administer the details of the application of the regulations …and may delegate to such board . . . the power to hear and determine appeals . . . (and) to permit exceptions to and variation from the district regulations." In other words, the Village Council, being a law-making body, is ultimately responsible for enacting (or establishing) the local zoning ordinance and approving any amendments or rezonings which may be proposed, whereas the Village Planning Commission is responsible for implementing the ordinance. The Lodi Planning Commission has been charged with the responsibilities of
(1) administering the Zoning Code and
(2) acting a as a board of zoning appeals.
The Planning Commission is also responsible for the issuance of conditional use permits.
The Lodi Planning Commission, acting as a board of zoning appeals, has powers very similar to those of the courts. Under the Ohio Revised Code, the Board of Zoning Appeals is given three basic powers:
A. To hear and decide appeals;
B. To grant variances; and
C. To grant conditional zoning permits.
Appeals and variances only go to the Board of Zoning Appeals upon appeal by an applicant, whereas the Board of Zoning Appeals is directly presented applications for conditional uses.
It is recommended, however, in the State of Ohio's Model Zoning Regulations, that the Board of Zoning Appeals be composed of different individuals from the Planning Commission. If the Planning Commission does function as the Board of Zoning Appeals, separate records must be maintained.
The duties of the Zoning Inspector, designated by the Mayor, lie in the administration and enforcement of zoning. As with the Planning Commission, the Inspector's duties are administrative only. These responsibilities do not include
39
determining whether conditions of the law, such as density, land use, etc., are or are not proper. These are legislative responsibilities.
1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.07
The Zoning Inspector is the key individual in the administration of zoning. He or she is the person the public will most directly associate with zoning. Also, the Inspector's work is essential in the fair and impartial enforcement of the regulations of the Zoning Code
(2) Housing Code. The purpose of a housing code is to correct existing
unsafe or substandard housing conditions and to prevent future
deterioration due to improper maintenance. Housing codes may apply
retroactively to existing dwelling units. The Village of Lodi may
benefit from the adoption of a housing code.
(3) Federal and State Assistance.
(a) A vast array of Federal and State programs are available for
potential funding of many kinds of local improvement projects.
These Federal and State programs often are in the form of grants-
in-aid whereby the Federal and/or State government provides a
grant or loan, for a portion or share of the project cost, and the local
community shares the remaining cost of the project.
Federal and/or State funding for projects is rarely for an
extended period of time. Usually, funding is provided for initial (or
front-end) costs of a project, with the local community expected to
pay the long-term cost of operating the project. Caution must be
exercised by a local community not to over-extend itself in these
types of projects which have hidden long- term costs. The State of
Ohio has a broad range of financing tools available for local
community improvements, including the following:
1. Community improvement corporations. A community
improvement corporation (CIC) is a nonprofit corporation
organized for the sole purpose of advancing, encouraging and
promoting the industrial, economic, commercial and civic
development of a community or area. A CIC can serve as
the conduit through which tax-exempt public financing is
made available to private enterprise. The Ohio Revised Code
invests CIC's with a wide range of powers. Such a corporation
may borrow money, issue bonds and secure them, make
loans, acquire, lease and otherwise dispose of real and
personal property and other assets, acquire real estate,
40
acquire, construct, operate, lease and dispose of industrial
plants or business establishments, acquire and dispose of
stock, etc., and mortgage or otherwise encumber property it
acquires.
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.07
A CIC may also become a member or a stockholder of an
Ohio development corporation formed under Ohio R.C.
Chapter 1726. By resolution or ordinance, any political
subdivision (or combination of subdivisions) may designate a
CIC as the agency of the subdivision(s) for industrial,
commercial, distribution and research development, and may
enter into an agreement with the CIC to provide for such
development.
2. Nonprofit corporations. A nonprofit corporation may be
formed for any purpose or purposes for which natural persons
lawfully may associate themselves. The law defines
"nonprofit corporation" as a corporation which is not formed
for the pecuniary gain or profit of its members, trustees,
officers or other private persons, and whose net earnings or
any part thereof is not distributable to them. In general the
authority of nonprofit corporations, subject to limitations
prescribed by law or in its articles of incorporation, includes
the following powers: to take property by gift, devise or
bequest; to make donations for charitable and other purposes;
to acquire, use, lease and dispose of property; to form or
acquire control of other corporations, whether nonprofit or
for profit; to become a member of another corporation; to
borrow money and to issue bonds, etc., and to secure such
obligations; to invest its idle funds; and to do all things
permitted by law and to exercise its authority in this State and
elsewhere. Historically, nonprofit corporations have
provided valuable benefits and services to many
communities. For example, numerous low and moderate-
income housing developments throughout Ohio are a direct
result of nonprofit sponsorship. For a variety of development
and redevelopment projects, the nonprofit corporation may
serve as a highly advantageous tool when used in various
combinations with more specialized organizations.
3. Ohio Development Financing Commission. The Ohio
Development Financing Commission was established by
statute to promote the welfare of the people of the State, to
41
stabilize the economy, to provide employment, and to assist
in the development within the State of industrial, commercial,
distribution and research activities required for the people of
the State and for their gainful employment.
1992 Replacement
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1212.07
The Commission is empowered to insure revenue bonds of
the State and to receive grants, gifts and contributions for
such purpose. It may also acquire property of any kind for its
purposes, and may maintain, repair, improve, insure and
dispose of such property by sale, exchange or lease.
Funds obtained from the sale of revenue bonds issued or
from other sources may be lent to community improvement
corporations (CIC), to Ohio development corporations (ODC)
and to other corporations, partnerships and persons for
procuring and/or improving real property and for
establishing, locating or expanding industrial, commercial,
distribution research facilities in Ohio. The Commission may
also make loans to a CIC or ODC for the purpose of loaning
funds to other corporations, partnerships and other persons
for the same purposes. The Commission loan may not exceed
fifty percent of the total amount to be expended.
The Commission may also lend its funds to any political
subdivision of the State for the purposes of expediting the
creation, location or expansion of industrial, commercial,
distribution or research facilities by the construction or
installation of eligible public improvements (streets, water
lines) and by land acquisition for such purposes. In addition,
a political subdivision intending to borrow Commission
funds may agree with a CIC, an ODC, a partnership, an
individual, another corporation, or any combination thereof,
to construct any one or more of the improvements for which
funds are to be borrowed in return for a satisfactory
commitment.
The Commission is further authorized to insure
up to ninety percent of the mortgage payments required by a
first mortgage on any project for which a CIC has loaned
funds or upon which it has borrowed funds.
4. Ohio development corporations. An Ohio development
corporation (ODC) is basically comprised of member
financial institutions formed for the purposes of promoting,
aiding, developing and advancing industrial and business
ventures, cooperating with other organizations to promote
42
agricultural, industrial and business developments, and
lending funds for the carrying on and development of
business or industrial undertakings.
1992 Replacement
Lodi Development Policy Plan 1212.07
Essentially, an ODC is empowered to borrow money for any
of its corporate purposes and to issue bonds, etc., therefore;
to make loans; to acquire real estate for construction of
plants or businesses; to acquire, operate, lease, sell, etc.,
plants or business establishments; to acquire, sell, mortgage,
etc., bonds and other securities; and to mortgage, pledge or
otherwise encumber any property acquired. ODC members
make loans to the corporation itself as and when called upon
to do so on a prorated basis according to prescribed loan
limits. Such loans are evidenced by bonds or other such
evidence of the corporation and bear interest at not less than
one-quarter of one percent above the current prime rate.

Community Development, P.O. Box 1001, Columbus, Ohio 43216.

1224.01 CLASSIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF
SUBDIVISION TYPES.
There are two basic types of subdivisions:
51
(a) Minor Subdivision. The Platting Commission may determine that a proposed
subdivision of land is a minor subdivision if the proposed division of a parcel of land is along an existing public street, does not involve the opening, widening or extension of any street or road, and does not involve more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided.
(b) Major Subdivision. Any subdivision that does not meet the requirements of a
minor subdivision is a major subdivision.
1224.02 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
(a) Authority of Review and Approval. The Platting Commission may review and approve a minor subdivision and to endorse the conveyance of a parcel or parcels of land in a minor subdivision for transfer without plat.
(b) Submission of Minor Subdivision. Any person proposing to create a minor subdivision shall submit the following to the Platting Commission:
(1) A legal description, of the parcel or parcels sought to be transferred, on a
conveyance of said parcel or parcels.
(2) Two copies of a property line survey, by a registered surveyor, of the
parcel or parcels sought to be transferred.
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1224.03
(c) Action by Platting Commission. Within thirty calendar days after submission of a minor subdivision or within a mutually agreed upon extension, the Platting Commission shall either approve or disapprove the application for transfer with plat. If the Platting Commission approves the transfer without plat, the conveyance shall be stamped: "Approved by Village of Lodi Platting Commission; no plat required," and the signature of the Platting -Commission affixed along with the date of such approval. The approval shall expire at the end of sixty days, unless conveyances are recorded in the office of the County Recorder during such period.
1224.03 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
(a) General Procedure. Major subdivisions shall be approved in four stages: the preliminary discussion stage; the preliminary plan stage; the improvement plan stage; and the final plat stage.
(b) Submission of Preliminary Plan. The subdivider shall make application to the Platting Commission for approval of a preliminary plan. All information required by Section 1226.02 shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Platting Commission. Such information shall include:
(1) Two copies of an application for preliminary approval;
(2) One copy of the preliminary steps certification form; and
(3) Six copies of the preliminary plan, including a vicinity map.
52
(c) Transmission of Preliminary Plan. The Platting Commission shall file one copy of the preliminary plan and transmit a copy to the officials and agencies listed below for their review and recommendations. Prior to the Platting Commission meeting, a date on which the site will be viewed shall be established by the Platting Director. The officials and agencies listed below may be invited to attend this viewing along with the developer and his or her engineer.
(1) The Platting Commission and the appropriate Council committee.
(2) The Village Engineer.
(3) The County Board of Health.

The action shall also be entered on the official records of the Platting Commission and a copy of the preliminary plan, with action noted, kept on file.
(e) Effect of Approval. Approval of a preliminary plan by the Platting Commission is not an acceptance of the subdivision for record. It is an approval of a general plan as a guide for the preparation of improvement plans and a subdivision plat for final approval and recording upon fulfillment of all requirements of these Regulations. Approval of a preliminary plan shall be effective for a period of one year following the date of approval by the Platting Commission, unless an extension of time is granted. Upon expiration of preliminary plan approval, no approval of a final plat shall be given until the preliminary plan has been resubmitted and approved. Construction of improvements shall not begin until action on the final plat has been taken.
(f) Submission of Improvement Plans. The developer's engineer shall prepare improvement plans which include all phases of the work to be performed to make the land suitable for development into the use proposed. These plans shall be complete and precise in all details and eight copies shall be submitted to the Platting Commission.
53
(g) Transmission of Improvement Plans. The Platting Commission shall file one copy of the improvement plans and transmit one copy to each of the officials and agencies listed below for their review and recommendations.

topography of the land to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction to
trees and topsoil. (Ord. 1729. Passed 1-3-90.)
(c) Bypass of Preliminary Plan Procedure. If, in the judgment of the Platting Commission, an applicant has substantially fulfilled all of the requirements set forth herein for preliminary plans, prior to the submission of a preliminary plan, then he or she may bypass the preliminary plan procedure set forth in these Subdivision Regulations and proceed with the final plan procedure as set forth in Sections 1226.03 and 1226.04.

Upon receipt of the Village Engineer's and Village Solicitor's certifications and determinations that all the requirements of these Regulations have been met, the Planning Commission may give final approval, and shall indicate such approval and the date thereof on the tracing of the final plat. The final plan shall then be submitted to Council for approval. A two-thirds vote of Council shall be required to override the recommendation of the Planning Commission. The Council shall endorse the subdivision by affixing the Clerk of Council's signature to the tracing of the final plat.
(3) If the owner desires protective covenants, private restriction and/or
agreements, the record plat shall contain a reference thereto and the
text thereof shall be filed and recorded with the plat.

1226.08 APPROVAL WITHOUT BOARD ACTION.
In the event the Platting Commission fails to approve or disapprove the final plat within forty-five days from the date of its official filing, or within a mutually-agreed upon time extension, the final plat shall be deemed to have been approved.
(Ord. 1729. Passed 1-3-90.)
Plat and Plan Specifications 1226.09
1226.09 EFFECT OF APPROVAL.
Final approval of a plat by the Platting Commission shall not be an acceptance by the public of an offer of dedication of any street, highway or other public way or open space upon the plat unless such acceptance is also endorsed by Council upon the tracing of the final plat.
(Ord. 1729. Passed 1-3-90.)
63
1226.10 RECORDING OF FINAL PLAT.
After the final approval of a plat by the Platting Commission, the subdivider shall deliver the tracing of such plat to the Mayor who, after rechecking and assigning a Village lot number, shall secure approval of the Tax Map Department in the County Recorder's Office.

agreement provided for herein and shall also file with the Clerk a full
construction performance bond or an irrevocable bank letter of credit in an
amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvements which he or she has

additional amount shall provide for any margin of error in estimation and shall

approval by the Village. The bond itself shall be a cash bond, a surety bond
executed by the subdivider and a corporate surety or an irrevocable bank letter

Before the inspection is made, the subdivider shall cause the sanitary sewers, storm sewers and the surface of the pavement and walk to be cleaned. The Village shall require the replacement of any defective work or materials or of any walk that has been damaged within said eighteen-month maintenance period. When the Village finds that any defects in workmanship or materials which might have developed within said eighteen-month maintenance period have been properly corrected and that other obligations of the bond have been satisfied, it shall notify the subdivider that the bond may be released, and the Village shall assume all maintenance thereafter.
(h) Bond or Irrevocable Bank Letter of Credit Forfeiture.

The money that is collected from the financial guarantee shall be used for no other purpose, except that the Village may charge ten percent in addition to the cost of improvements for administrative overhead, and any money remaining after the completion of the work shall be returned to the original depositor.
73
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1230.12

B. That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Code.
C. That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the

applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Code
to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district. A
variance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific
findings of fact, based directly on the particular evidence presented
to it, which support conclusions that the standards and conditions
imposed by paragraph (b)(4) hereof have been met by the applicant.

1276.01 PURPOSE.
The regulations of this chapter are intended to protect and further the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Village of Lodi; to maintain and improve the appearance of the community; to conserve community character; to prevent traffic hazards; to provide safe conditions for pedestrians; and to promote economic development by regulating the construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, size, location and number of signs. It is further determined that to allow signs of excessive number and size in the Village would unduly distract pedestrians and motorists, create traffic hazards and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. The regulations of this chapter are intended to provide reasonable identification for businesses and other uses within the community; but are not intended to serve as a means of advertising.

1278.01 PURPOSE.
The functions and characteristics of an increasing number of new kinds of land uses, combined with conclusive experience regarding some of the older, familiar kinds of uses, call for a more flexible and equitable procedure for properly accommodating these activities in the community. It should be recognized that the forces that influence decisions regarding the nature, magnitude and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied, and are dependent upon the functional characteristics of the use, competitive situations and the availability of land. Certain kinds of uses need to be reasonably controlled by specific requirements that provide practical latitude for the investor but, at the same time, maintain adequate provision for the security of the health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity or general welfare of the community's inhabitants.
In order to accomplish such a dual objective, provision is made in this chapter for a more detailed consideration of each conditionally permitted use as it relates to location, design, size, method of operation and intensity of land use, which, in turn, affects the volume of traffic generated and traffic movements, the concentration of population, and the kinds of public facilities and services required. Land and structure uses possessing these particularly unique characteristics are designated as "conditionally permitted uses" and are permitted through the issuance of a conditional zoning certificate, with conditions and safeguards attached as may be deemed necessary for the protection of the public welfare.

191
It is the intent of this Section to recognize and permit in a uniform manner the use of creative and imaginative residential development techniques that are in the best interests of the Village.
(a) In order to accomplish this purpose, it is the intent in establishing this
subsection to achieve:
(1) A variety of dwelling types including single-family and multiple-family dwellings compatible with the purposes of planned unit developments (PUDs)
(2) Flexible spacing of lots and buildings in order to encourage;
A. The preservation of the natural character of the land;
B. The separation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation;
C. The conservation of natural amenities of the landscape;
D. The provision of readily accessible recreation areas and green
spaces.
E. The creation of functional and interesting residential areas; and
F. The availability of a greater variety of housing types.
(3) In large-scale PUDS, suitable associated commercial and other
nonresidential uses consistent with demand created by the PUD and
compatible with existing and proposed land uses adjacent to the PUD.
(4) A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development, resulting in substantial savings through
shorter utility lines and streets.
(b) Special provisions governing PUDS. Because of the special characteristics of planned unit developments, special provisions governing the development of the land for this purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this section and those of the other chapters of the zoning codes, the provisions of this Section shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this Section shall be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this Code. Except as specially noted, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to exempt PUDs from all provisions of the Subdivision Regulations of the Village. All PUDS are subject to site plan review by the Planning Commission.
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1278.04
192
(c) Uses. With an approved PUD, compatible residential, commercial, institutional and open space uses may be combined as it will enhance the living environment of the planned development. All such uses shall be arranged to be compatible with each other and not to adversely affect adjacent property and/or the public health, safety and general welfare.

Such uses should be limited to five percent of the total PUD area and shall be limited to uses, such as schools, churches and cultural facilities, judged appropriate by the Planning Commission and compatible with the predominantly residential nature of a PUD. Institutional uses shall be further controlled by the standard in subsection (k) (1) and (2) hereof.
(d) Minimum project area:
(1) The gross area of a tract of land to be developed in a PUD shall be a minimum of twenty-five acres. Smaller parcels may be considered for approval as a PUD on the basis of their potential to meet objectives of this Section as stated in Subsection 1278.04(a).
(2) All land within the PUD shall be contiguous in that it shall not be divided into segments by:
(A) any limited access highway, or
(B) any tract of land (other than streets or rights-of-way for pipelines

Approval by the Planning Commission of such instruments shall be based on the following standards:
(1) The instruments shall guarantee that open space as shown on the final
development plan will remain as such. The Planning Commission may
require that all development rights to the open space be deeded to The
Village if the Village Council will accept said deed or deeded to
another appropriate public body, or that permanent restrictive
covenants be attached to the open space.
(2) Common open space and recreation facilities shall be deeded to the
homeowners association, funded community trust or similar entity. If

governmental bodies the right of entrance to the common open space
and recreation facilities for emergency purposes or in the event
nonperformance of maintenance or improvements affecting the public
interest. Such governments shall have the right, after proper notice
under applicable law enforcement ordinances, to make improvements
and perform maintenance functions if the cost levied as a lien against
the property if such a lien may lawfully be levied. Advanced notice is
not necessary for emergency entrance onto such common areas and
facilities.

1282.01 FINDING OF FACT.
(a) The Village of Lodi has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
(b) Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1282.02
1282.02 PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
(a) Protect human life and health;
(b) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control project;
(c) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
(f) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
(g) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
(h) Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near
flood prone areas;
207
(i) Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain are
maintained;
(j) Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values of the
floodplain;
(k) Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible;
(l) Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program.
1282.03 METHODES OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and provisions for:
(a) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or velocities;
(b) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(c) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
Flood Damage Prevention 1282.04
(d) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and,
(e) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
1282.04 DEFINITIONS
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them meaning they have in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
(a) Accessory Structure means a structure on the same lot with, and a natural
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principle structure.

Zoning Inspector’s interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a variance.
208
(c) Base Flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
(d) Base (100) Year Flood Elevation (BFE) means the water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3 feet).
(e) Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
(f) Development Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
(g) Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor See “Lowest Floor”
(h) Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
(i) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) means the agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1282.04
(j) Fill means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
(k) Flood or Flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(1) The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
(2) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
(l) Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate
special flood hazard areas.
(m) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood
hazard.
209
(n) Flood Insurance Risk Zones Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMS
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; elevations are determined.
Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
with flood depths of 1 to 3feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of 1 to 3feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Flood Damage Prevention 1282.04
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
(o) Flood Insurance Study (FIS) means the official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries
(sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and water
surface elevations of the base flood.
(p) Flood Protection Elevation The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
210
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
(q) Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge.
A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic
engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface
elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In
no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any point within
the community.
(r) Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave actions, obstructed bridge openings, debris
and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
(s) Historic Structure Any structure that is:
(1) Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listings on the National Register;
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1282.04
(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
(3) Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic places

(4) Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
Village of Lodi’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
(t) Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
211
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used
to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
(u) Letter of Map Change (LOMC) A letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMCs are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Flood Damage Prevention 1282.04
(v) Lowest Floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosure below the lowest floor.
(w)Manufactured Home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.
212
The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purpose of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(x) Manufactured Home Park As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge of for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
(y) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1282.04
(z) New Construction means structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Lodi
Floodplain Regulations, dated May 18, 1987, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
(aa) Person includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity, including state and local governments and agencies.

213
university, community college district, technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or any court.
(bb) Recreational Vehicle means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
(cc) Registered Professional Architect means a person registered to engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
(dd) Registered Professional Engineer means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
(ee) Registered Professional Surveyor means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
(ff) Special Flood Hazard Area Also known as “Area of Special Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soil associated with watercourse.
Flood Damage Prevention 1282.04
(gg) Start of Construction The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of
214
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

1282.34 VARIENCES FOR FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
(a) Any person believing that the use and development standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a variance.
(b) The Platting Commission shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship:
(1) Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is sought
shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the Village of
Lodi, at 108 Ainsworth Street, Lodi, Ohio 44254, who upon receipt of the
variance shall transmit it to the Platting Commission.
(2) Such application at a minimum shall contain the following information:
Name, Address, and Telephone Number of the applicant; Legal
232
Description of the Property; Parcel Map; Description of the Variance
sought; and Reason for the Variance request.
(c) At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and evidence as the Platting Commission requires. In considering such variance applications, the Platting Commission shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the following factors:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community.
Flood Damage Prevention 1282.34
(5) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(6) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.
(7) The compatibility of the purposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the purposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
(10) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site.
(11) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
233
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public
expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict
with existing local laws.
(4) A determination that the structure or other development is protected by
methods to minimize flood damages.
(5) A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.
PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 1282.35
(e) The Platting Commission shall also consider the following conditions for variances:
(1) Variances shall not be issued within any designated Floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(2) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, if Section 1282.34(c) (1)-(11) have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(f) Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations, any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be developed with such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. That person shall also be given written notice that the structure will be permitted with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
1282.35 ENFORCEMENT
234
(a) Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall give written notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order compliance with this Chapter and a reasonable time for performance.
(b) Notice shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner, occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to the person’s last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
(c) Violation of the provisions of this Chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense and shall constitute a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Any person who violates this Chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions of and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the Village of Lodi. Each day such violation continues, shall be considered a separate offense.
