to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF NORTH
BALTIMORE, WOOD COUNTY, OHIO:

Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

(ORC 1.42)

         B.   "Year" means twelve consecutive months.
            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is
closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for
doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may
be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.  If any legal holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a
legal holiday.
         (ORC 1.14)
      (4)   When legislation is to take effect or become operative from and
after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.
         (ORC 1.15)
      (5)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.

construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (e)   Joint Authority.  All words purporting to give joint authority to

such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall
be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.09  PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING MEMBERS OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.
   (a)   When a member of any public Board or Commission serving the citizens
of the Village is unable to attend a scheduled meeting of said board or
commission, said member shall notify the Chairman, or if the absent member is
the chairman, at least one other member of the board or commission, of his or
her inability to attend and request that he or she be excused.  Said notice or
request should be transmitted at the earliest possible time, but in no event
less than 24 hours before the scheduled meeting unless an emergency situation
causes the absence.
   (b)   Members who provide the required notice specified in subsection (a)
hereof shall be excused for not more than two consecutive meetings and may be
excused for additional meetings at the discretion of the remaining members.
   (c)   Members who fail to attend two consecutive meetings without being
excused may be removed from the Board or commission as follows:
      (1)   The remaining members of the board or commission, by majority vote,
shall make a request to the appointing authority whether that be the Mayor,
Village Council, or both, that the member who has failed to attend meetings be
replaced because of failure to attend at least two consecutive meetings without
being excused.
      (2)   At the next regular meeting of Village Council, the request for a
replacement member shall be acted upon by the Mayor, if he is the appointing
authority, or by Council by majority vote, if Council is the appointing
authority.
      (3)   A person shall be named to replace the removed member at the
Council meeting wherein the request was acted upon, or as soon thereafter as a

(Ord. 00-33.  Passed 9-5-00.)
135.06  INDIGENT BURIAL POLICY.
   As provided in Ohio R.C. 9.15, if the body of a deceased person is found in
any township in the County or in any municipality in the County, and it is
determined that said person was indigent and a legal resident of the Village of
North Baltimore immediately prior to his or her death; said person was not an
inmate of a correctional institution of the county or a patient or resident of
a benevolent institution of the county;  and no relative or friend of decedent
will claim the body for private burial; then the Village shall proceed as
follows:
   (a)   The Village Administrator shall first verify that said deceased person
was a legal resident of the Village and was indigent.  The Village
Administrator will develop a standard questionnaire form designed to establish
factually that the deceased person was, in fact, a legal resident of the
Village at his or her death and was indigent and without means or estate
resources to pay the cost of cremation and burial. Said form shall be completed
and signed by the person or persons asserting the claim that the Village is
legally responsible for the cost of cremation and burial.
   (b)   Once the Administrator is satisfied that the decedent was in fact
indigent and a legal resident of the Village and that the Village is
responsible for cremation and burial expenses, then, pursuant to Ohio R.C.
1713.34, the Village Administrator shall determine if said decedent died from
an infectious disease.  If said person did not die of an infectious disease,
the Administrator shall cause to be notified a Professor or other person in
charge of Anatomy or surgery instruction at the Medical College of Ohio, in
Toledo, and/or any other state chartered school or college authorized to teach
Anatomy or surgery and also shall notify the Secretary of the Board of
Embalmers and Funeral Directors of the State of Ohio (hereafter referred to
collectively as “the institution”); that a body of an indigent person who did
not die of an infectious disease, is being held by the Village and as required
by law, the Village will make said body available for anatomy study, surgical
study, or dissection, or for embalmer training purposes at the end of a thirty-
six hour period, provided said body is not claimed by family or friends for
private burial within said time period.  Said notice shall request that the
appropriate person at the institution submit a written request that the body be
turned over to said institution if not claimed for private burial or
cremation.  Said written request shall include a statement that said
institution will accept said body for purposes of medical or surgical study,
dissection or embalmer training as authorized by Ohio R.C. 1713.34.  Said
request shall also include an acknowledgment that the institution will pay the
expense of transporting the body to the place used for study or training; and
further, that said institution will dispose of the remains after the study or
training is complete, in the manner specified in Ohio R.C. 1713.36.  Request
forms submitted by institutions claiming the body for training purposes shall
be honored in the order the signed request is received by the Village if more
than one request is submitted.
   (c)   If the decedent died of an infectious disease, or the body is not
claimed by an institution or by a family member or friend for private burial or
cremation as outlined in subsection (b) hereof, then the Village will arrange
for cremation and necessary related services by a licensed funeral home chosen
by the Village, at the lowest and best price obtainable.  The Village
Administrator shall periodically contact the funeral home or homes that
maintain facilities in the Village, as well as funeral homes in the area but
located outside the Village corporation limits, to determine the lowest and
best price for said cremation services.  The Administrator shall negotiate a
fixed price for cremation and necessary related services with the chosen
funeral home, which fixed price shall remain in effect for a minimum period of
twelve months.  The Village shall contract with a local funeral home for said
services when possible, but the Administrator shall have discretion to contract
with funeral homes outside the Village if the Administrator is unable to
negotiate a reasonable fixed price for said services with a local funeral home.
   (d)   The Village, at its expense, shall provide a burial site in one of the
Village cemeteries, for the interment of the cremated remains and shall provide
for the opening and closing of said burial site.
   (e)   The Village shall, at its expense, provide a stone or concrete marker
to be placed at the burial or grave site of the indigent person’s remains.  The
marker shall include the deceased person’s name, age if known and the date of
death.  If an indigent family member or indigent friend of the deceased person
wishes to claim the ashes of the decedent, and the Administrator is satisfied
that said request is honorable and legitimate, the remains may be turned over
to said person in lieu of interring said remains in a Village cemetery and
providing a marker.
   (f)   The Village will assume responsibility only for the cost of cremation,
burial of the cremated remains and placement of a stone or concrete marker as
set forth above.  If family or friends of the decedent object to cremation and
request embalming and burial with casket and vault, they must enter into a
contract to pay the full cost of said services, said contract to be arranged
directly by them with a funeral home of their choice.  If family or friends are
unable to assume the cost of private burial or cremation, but wish to arrange
extra visitation hours or other extra services available through the funeral
home contracting with the Village to provide cremation and necessary minimum
related services, said persons may contract for said extra services at their
expense, directly with the funeral home performing the basic services at
Village expense.  The Village will not be responsible for any of said extra
expenses.  (Ord.  10-07.  Passed 6-1-10.)

   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases.  Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C).  If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.

   (d)   Upon written request of the taxpayer, the Village Tax Coordinator or
Designated Collecting Agent may extend the time for filing an annual return for

(Ord. 45-95.  Passed 12-19-95.)
181.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within the Village of North Baltimore who employs one or
more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis,

Coordinator.  Such employer, in collecting said tax, shall be deemed to hold
the same as trustee for the benefit of the Village of North Baltimore and any
such tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until same is
paid to the Village of North Baltimore, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of
such employer.  Provided, however, that no person shall be required to withhold
the tax on wages or other compensation paid to domestic servants employed
exclusively in or about such person’s residence; and provided also if a
resident of the Village of North Baltimore receives salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation which are subject to withholding of tax
imposed by a municipality other than North Baltimore, the employer may reduce
the tax to be withheld and paid to the Village of North Baltimore by the amount
of tax withheld and paid to the other municipality.  (Ord. 45-95.  Passed 12-

181.07  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every taxpayer who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject

year on or before April 30th of each ensuing year for the duration of the taxes
referred to herein.
(Ord. 10-95.  Passed 6-6-95.)
   (b)   Such declarations shall be filed upon a form prescribed by the Village
Tax Coordinator or the Designated Collecting Agent, which form may simply state
that the figures used in making such declaration are the figures used in making
the declaration of the estimate for the Federal Income Tax, provided that it is
understood that such figures may be modified according to the provisions of
this chapter so that the declaration required by this section shall set forth
only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   The declaration to be filed on April 30th of each year shall be
accompanied by payment of at least one-fourth (1/4) of the estimated annual
tax.  At least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the
sixth, ninth, and thirteenth month after the beginning of the taxable year. 
Provided, however, that such estimate may be amended at the time of the making
of any quarterly payment, and further provided that on or before April 30th of
the year following that for which declaration was filed, a final return shall
be filed and any balance which may be due the Village of North Baltimore shall
be paid therewith.  Should it appear that such taxpayer has paid more than the
amount of tax to which the Village is entitled, a refund of the amount so
overpaid shall be made, or same may be applied toward the declaration tax due
and obtainable from the Designated Collecting Agent.  (Ord. 45-95.  Passed 12-
19-95.)
   (d)   The failure of a taxpayer to pay the lesser of one of the two
following amounts, to wit: an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the total

disapproved such rule or regulation. (Ord. 45-95.  Passed 12-19-95.)
   (e)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show proper amount of tax due, the Designated
Collecting Agent may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the
Village from the taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement
showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalty, or
both, imposed by this chapter.

tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
182  are deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code 718 (ORC 718).  This Chapter is

182.012   PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE

   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-79,

   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division  (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)    Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in

      (H)   (i)    Except as limited by divisions (1)(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H)
of this section to offset qualifying wages.

than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i)  of this section.
            (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation

available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (1)(H) of this section.

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.

Section

withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.  Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax

respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer

or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03  of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051  of this Chapter.
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.053  COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.  (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)

182.061  DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03 (23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03 (1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
182.03( 11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
182.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19  of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
 182.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.  (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-
15.)
182.063  CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as
a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included
in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section

182.07   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)    Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
182.091  of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the

balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
182.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless
extended pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)     For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)     An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
182.10  of this Chapter  upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period

described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091  of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

182.081  NO CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   No credit shall be granted against the tax imposed by this Chapter for
municipal income tax paid by a resident of the Village for municipal income tax
paid by said resident to another municipality. (This Section
182.081 , was originally adopted by municipal Ordinance 2015-15 as amended
Section
 181.15  of the existing Chapter
181  of the Village Codified Ordinances, to become effective on January 1,
2016).  (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.083  CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
 182.081  of this Chapter.
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
 182.096  of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096,  the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
182.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)

return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal

by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
 182.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or  (c) of Section
182.051  of this Chapter.

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)     If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may  not  be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize

checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the

meaning as in Section

expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:

corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains

the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the

results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19  of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.096    REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:

               (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10  of this Chapter.

   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12–15-15.)
182.134   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10  of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of Section
 182.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the
Tax Administrator by law.
         (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.15    FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.  (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
             (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall  include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.17    ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.  (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. 
.         Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the OhioRevised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)     A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
 182.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.   
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18  of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
182.096  of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,

182.21  RENTAL INCOME.
   (A)   Rental income received by an taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
182.03 , only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived, whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part as defined in Section
182.21 (B).
   (B)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties, is a business activity
of such taxpayer and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax.  However, in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
Lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month.  It is further provided that the person who rents three or more
rooms to different persons in property shall be considered to be engaged in a
business activity, whether or not the gross rental income exceeds two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) per month; and provided further that in the case of
farm  property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity
when he shares in crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the
gross or net receipts derived from the farm, whether or not the gross rental
income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month. 
(Ord.  2015-79.  Passed 12-15-15.)
182.97  COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
 182.19.

this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
182.091  as though the same were continuing.

182.98   SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.

183.01  PURPOSE AND ALLOCATION.
   To supplement the general funds of our Village, there shall be levied an
excise tax on lodging furnished by a hotel or motel to a transient guest as
authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.08(A)
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   HOTEL or MOTEL.  Every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised, or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more
rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether the rooms are in
one or several structures.  Dormitory housing facilities located on property
owned by the state used for student housing shall not be classified as a hotel
or motel being held out to the public.
   (b)   OCCUPANCY.  The use or, possession of, or the right to the use or
possession of any room, rooms, space, or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes.  The use, possession, or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, for
banquets for private dining rooms, for exhibit space, sample or display space,
shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless
the person exercising occupancy, uses or possesses, or has the right to use or
possess, all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling,
lodging, or sleeping purposes.
   (c)   OPERATOR.  Any person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, or any other capacity.  Where the
operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or
character, other than an employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an
operator for the purposes of this chapter, and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his or her principal.  Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or managing agent shall, however, be considered
to be compliance by both.
   (d)   PERSON.  Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or
any other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (e)   RENT.  The consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)   TAX ADMINISTRATOR.  The Income Tax Administrator of the Village of
North Baltimore.
   (g)   TRANSIENT GUEST.   Persons occupying a room or rooms for sleeping
accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.  Should a person other
then an individual, enter into an agreement to rent a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for a period of longer then thirty consecutive days,
but said room or rooms are made available for occupancy by different individual
occupants during any consecutive thirty day period, said occupants remain 
transient guests for purposes of imposition of this tax.
      (Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village, through the use of the general fund of the Village, an excise tax
is levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or motel is or is to be
furnished to transient guests.
   (b)    The tax is three percent (3%) on all rents paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging.  The tax constitutes a debt owed by the
transient guest to the Village, which is extinguished only by payment to the
operator as trustee for the Village or to the Village.  The tax applies and is
collectable at the time the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when
the price is paid.
   (c)     For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels in the Village to transient guests is subject to the tax until the
contrary is established.
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.04  EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter upon rents not within the
taxing power of the Village under the constitution or federal or state laws
upon rents paid by the state or any of its political subdivisions.
   (b)    No exemption claimed under subsection (a) hereof shall be granted
except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected upon a form
prescribed by the tax administrator signed under penalty of perjury.  All
claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the tax
administrator.
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.05  PROHIBITED ACTS.
   (a)    No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as
required by this chapter or present to the operator false evidence indicating
that the lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
   (b)    No operator or other person shall:
      (1)    Fail, neglect or refuse to register as required by this chapter;
      (2)    Fail, neglect or refuse to furnish any return required to be made
by this chapter;
      (3)    Make any incomplete, false or fraudulent return; or
      (4)    Attempt to do anything whatsoever to avoid the payment of the
whole or any part of the tax, penalties, or interest imposed by this chapter.
         (Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)    The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the operator.  Each operator shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)    If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax.  If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies. 
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.07  DUTIES OF HOTEL OPERATOR.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be listed as tax on the room bill,
statement, or any other evidence of occupancy and shall be shown as a separate
item from the charge for occupancy rent.  The tax shall be paid by the
transient guest to the operator who will serve as a trustee for the Village and
the operator shall be liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.  (Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.08  REGISTRATION OF HOTELS.
   (a)     Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or
within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator
of any hotel renting lodging to transient guests shall register the hotel with
the tax administrator and obtain from the adminstrator a "Transient Occupancy
Registration Certificate" to be posted at all times in a conspicuous place on
the premises.
   (b)    This certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
      (1)   The name of the operator;
      (2)     The address of the hotel;
      (3)   The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
      (4)    "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that
the person  named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirement of the
Hotel-Motel Tax ordinance by registering with the tax administrator of the
Village of North  Baltimore for the purpose of collecting from transient guests
the Hotel-Motel Tax and remitting the tax to the tax administrator of the
Village of North Baltimore, Ohio.  This certificate does not constitute a
permit."
         (Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.09  HOTEL RECORDS.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and other pertinent
documents.  If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason.  Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to inspection by the tax administrator and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the tax administrator, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or shall be kept longer than
four years if an order is issued by the Village requesting that such records be
kept for a longer period of time.  (Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.10  RETURNS AND PAYMENTS.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of each month following the
close of each calendar quarter year, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the
tax administrator, on forms provided by the administrator, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected from transient occupants. 
All claims for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during
the reporting period shall be filed with the report.  At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax
administrator.  The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods
for any certificate holder if deemed by the administrator to be necessary in
order to ensure collection of the tax.  The administrator may require further
information in the return if such information is pertinent to the collection of
the tax.  Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason.  All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter
shall be held in trust for the account of the Village until payment thereof is
made to the tax administrator.  All returns and payments submitted by each
operator shall be treated as confidential by the tax administrator and shall
not be released by the administrator except upon order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States, the state, the
county, or the Village for official use only. 
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.11  DELINQUENCY AND FRAUD.
   (a)    Original Delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax
imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to
ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Continued Delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any
delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date
on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency
penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax and previous
penalty in addition to the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first
imposed.  An additional penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the total tax and
penalty of the previous thirty-day period shall be added for each successive
thirty-day period that the occupant remains delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud.  If the tax administrator determines that the non-payment of
any remittance due under this ordinance is due to fraud, a penalty equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (d)    Interest.  In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any
operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest
at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.
   (e)     Penalties During Pendency of Hearing of Appeal.  No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for herein, nor during the pendency of any appeal to the tax
administrator provided for herein.
   (f)     Responsibility of Filing.   The operator having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing a return and making
the payment shall be personally liable for failure or refusal to file the
return or pay the taxes, penalty and interest due as required.  The
dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of a corporation does not discharge
said operator's liability for a prior failure to file a return or pay the tax
due.
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.12  INTEREST AND PENALTIES; HEARING.
   (a)    If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make,
within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax
or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall
proceed in such manner deemed best, to obtain facts and information which to
base the administrator's estimate of the tax due.
   (b)     As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and
information as the administrator is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect the tax and to make such report and
remittance, the administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against the
operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter.  In
case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
his or her last known place of business.
   (c)     Such operator may, within ten days after the mailing of this notice,
or within ten days of service of the notice if hand delivered to the operator
or to a responsible adult at the operator's place of business or residence,
make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the
amount assessed.  If application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any,
determined by the administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable.  If such application is made, the tax
administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator, to show cause at a time and place fixed in
the notice, why the amount specified therein should not be fixed as to the tax,
interest, and penalties as determined by the administrator.  At the hearing,
the operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest, and
penalties should not be so fixed.
   (d)     After the hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper
tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in
the manner prescribed herein of such determination and amount of the tax,
interest, and penalties.  The amount determined to be due shall be payable
after fifteen days unless a further appeal is taken as provided herein.
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.13  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may appeal the
decision of the tax administrator by filing a notice of appeal with the
administrator within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the
determination of tax due.  The tax administrator shall fix a time and place for
hearing this appeal, and shall give notice in writing to the operator at his or
her last known place of business.  The appeal shall be heard by the a three
person panel which shall include the Mayor or a representative appointed by the
Mayor, the Village Legal Counsel and one citizen of the Village appointed by
the Mayor. A majority vote decision of the panel shall be final and conclusive
and shall be served upon the operator/appellant in the manner prescribed above
for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.14  LEGAL ACTION.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the
Village.  Any such tax collected by an operator or required by this chapter to
be collected by an operator, which has not been paid to the Village shall be
deemed a debt owed by the operator to the Village.  Any person owing money to
the Village under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action
brought in the name of the Village for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 10-12.  Passed 9-7-10.)
183.99  PENALTY.
   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by imprisonment for a period of not more
than six months, or both.

Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (4)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from
private property that is established as a private tow-away zone under this

303.083  as amended are now codified in Section
303.081 .)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

303.991  COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using a handheld electronic wireless communications device, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.204 except when utilizing any of the following:
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;
            2.   A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short
distances;
            3.   A “voice-operated or hands-free” device that allows the person
to use the electronic wireless communications device without the use of either
hand except to activate, deactivate, or initiate a feature or function;
            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43 .
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),
the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course,
the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such

required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability

attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be  marked by a

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

335.01  DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE  REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   No person shall receive a driver's license, or a motorcycle operator's

jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio.  No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.  The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

Codified Ordinances defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed
against the Municipality and liberally construed in favor of the accused.
   (b)   Rules of criminal procedure and sections of the Ohio Revised Code
providing for criminal procedure shall be construed so as to effect the fair,
impartial, speedy and sure administration of justice.
   (c)   Any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code or of a division of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also refer to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially equivalent offense

501.05  CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
   
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of a criminal offense and sentenced and confined
in the Wood County Jail facilities shall reimburse the Village for any and all
expenses and disbursements it has expended due to such confinement.
   (b)   Council may direct its Solicitor to initiate a civil action for the
recovery of the expenses and disbursements expended by the Village for the said
confinement in the Wood County Jail mentioned in subsection (a) hereof.  (Ord.
5-95.  Passed 3-28-95.)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.
If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary
hearing on restitution if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount
of restitution.  If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for

of the issuance of the written order. Failure  to correct the conditions on the
property  identified in the notice shall constitute a violation. A first

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06 , or
545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06  or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single

involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

913.03  BILLING AND PAYMENT OF WATER BILLS.
   (a)   WATER COST TO CONSUMERS.
Charges for water used will be based on the meter consumption at the rates
legally adopted by the legislative authority of the Village.  Rates are
established by Council and are published as the  Water Department Rate
Schedule.  A copy of the Water Department Rate Schedule is available from the
Village Clerk’s office.
   (b)   READING WATER METERS.
The frequency for reading of meters will be set by the Village Administrator or
his authorized representative based upon economic feasibility and other
considerations.  Meters will normally be read on or about the 15th day of each
month throughout the service area.  As a minimum, readings will be read bi-
monthly.  In cases where no meter reading is obtained, or in the case of an
inoperative meter, or three separate unsuccessful attempts to read a meter have
been made, the Village reserves the right to estimate and bill for the water
consumed on the basis of records preceding comparable periodic consumption. 
Industrial consumers will be read monthly at the discretion of the Village
Administrator or his authorized representative.
   (c)   BILLING OF METERED WATER.
Bills for metered water will be rendered on or about the first day of the month
following that in which the reading is taken.
   (d)   WHEN METERED WATER BILLS BECOME DELINQUENT.
Bills not paid by the 15th day of the billing month become delinquent and will
be subject to a penalty charge as prescribed in the current Water Department
Rate Schedule.  Thereafter, the water may be shut off in accordance with
subsections (h) and (i).
   (e)   CHARGES FOR WATER ARE A LIEN AGAINST PROPERTY.
All charges for water are assessed against the property to which the service is
rendered, and are a lien against such property, collectible in the same manner
as other taxes and assessments.  Administrative costs for said lien are to be
borne by the property owner.  It shall be the duty of persons purchasing
property to ascertain if there are any unpaid water bills standing against the
property.  Until such charges are paid, water service may be refused.
   (f)   OWNER MAY HAVE TENANT PAY WATER BILL.
If the owner of any premises elects to have his tenant or lessee pay the water
charges as they accrue, such tenant or lessee does so as the agent of the owner
and such owner shall not thereby be relieved from the payment of any
delinquencies that might occur.  A deposit as identified in the Water
Department Rate Schedule shall be made by tenant before service is rendered. 
Said deposit will be held by the Village until water service for the tenant is
terminated or  for a period of not less than twenty-four (24) months of
delinquent free billing, at which time the deposit will be refunded to the
tenant upon approval of the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative.  When the water bill is in the tenant’s name and the bill is
current, the Water Department is prohibited from shutting off the water service
to help an owner evict a tenant or help the owner collect rent.
   (g)    BILLS TO BE DELIVERED TO CONSUMER.
      (1)   The Village will undertake to deliver bills for water by depositing
same with the United States Postal Service only as a matter of convenience to
the owner or consumer.  Failure to receive bills shall not relieve any person
of their obligation to pay such bills. Any change of billing must be ordered by
the property owner or agent for the owner. A fee as established in the Water
Department Rate Schedule will be assessed any time a service address is changed
into a new name requiring an existing meter to be read.  (Ord. 97-20.  Passed
6-3-97.)
      (2)   In addition to the Village undertaking the delivery of bills for
water accounts by the United States Postal Service, the Village shall also
provide water consumers with the ability to establish and manage their accounts
online and the option to bill pay through the online account.
         (Ord.  2019-15.  Passed 8-6-19.)
   (h)   DELINQUENT ACCOUNT DEFINED; WATER MAY BE REFUSED
      DELINQUENT ACCOUNT.
An account is delinquent if payment is not received at the billing clerk’s
office by the 16th day of the month the bill was mailed.  Accounts delinquent
more than 10 days will result in a water shut- off.  Water will not be turned
on until arrangements are made with the Water Department Clerk to pay all
delinquencies.  Under no circumstances will partial payment of a delinquent
bill equaling less than 50% of the outstanding balance be accepted in restoring
service.  Any account balance overdue in excess of 150% of the average
preceding three months must be paid in full to restore or maintain service.  An
“on-off” charge as prescribed in the current Water Department Rate Schedule
will be charged to restore service to any delinquent account.  Any account
being delinquent more than three billing periods in any twelve month cycle will
result in immediate shut- off for any subsequent delinquencies.  (Ord. 07-21. 
Passed 8-7-07.)
   (i)   NOTICE REQUIRED BEFORE SHUTOFF.
      (1)   A delinquency notice shall be mailed by regular mail to the person
who is named on the Water Department billing records to receive the bill.  If
the bill is mailed to an address other than the address of the property served,
a copy shall also be mailed by regular mail to the property address addressed
to “Occupants”.
      (2)   A property owner who does not regularly receive the monthly water
bill, or who is responsible for paying the bill, will receive a copy of the
delinquency notice providing said property owner furnishes the Village
Administrator or his authorized representative with a current address.  No
attempt will be made to effect delivery of returned mailings.
      (3)   Service may be discontinued ten (10) days after the delinquency
notice is mailed as required in subsection (i)(1).
      (4)   The delinquency notice shall include the following statement:
 
DELINQUENT NOTICE
Our records indicate that your service account is in arrears in the amount shown
on this notice.  If you do not make arrangements to pay the delinquent amount by
contacting the Village Clerk’s Office within ten (10) days of the date this
notice was mailed, your water service will be shut off.  In addition to the
delinquency penalty being herein assessed you will incur a non-refundable “on-
off” chargeas prescribed in the current Water Department Rate Schedule if it is
necessary to shut- off your water service.
(Ord. 97-20 . Passed 6-3-97.)
   (j)   NO ALLOWANCE FOR LEAKAGE.
If a continuous leak is detected by our system, the consumer will be notified
within three (3) business days by the Village.  If the consumer finds a leak,
they must immediately notify the Village.  The consumer will be responsible for
all water used or lost as a result of leaks after the water passes through the
meter installed at a single family dwelling.  If the system that detects and
records continuous water leaks should fail at any time for any reason, the
Village shall not provide an allowance for leakage.  Once the system is
restored and performing to capacity, the Village shall have three (3) working
days from the date the system is operationally restored to inform the resident
of a single family dwelling of a leak.
However, if the Village fails to notify the resident(s) at a single family
dwelling within three (3) business days, the resident(s) will only be
responsible for the first three (3) days of the water loss due to a leak.  The
Village shall adjust any billing related to water loss or usage as a result of
a leak after the third (3rd) business day has passed.  Such billing adjustments
do not apply to multi-residential properties or industrial/commercial
properties.  Also excluded from billing adjustments  are leaks resulting from
water that is being used to keep pipes from freezing during the winter months.
Water/Sewer billing may be adjusted as prescribed in Water/Sewer Department
Regulations.  All water/sewer billing adjustments shall be subject to approval
of the Village Administrator or his authorized representative and the Water and
Waste Water Director who shall review the evidence of water lost resulting from
the leak.  In the event of a disagreement between the Village Administrator and
the Water and Waste Water Director, the matter shall be determined by the
legislative body at its next regular meeting.  (Ord.  2019-28.  Passed 10-15-
19.)
   (k)   UNREPAIRED LEAKS.
Where a consumer has been notified of leaks and repair is not made within seven
(7) days, service may be shut off without further notice.  Where a consumer has
been notified of leaks during times of “Emergency Water Restrictions” and
repairs are not made with three (3) working days, service may be shut off
without further notice.
   (l)   VACATION POLICY.
Consumers leaving on extended vacations may have their water shut off and
restarted at a cost reflected in the Water Department Rate Schedule. Water
consumption/usage charges shall be temporarily suspended if service is shut
off.  No other special or reduced rates shall apply to “vacation status”
customers.  (Ord. 97-20.  Passed 6-3-97.)
   (m)   FILLING SWIMMING POOLS.
Swimming pools will not be filled through a fire hydrant.  Swimming pools may
be filled through consumer's own service line using a garden hose.  In certain
cases sewer charges may be waived for the initial seasonal filling of a
swimming pool, provided the limitations and procedures approved by Council on
September 2, 2014, concerning the size of the pool, required notice to the
Village and the metering of fill water are followed.  Council reserves the
right to amend or modify the limitations and procedures from time to time as
deemed necessary.
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 5-2-15.)
   (n)   ADJUSTMENT FOR WINTER USAGE.
No adjustment shall be made in any water bill as a result of a consumer
electing to allow water to drip during freezing weather to prevent the freezing
of service.  Special exception may be granted on an individual basis by the
Village Administrator or his authorized representative if recommended by the
Water Superintendent.
   (o)   BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
Any billing adjustments resulting from mis-reads or clerical errors as may
arise shall be presented to the Water Department Superintendent and Village
Administrator or his authorized representative for approval.
   (p)   PRO-RATED BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
New service and final billings will be made by the Water Department Clerk on a
pro-rated basis as prescribed in the Water Department Rate Schedule.  Pro-rated
billing adjustments do not require approval of the Village Administrator or his
authorized representative.

a fire.
   (e)   NOTICE REQUIRED ON BROKEN SEAL.
When a seal has been broken, immediate notice must be given to the North
Baltimore Water Department.
   (f)   BROKEN SEAL PENALTY.
When upon inspection, any seal has been found broken from any cause whatsoever
other than fire protection, the regulations identified under Section
913.02(m) shall apply.
   (g)   WATER CONSUMED FOR FIRES.
In lieu of charges for water used in the case of fire, the Village will require
the payment as defined in the Water Department Rate Schedule.  In addition, all
applicable charges at current water rates will be billed for any water
registered by the detector type meter.
   (h)   USE OF HYDRANTS BY FIRE DEPARTMENT.
Fire hydrants are intended primarily for the use of the Fire Department. 
Interference with such use in any way is prohibited.  Permits for use of
hydrants for other purposes are given by the Village Administrator or his
authorized representative reluctantly and only in cases where such use cannot
be avoided.  Penalties for unauthorized use are provided by Ordinance, as well
as by these rules and regulations.
   (i)   PENALTY FOR OPERATING FIRE HYDRANTS UNLAWFULLY.

Department or Sewer Department shall open, operate or remove the nozzle cap
from any public or private fire hydrant to which water is supplied in whole or
in part by the Water Department, or draw water therefrom except for the purpose
of extinguishing fires without first having secured the necessary permits. 
(Ord. 97-20.  Passed 6-3-97.)
913.05  WATER LINE EXTENSIONS.
   (a)   WATER LINE EXTENSIONS IN THE VILLAGE.
      (1)   Assessed  Projects.  Property owners desiring the laying of new
water lines or extensions in the Village of North Baltimore as an assessment
project as provided for in Ohio R.C. Chapters 727 and 729 must present a
petition requesting such lines or extensions to the Village Administrator or
his authorized representative. If the project is authorized by Village Council
the cost of such lines shall be borne by the property owners so petitioning, at
the rate per lineal foot as legally prescribed by the Village. The size and
kind of line to install shall be decided by, and the work of installing shall
be done under the supervision of the Water Superintendent. When a water line
has been installed along a street in the manner hereinabove set forth, any
property owner or occupant on said street shall pay to the Village the same
rate based upon the front footage of his or her property along said line.
      (2)   Projects Built By Developers.  In cases where a developer or
property owner wishes to bring water to a previously undeveloped area, a
request in writing must be submitted to the Village Administrator or his
authorized representative outlining the proposed new development. The cost of
extending water service mains to the new development will be borne by the
property owner/developer. Lines must be installed pursuant to specifications
approved by the Village Water Superintendent, and/or the Village Engineer. Once
the line is inspected, tested and approved and the connections to the Village
water supply system are made, the line shall become part of the Village water
supply system and shall be under the complete ownership and control of the
Village.
   (b)   WATER LINE EXTENSIONS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE LIMITS.
Petitioners for water line extensions outside the North Baltimore Village
limits will be reviewed by the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative.  The Village Administrator or his authorized representative
will determine the feasibility of the petition and forward recommendations to
the Village Council for action.  Costs for the entire construction project
shall be borne by the petitioners.  All such construction plans, specifications
and installation shall be subject to approval of the Village Administrator or
his authorized representative.  Supervision of the project shall be under the
guidance of the Water Department Superintendent.
   (c)   COSTS FOR PROJECT SUPERVISION.
Any project requiring the supervision of the Water Department Superintendent or
another designated individual shall be as identified in the current Water
Department Rate Schedule.
   (d)   WATER LINE ROTARY FEE POLICY.
   The Village will enter into a contract with a property owner, or developer,
who files a written request with the Village Administrator to install water
service lines to serve an undeveloped area of the Village. The agreement will
authorize the collection of a fee in addition to the normal tap fee, said fee
to be known as a "Rotary Fee", with the agreement to be known as a "Rotary Fee
Contract". The Contract will conform to the following:
      (1)   Only owners and developers who privately construct extensions of
Village water service lines will be eligible to enter into a Rotary Fee
Contract. To qualify, the original developer or owner must design, locate, size
and construct new line(s) conforming to specifications approved by the Village
Water Superintendent, in consultation with the Village Administrator and/or the
Village Engineer. Only new line(s) designed, sized and constructed with
sufficient extra capacity to service property in addition to the property the
original developer or builder plans to serve at the time the new line(s) are
constructed will be eligible for Rotary Fee Contracts. The Village shall
determine whether the proposed new water line project qualifies for a Rotary
Fee contract. If the cost of the project is supplemented by the Village or
Northwest Regional Water and Sewer District, and/or any other entity serving
the public interest, the developer or individual will be reimbursed only their
proportionate share. Before the line(s) are accepted by the Village and/or
rotary fees are collected, the new line(s) must pass Village inspection and
testing. The new line(s) will become the property of the Village's water system
and fall under the Village's exclusive control as of the date said line(s) are
placed in service.
         (Ord. 06-56.  Passed 1-17-07.)
      (2)   Rotary fees will be assessed and collected for an initial maximum
period of ten years from the date the line(s) are placed in service.  Village
Council reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to extend the period of
time that rotary fees will be assessed and collected pursuant to a rotary fee
agreement with a developer for a period of up to an additional ten years from
the date of the assessment and collection period in the original agreement
expires.  The Village Administrator together with Village legal counsel shall
have the authority to specify in the original rotary fee agreement with the
developer the requirements for submitting a request for an extension of the
collection period.  (Ord. 07-12.  Passed 5-1-07.)
      (3)   Developers and owners who wish to enter into a rotary fee contract
must request that the Village consider entering into such a contract with said
developer up to twelve months before the subject project is to begin, but no
later than ninety days after the date the new line(s) constructed by the
developer are placed in service. Requests must be in writing and filed in the
Village Clerk's office. The developer or owner who extended the water line must
file with the Village Administrator a notarized statement documenting the
actual footage, the estimated cost of the water line extension if prior to 
commencement of construction, and the final cost of the water line extension
within the ninety day period after the line(s) are placed in service.
Actual final cost of a water line extension shall include all items of
material, labor and other directly associated costs including associated
designated engineering, and including costs for the opening of existing
pavement, and street resurfacing necessary to complete the installation.
Excluded shall be general office expense pertaining to the purchase, storage,
delivery and installation of all materials necessary for the extensions. Those
costs are considered to be the responsibility of the developer in conducting
normal business. Costs will be reviewed the Water Superintendent and/or Village
Engineer for reasonableness and a confirmation letter of the approved costs
will be sent to the developer by the Village Administrator's office.
(4)   The developer must additionally pay an administrative fee equal to five
percent (5%) of the actual final cost limited to a maximum fee of $1,000. The
administrative fee is to cover the Village's cost of  maintaining records on
new connections, receiving and remitting connection charges, etc. The full
administrative fee is to be paid at the time the first Rotary Fee is  collected
and paid to the developer.
      (5)   Failure to file the notarized statement of actual final cost within
ninety days of the date the line is placed in service will result in the
developer or individual being ineligible for reimbursement.
      (6)   The Rotary Fee to be collected from a party requesting a permit to
tap a line subject to a Rotary Fee contract shall be determined based on one of
the following methods,
         A.   Front Foot Method. If a line is to be tapped to serve a single
family residence, or a single commercial or industrial project, the rotary fee
to be collected will normally be based on the frontage of the parcel being
served by the proposed tap that is adjacent to the line being tapped, and shall
be calculated by multiplying the served parcel's front footage by fifty percent
(50%) of the developer's per foot cost for said line to be tapped, unless it is
determined that paragraph (6)B. should apply.
Example: Actual per lineal foot cost rounded to the nearest whole dollar value,
multiplied by 50% = "the per foot fee" subject to collection by the Village as
a Rotary Fee. Amount collected from each end user is based on the front footage
of the lot being serviced multiplied by "the per foot fee".
            Actual cost of a Main extension = $16.00 per lineal foot.
            $16.00 X 50% = $8.00
            $8.00 X 220 (Front footage of property tapping the Main) =
            $ 1,760.00
            $1,760.00 (Amount to be reimbursed to the developer)
         B.   Benefit Conferred Method. An alternate method of determining the
rotary fees to be assessed is necessary to accommodate large mains that have a
high cost per foot, where the tap is intended to serve a small project that
will utilize a very small part of the main's capacity, and which might make the
new project economically unfeasible if the party tapping is required to pay a
fee based on the method specified in paragraph (6)A., above. If the calculated 
rotary
   fee for a requested tap intended to serve a single family residence or a
single commercial or industrial project exceeds $6,000, and the party
requesting the tap requests that the rotary fee be determined based on the
benefit conferred method, a decision to apply method (6)A., or (6)B. shall be
determined by the Village Water Superintendent, together with the Mayor and the
Village Administrator, who shall make their decision by majority vote. If they
determine to charge a rotary fee based on method (6)B., they shall determine by
majority vote, the amount of the rotary fee to be charged in each case, which
shall not be less than twenty percent (20%) of, or exceed the amount that would
apply if the method specified in (6)A. was applied.
C.   Appeal. If the party seeking permission to tap a line, or the developer
who constructed the line, objects to the determination made by the Mayor,
Superintendent and the Administrator, that party shall have ten days from the
date written notice of the decision is served on them to file written
objections with the Village Clerk. If an objection is filed, the Clerk shall
convene three adult residents of the Village who shall meet as binding
arbitrators to resolve the objection to the decision of the Mayor,
Administrator and Water Superintendent. The arbitrators shall review and make a
binding determination of the method to be used  to calculate the rotary fee
and, if the method selected is based on "benefit conferred", shall determine
the amount of the rotary fee. Persons serving as arbitrators shall not be
employed by the Village,  or hold elected office in the Village, or serve in
any paid capacity in Village government, nor shall any of said persons be
employed by or related to the developer, or the party seeking to tap a line. 
The arbitrators shall meet within fourteen days to decide the issue. The
Village Clerk shall notify all interested parties of the date of the meeting.
The original developer or his heirs or assigns as well as the party required to
pay the rotary fee when finally determined, may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present their position on the issue; or they may elect to present
their position to the arbitrators in writing. In order not to delay projects
any person required to pay a rotary fee to secure permission to tap a Village
water line may deposit the highest possible rotary fee that may be assessed
with the Village Finance Officer or Clerk to be held without interest, until
the decision on the amount of the rotary fee to be assessed is final. Any
excess deposit will be refunded.
      (7)   If a water main extension is further extended by another developer,
no  rotary fee will be collected and no reimbursement is applicable. The 
Village requires Municipal ownership of all approved distribution and 
collection mains and does not impose costs for extensions of mains.  To be
exempt from payment of a rotary fee, “extensions” of a water  main requested by
another developer shall mean only those  connections made to a water main
covered by a rotary fee agreement,  that are sized and constructed as required
by the Village, with the intention of serving additional undeveloped territory
not under the control of the developer or property owner requesting the right
to extend. The requested “extension” water main must be eligible for its own
rotary fee agreement. All other connections shall be considered “taps” as that
term is used in Section
913.05(d)(6) and will be required to pay the applicable rotary fee.
      (8)   In no case will the developer or owner responsible for the water
main  extension subject to a rotary fee contract be eligible to recover more 
than fifty percent (50%) of the actual final cost of the extension.
      (9)   No Rotary Fee is applicable for "Surface/Storm Water" collection
systems. As no tap fee is currently assessed for surface water connections, any
storm water drainage collection system installed by a developer is understood
to become Village property immediately upon acceptance by the Village
Administrator's office.  (Ord. 06-56.  Passed 1-17-07.)
      (10)   Collection of rotary fees, unless the collection period is
extended at Village Council’s discretion as provided in subsection (d)(2),
shall terminate ten years from the date the original line subject to a rotary
fee contract is placed in service, or when the original developer has received
reimbursement orf fifty percent (50%) of his costs from prior rotary fees
collected, whichever occurs first.  The date a party first requests permission
to tap a line subject to a rotary fee contract shall be documented in writing
on a request form submitted to the Village Administrator or the Water
Superintendent.  The request form shall be required before discussions
concerning tapping any Village line are undertaken.  Even if the exact course
or point of tapping or connection is not determined until a later time, and/or
the actual tap or connection is not made until a later time, the date used to
determine whether a rotary fee is to be assessed as falling within the ten year
limitation shall be the date the request form is submitted.
         (Ord. 07-12.  Passed 5-1-07.)
      (11)   The original developer or his/her/its heirs or assigns shall be
paid one- hundred percent (100%) of each rotary fee collected by the Village
under authority of subsection (d)(6) hereof, during the effective period of
that developer's rotary fee contract. Payment shall be made to original
developer within thirty days of the date the actual tap is made. 
      (12)   Rotary fees will not apply to property owned by, or under the
control of the developer or any entity owned or controlled by developer that
the line or main was originally intended to serve. The Village shall not be
required to collect or pay rotary fees for taps to a line that serves a public
use or public facility, or for taps made by the Village to replace a water line
serving a customer who was receiving service from the Village prior to the date
of this agreement. The Village shall have the authority to authorize taps to a
line subject to a Rotary Fee Agreement which replaces a line serving an
existing customers without requiring payment of a rotary fee, provided the
replacement tap is no larger then the service tap being replaced.
      (13)   Other associated fees as may be applicable, including "Impact
Fees", if any, will be in addition to rotary fees, and no developer may waive
the imposition or collection of those fees. A developer may elect to waive the
collection of rotary fees to which they are entitled upon written notification
to the Village Clerk's office. Each property to which a fee is to be waived
will require separate notification for file purposes.
         (Ord. 06-56.  Passed 1-17-07.)

so served shall furnish to the Superintendent of Water any information which he
may request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such
property.  The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the
discretion of the Superintendent of Water, be deemed evidence of the presence
of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (d)   The Village Water Superintendent is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains.  Water service to such property shall not be

are to be enlarged, or additional service lines are to be extended, are
contiguous to any land within the corporation limits of the Village, the Owner
of said contiguous land must petition for annexation to the Village and
continue to exert all efforts to obtain annexation until such annexation is
complete before the property shall be eligible to receive water service. 
Village water services shall not be extended until the annexation has been
granted or until the annexation has been denied by the County Commissioners.
   (b)   If the Owner’s petition for annexation is denied by the County
Commissioners, the Owner, prior to receiving water services, enlarged lines, or
additional service lines shall enter into a written agreement with the Village
providing that the Owner will continue to exert all effort to  obtain
annexation of said contiguous property; agreeing further that should the Owner
sell such property or any part thereof to be served by water service prior to
annexation, that the Owner will require a similar agreement from any purchaser
of land.  The Owner further agrees to place a covenant in any deed conveying
any part of said property originally contiguous to the Village of North
Baltimore to which water services are extended, requiring that any purchaser
consent to and exert all efforts to complete annexation of said property. 
(Ord. 02-46.  Passed 7-2-02.)
913.10  EXTENSION OF WATER SERVICES TO LAND NOT CONTIGUOUS  TO THE VILLAGE.
   If the lands to which water services are to be extended, service lines are
to be enlarged, or additional services are to be extended, are not contiguous
to the present Village corporations limits, before receiving said water
service, enlargement of service lines, or additional service lines, the Owner
shall enter into an agreement with the Village to exert all efforts to obtain
annexation of the property to be served by said services, including the signing
of a petition for annexation when it is legally possible to do so.  The Owner
must also agree to require a similar agreement from any person or entity that
purchases any part of the property to be served by said services, further
agreeing to include in any deed conveying any interest in said real estate to
be served by said services, a covenant requiring the purchaser to consent to
and exert all efforts to complete annexation of said property when and if said
property becomes contiguous to the Village corporation limits or otherwise
becomes eligible for annexation.
(Ord. 02-46.  Passed 7-2-02.)
913.11  INTENT TO SHARE TAX REVENUES ON ANNEXATION.
   Not withstanding Ohio R.C. 709.19 specifying a transition period for the
sharing of taxes with a township on certain larger territorial annexations,
Council desires to go on record as expressing its intention to negotiate an
agreement on the sharing of property taxes on property annexed from any
adjacent township to the Village of North Baltimore, provided such an agreement
would not be contrary to law.  If the territory to be annexed is already
included in a CEDA or JEDD agreement already in place with the Township, that
agreement shall control.  The intent of this section is not to fix a specific
percentage amount or specific duration for the sharing of taxes, but to state
an intention on the part of the Village to negotiate in good faith with the
township on the sharing of property tax revenues to ease the effect on the
township’s budget caused by property annexed to the Village pursuant to
Codified Ordinance Sections
913.09 ,
913.10  and
913.11 .  (Ord. 07-21.  Passed 8-7-07.)
913.12  RATES.
   EDITOR’S NOTE:  Rates for water services shall be set forth in separate

incompatible with the system.
   (c)   To set forth the policy, rules and regulations controlling the
extension of Village services to properties outside the Village corporation
limits.
   (d)   To eliminate the introduction of storm and ground water into the

order entered with respect thereto. 
   (c)   Notification of Violation-Administrative Adjustment.  Whenever the
Village Administrator or his authorized representative finds that any
Discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies termination of a wastewater
treatment services, pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, the Village
Administrator or his authorized representative shall serve or cause to be
served upon such Discharger, a written notice either personally or by certified
or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged
violation. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the Discharger
shall respond personally or in writing to the Village Administrator or his
authorized representative advising of its position with respect to the
allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of
the allegations and where necessary, the Village Administrator or his
authorized representative shall define a plan for the satisfactory correction
thereof.
   (d)   Show Cause Hearing.   Where the violation of subsection (b) hereof is
not corrected by timely compliance by means of Administration Adjustment, the
Village Administrator or his authorized representative may order any Discharger
which causes or allows conduct prohibited by subsection (b)  hereof to show
cause before the Village Administrator or his authorized representative, why
the proposed service termination action should not be taken.  A written notice
shall be served on the Discharger by personal service, specifying the time and
place of a hearing to be held by the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action
is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the Discharger
to show cause before the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative, why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  The
notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before the
hearing.  Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized
representative of a Discharger.  The proceedings at the hearing shall be
considered by the Village Administrator or his authorized representative, which
shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper
activities of the Discharger.

Administrator or his authorized representative with respect to the conduct of a
Discharger contrary to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, the Attorney
for the Village Administrator or his authorized representative may, following
the authorization of such action by the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief
in the appropriate local area court.
   (f)   Operating Upsets.  Any Discharger which experiences an upset in
operations which places the Discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance
with this Regulation, shall inform the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative thereof immediately upon first awareness of the commencement of
the upset.  Where such information is given orally, a written follow-up report
thereof shall be filed by the Discharger with the Village Administrator or his
authorized representative within five days.  The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on a Discharger's compliance status.
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
   A documented and verified bonafide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the Village Administrator or his
authorized representative against a Discharger for any noncompliance with the
Regulation which arises out of violation alleged to have occurred during the
period of the upset.

(Ord. 11-06.  Passed 5-3-11.)
915.31  SANITARY SEWER LINE EXTENSIONS AND ROTARY FEE POLICY.
   (a)   Sanitary Sewer Line Extensions in the Village. 
      (1)   Assessed projects.  Property owners desiring the laying of new
sanitary sewer lines or extensions in the Village of North Baltimore as an
assessment project as provided for in Ohio R.C. Chapters 727 and 729 may
present a petition requesting such lines or extensions to the Village
Administrator or his authorized representative. If the project is authorized by
Village Council the cost of such lines shall be borne by the property owners so
petitioning, at the rate per lineal foot as legally prescribed by the Village.
The size and kind of line to install shall be decided by, and the work of
installing shall be done under the supervision of the Sewer Superintendent.
When a sanitary sewer line has been installed along a street in the manner
hereinabove set forth, any property owner or occupant on said street who
desires to secure sanitary sewer service from the line, or who is required by
law to connect to said line, shall pay to the Village the rate based upon the
front footage of his or her property along said line as assessed other property
owners served by said line if the project is constructed by or at the direction
of the Village as an assessment project.
      (2)   Projects built by developers.  In cases where a developer or
property owner wishes to bring sanitary sewer to a previously undeveloped area,
a request in writing must be submitted to the Village Administrator or his
authorized  representative outlining the proposed new development. The cost of 
extending sanitary sewer service mains to the new development will be borne  by
the property owner/developer. Lines must be installed pursuant to
specifications approved by the Village Sewer Superintendent, and/or the 
Village Engineer. Once the line is inspected, tested and approved and the 
connections to the Village sanitary sewer system are made, the line shall
become part of the Village sanitary sewer system and shall be under the 
complete ownership and control of the Village.
   (b)   Sanitary Sewer Line Rotary Fee Policy.  The Village will enter into a
contract with a property owner, or developer who files a written request with
the Village Administrator to install sanitary sewer service mains to serve an
undeveloped area of the Village. The agreement will authorize the collection of
a fee in addition to the normal tap fee, said fee to be known as a "Rotary
Fee", with the agreement to be known as a "Rotary Fee Contract". The Contract
will conform to the following:
      (1)   Only owners and developers who privately construct extensions of
Village sanitary sewer service lines will be eligible to enter into a Rotary
Fee Contract. To qualify, the original developer or owner must design, locate,
size and construct new line(s) conforming to specifications approved by the
Village Sewer Superintendent, in consultation with the Village Administrator
and/or the Village Engineer.  Only new line(s) designed, sized and constructed
with sufficient extra capacity to service property in addition to the property
the original developer or builder plans to serve at the time the new line(s)
are constructed will be eligible for Rotary Fee Contracts. The Village shall
determine whether the proposed new sanitary sewer line project qualifies for a
Rotary Fee contract. If the cost of the project is supplemented by the Village
or Northwest Regional Water and Sewer District, and/or any other entity serving
the public interest, the developer or individual will be reimbursed only their
proportionate share.
Before the line(s) are accepted by the Village and/or rotary fees are
collected, the new line(s) must pass Village inspection and testing. The new
line(s) will become the property of the Village's sanitary sewer system and
fall under the Village's exclusive control as of the date said line(s) are
placed in service.
      (2)   Rotary fees will be assessed and collected for an initial maximum
period of ten years from the date the line(s) are placed in service.  Village
Council reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to extend the period of
time that rotary fees will be assessed and collected pursuant to a rotary fee
agreement with a developer for a period of up to an additional ten years from
the date the assessment and collection period in the original agreement
expires.  The Village Administrator together with Village legal counsel shall
have the authority to specify in the original rotary fee agreement with the
developer, the requirements for submitting a request for an extension of the
collection period. 
      (3)   Developers and owners who wish to enter into a rotary fee contract
must request that the Village consider entering into such a contract with said
developer up to twelve months before the subject project is to begin, but no
later than ninety days after the date the new line(s) constructed by the
developer are placed in service. Requests must be in writing and filed in the
Village Clerk's office. The developer or owner who extended the sanitary sewer
line must file with the Village Administrator a notarized statement documenting
the actual footage,  the estimated cost of the sanitary sewer line extension if
prior to commencement of construction, and the final cost of the sanitary sewer
line extension within the ninety day period after the line(s) are placed in
service. Actual final cost of a sanitary sewer line extension shall include all
items of material, labor and other directly associated costs including
associated designated engineering, and including costs for the opening of
existing pavement, and street resurfacing necessary to complete the
installation. Excluded shall be general office expense pertaining to the
purchase, storage, delivery and installation of all materials necessary for the
extensions. Those costs are considered to be the responsibility of the
developer in conducting normal business. Costs will be reviewed by the Sewer
Superintendent and/or Village Engineer for reasonableness and a confirmation
letter approving costs will be sent to the developer by the Village
Administrator's office.
      (4)   The developer must additionally pay an administrative fee equal to
five percent (5%) of the actual final cost limited to a maximum fee of one
thousand dollars ($1,000). The administrative fee is to cover the Village's
cost of maintaining records on new connections, receiving and remitting 
connection charges, etc. The full administrative fee is to be paid at the time
the first Rotary Fee is collected and paid to the developer.
      (5)   Failure to file the notarized statement of actual final cost within
ninety days of the date the line is placed in service will result in the
developer or individual being ineligible for reimbursement.
      (6)   The Rotary Fee to be collected from a party requesting a permit to
tap a line subject to a Rotary Fee contract shall be determined based on one of
the following methods:
         A.   Front Foot Method. If a line is to be tapped to serve a single
family residence, or a single commercial or industrial project, the rotary fee
to be collected will normally be based on the frontage of the parcel being
served by the proposed tap that is adjacent to the line being tapped, and shall
be calculated by multiplying the served parcel's front footage by fifty percent
(50%) of the developer's per foot cost for said line to be tapped, unless it is
determined that paragraph (6)B. should apply.
Example: Actual per lineal foot cost rounded to the nearest whole dollar value,
multiplied by 50% = "the per foot fee" subject to collection by the Village as
a Rotary Fee. Amount collected from each end user is based on the front footage
of the lot being serviced multiplied by "the per foot fee".
            Actual cost of a Main extension = $16.00 per lineal foot.
            $16.00 X 50% = $8.00.
            $8.00 X 220 (Front footage of property tapping the Main) =
            $1,760.00
            $1,760.00 (Amount to be reimbursed to the developer)
         B.   Benefit Conferred Method. Alternate methods of determining the 
rotary fees to be assessed are necessary to accommodate large mains that have a
high cost per foot, where the tap is intended to serve a small project that
will utilize a very small part of the main's capacity, and which might make the
new project economically unfeasible if the party tapping is required to pay a
fee based on the method specified in (6)A., above. If the calculated rotary fee
for a requested tap intended to serve a single family residence or a single
commercial or industrial project exceeds eight thousand dollars ($8,000), and
the party  requesting the tap requests that the rotary fee be determined based
on the benefit conferred method, a decision to apply method (6)A., or (6)B.
shall be determined by the Village Sewer Superintendent, together with the
Mayor and the Village Administrator, who shall make their decision by majority
vote. If they determine to charge a rotary fee based on method (6)B., they
shall determine by majority vote, the amount of the rotary fee to be charged in
each case, which shall not be less than twenty percent (20%) of, or exceed the
amount that would apply if the method specified in (6)A. was applied.
C.   Appeal. If the party seeking permission to tap a line, or the developer
who constructed the line objects to the determination made by the Mayor,
Superintendent and the Administrator, that party shall have ten days from the
date written notice of the decision is served on them to file written
objections with the Village Clerk. If an objection is filed, the Clerk shall
convene three adult residents of the Village who shall meet as binding
arbitrators to resolve the objection to the decision of the Mayor, 
Administrator and Sewer Superintendent. The arbitrators shall review and make a
binding determination of the method to be used  to calculate the rotary fee
and, if the method selected is based on "benefit conferred", shall determine
the amount of the rotary fee.  Persons serving as arbitrators shall not be
employed by the Village, or hold elected office in the Village, or serve in any
paid capacity in Village government, nor shall any of said persons be employed
by or related to the developer, or the party seeking to tap a line.  The
arbitrators shall meet within fourteen days to decide the issue. The  Village
Clerk shall notify all interested parties of the date of the meeting. The
original developer or his heirs or assigns as well as the party required to pay
the rotary fee when finally determined, may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present their position on the issue; or they may elect to present
their position to the arbitrators in writing. In order not to delay projects
any person required to pay a rotary fee to secure permission to tap a Village
sanitary sewer line may deposit the highest possible rotary fee that may be
assessed with the Village Finance Officer or Clerk to be held without interest,
until the decision on the amount of the rotary fee to be assessed is final. Any
excess deposit will be refunded.
      (7)   If a sanitary sewer main extension is further extended by another 
developer, no rotary fee will be collected and no reimbursement is  applicable.
The Village requires Municipal ownership of all approved  distribution and
collection mains and does not impose costs for  extensions of mains. To be
exempt from payment of a rotary fee, "extensions" of a sewer main requested by
another developer shall mean only those connections made to a sewer main
covered by a rotary fee agreement, that are sized and constructed as required
by the Village, with the intention of serving additional undeveloped territory
not under the control of the developer or property owner requesting the right
to extend. The requested "extension" sewer main must be eligible for its own
rotary fee agreement. All other connections shall be considered "taps" as that
term is used in Section
915.11(b)(6) and will be required to pay the applicable rotary fee.
      (8)   In no case will the developer or owner responsible for the sanitary
sewer main extension subject to a rotary fee contract be eligible to recover
more than fifty percent (50%) of the actual final cost of the extension.
      (9)   No Rotary Fee is applicable for "Surface/Storm Water" collection 
systems. As no tap fee is currently assessed for surface water  connections,
any storm water drainage collection system installed by a developer is
understood to become Village property immediately upon acceptance by the
Village Administrator's office. 
      (10)   Collection of rotary fees, unless the collection period is
extended at Village Council's discretion as provided in subsection (b)(2)
hereof, shall terminate ten years from the date the original line subject to a
rotary fee contract is placed in service, or when the original developer has
received reimbursement of fifty percent (50%) of his costs from prior rotary
fees collected, whichever occurs first.  The date a party first requests
permission to tap a line subject to a rotary fee contract shall be documented
in writing on a request form submitted to the Village Administrator or the
Sewer Superintendent.  The request form shall be required before discussions
concerning tapping any Village line are undertaken.  Even if the exact course
or point of tapping or connection is not determined until a later time, and/or
the actual tap or connection is not made until a later time, the date used to
determine whether a rotary fee is to be assessed as falling within the ten year
limitation shall be the date the request form is submitted.
      (11)   The original developer or his/her/its heirs or assigns shall be
paid one-hundred percent (100%) of each rotary fee collected by the Village
under authority of subsection (b)(6) hereof, during the effective period of
that developer's rotary fee contract. Payment shall be made to original
developer within thirty days of the date the actual tap is made.
      (12)    Rotary fees will not apply to property owned by, or under the
control of the developer or any entity owned or controlled by developer that
the line or main was originally intended to serve. The Village shall not be
required to collect or pay rotary fees for taps to a line that serves a public
use or public facility, or for taps made by the Village to replace a sanitary
sewer line serving a customer who was receiving service from the Village prior
to the date of this agreement. The Village shall have the authority to
authorize taps to a line subject to a Rotary Fee Agreement which replaces a
line serving an existing customers without requiring payment of a rotary fee,
provided the replacement tap is no larger then the service tap being replaced.
      (13)    Other associated fees as may be applicable, including "Impact
Fees", if any, will be in addition to rotary fees, and no developer may waive
the imposition or collection of those fees. A developer may elect to waive the
collection of rotary fees to which they are entitled upon written notification
to the Village Clerk's office. Each property to which a fee is to be waived
will require separate notification for file purposes.
      (14)    Rotary fee agreements shall include a provision requiring the
developer to warrant the lines constructed by that developer against defects in
materials and errors in construction. Said warranty shall continue for a period
of one year from the date the lines are accepted by the Village and placed in
service. The developer shall make all repairs and corrections to said lines at
developer's cost during the warranty period. The Village reserves the right to
require the developer maintain a surety bond to guarantee that said repairs or
corrections will be satisfactorily completed.
         (Ord. 11-06.  Passed 5-3-11.)
915.32  EXTENSION OF SEWER SERVICES TO LANDS CONTIGUOUS TO  THE VILLAGE.
   (a)   If the lands to which sewer services are to be extended, service lines
are to be enlarged, or additional service lines are to be extended, are
contiguous to any land within the corporation limits of the Village, the owner
of said contiguous land must petition for annexation to the Village and
continue to exert all efforts to obtain annexation until such annexation is
complete before the property shall be eligible to receive sewer services. 
Village sewer services shall not be extended until the annexation has been
granted or until the annexation has been denied by the County Commissioners.
   (b)   If the owner's petition for annexation is denied by the County
Commissioners, the owner, prior to receiving sewer services, enlarged service
lines, or additional service lines, shall enter into a written agreement with
the Village providing that the owner will continue to exert all efforts to
obtain annexation of said contiguous property agreeing further that should the
owner sell such property or any part thereof to be served by sewer services
prior to annexation, the owner will require a similar agreement from any
purchaser of said land.  The owner further agrees to place a covenant in any
deed conveying any part of said property originally contiguous to the Village
of North Baltimore to which sewer services are extended, requiring that any
purchaser consent to and exert all efforts to complete annexation of said
property.
(Ord. 11-06.  Passed 5-3-11.)
915.33  EXTENSION OF SEWER SERVICES TO LANDS NOT CONTIGUOUS TO THE VILLAGE.
   If the lands to which sewer services are to be extended, service lines are
to be enlarged, or additional service are to be extended, are not contiguous to
the present Village corporation limits, before receiving said sewer service
enlargement of service lines, or additional service lines, the owner shall
enter into an agreement with the Village to exert all efforts to obtain
annexation of the property to be served by said services, including the signing
of a petition for annexation when it is legally possible to do so.  The owner
must also agree to require a similar agreement from any person or entity that
purchases any part of the property to be served by said services, further
agreeing to include in any deed conveying any interest in said real estate to
be served by said services, a covenant requiring the purchaser to consent to
and exert all efforts to complete annexation of said property when and if said
property becomes contiguous to the Village corporation limits or otherwise
becomes eligible for annexation. 
(Ord. 11-06.  Passed 5-3-11.)
915.34  INTENT TO SHARE TAX REVENUES ON ANNEXATION.
   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 709.19 specifying a transition period for the
sharing of taxes with a township on certain large territorial annexations, the
Village legislative authority desires to go on record as expressing its
intention to negotiate an agreement on the sharing of up to a maximum of one
hundred percent (100%) of property taxes, for a period up to a maximum of ten
years on property annexed from any adjacent township to the Village of North
Baltimore, which property is not already covered by a CEDA or JEDD agreement
with said township, provided such an agreement would not be contrary to law. 
The intent of this section is not to fix a specific percentage amount or
specific duration for the sharing of taxes, but to state an intention on the
part of the Village to negotiate in good faith with the township on the sharing
of property tax revenues to ease the effect on the township's budget caused by
property annexed to the Village of North Baltimore pursuant to Section
925.09 and
925.10.
(Ord. 11-06.  Passed 5-3-11.)
915.35  RIGHT-OF-ENTRY FOR INSPECTION.
   When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or
when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage
system, sanitary, combined or storm sewer system, the property owner shall
grant to the Village of North Baltimore the right to enter the property at
reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. 
This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to
believe that a violation of this ordinance is occurring or has occurred, and to
enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a
violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 11-06.  Passed 5-3-11.)
915.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Any Discharger who is found to have violated an Order of the Village
Administrator or his authorized representative or who has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, or orders of any court of competent jurisdiction
may be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined
in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation. 
Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate
offense.
   (b)   Any Discharger violating any of the provisions of this chapter, or who
discharges or causes damage to or impairs the Village wastewater disposal
system shall be liable to the Village for any expense, loss or damage caused by
such violation or discharge.  The Village Administrator or his authorized
representative shall bill the Discharger for the costs incurred by the Village
for any cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation or
discharge.  Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of
this chapter enforceable under the provisions of Section
915.09.
   (c)   Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
under this chapter, shall upon conviction, be punished by the imposition of a
penalty of not more that one thousand dollars ($1000) on a first offense.  A
second offense, and any subsequent offense within two years, shall constitute a
first-degree misdemeanor.  (Ord. 11-06.  Passed 5-3-11.)

   (b)   If the owner’s petition for annexation is denied by the County
Commissioners, the owner, prior to receiving sewer services, enlarged service
lines, or additional service lines, shall enter into a written agreement with
the Village providing that the owner will continue to exert all efforts to
obtain annexation of said contiguous property agreeing further that should the
owner sell such property or any part thereof to be served by sewer services
prior to annexation, that the owner will require a similar agreement from any
purchaser of said land.  The owner further agrees to place a covenant in any
deed conveying any part of said property originally contiguous to the Village
of North Baltimore to which sewer services are extended, requiring that any
purchaser consent to and exert all efforts to complete annexation of said
property.
(Ord. 05-94.  Passed 3-15-94.)
925.10  EXTENSION OF SEWER SERVICES TO LANDS NOT CONTIGUOUS TO THE VILLAGE.
   If the lands to which sewer services are to be extended, service lines are
to be enlarged, or additional service are to be extended, are not contiguous to
the present Village corporation limits, before receiving said sewer service
enlargement of service lines, or additional service lines, the owner shall
enter into an agreement with the Village to exert all efforts to obtain
annexation of the property to be served by said services, including the signing
of a petition for annexation when it is legally possible to do so.  The owner
must also agree to require a similar agreement from any person or entity that
purchases any part of the property to be served by said services, further
agreeing to include in any deed conveying any interest in said real estate to
be served by said services, a covenant requiring the purchaser to consent to
and exert all efforts to complete annexation of said property when and if said
property becomes contiguous to the Village corporation limits or otherwise
becomes eligible for annexation.  (Ord. 05-94.  Passed 3-15-94.)
925.11  INTENT TO SHARE TAX REVENUES ON ANNEXATION.
   Not withstanding Ohio R.C. 709.19 specifying a transition period for the
sharing of taxes with a township on certain large territorial annexations, the
Village legislative authority desires to go on records as expressing its
intention to negotiate an agreement on the sharing of up to a maximum of one
hundred percent (100%) of property taxes, for a period up to a maximum of ten
years on property annexed from any adjacent township to the Village of North
Baltimore, provided such an agreement would not be contrary to law.  The intent
of this section is not to fix a specific percentage amount or specific duration
for the sharing of taxes, but to state an intention on the part of the Village
to negotiate in good faith with the township on the sharing of property tax
revenues to ease the effect on the township’s budget caused by property annexed
to the Village of North Baltimore pursuant to Section
925.09  and
925.10 .  (Ord. 05-94.  Passed 3-15-94.)
925.99  PENALTY.

(Ord. 07-25.  Passed 9-18-07.)
935.04  POWERS OF THE VILLAGE ADMINISTRATOR.
   Storm water service charges levied pursuant to this chapter shall be billed
and collected by the Public Works Department.  The Village Administrator shall
make and enforce such rules and regulations as deemed necessary for the safe,
economical, and efficient management and protection of the Village’s storm
water system; for the construction and use of storm sewers and connections to
the storm water systems consistent with policies established by the Village
Council; and for the regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of such
storm water charges.  The Village Administrator shall track work activities and
expenses related to storm water management (street sweeping and catch basin
cleaning, repair, etc.) and compare them to the measurable goals and shall
report to the Village Council as to the financial status of the Storm Water
Utility Fund through monthly statements, or as otherwise requested by Council,
generated by the Clerk- Treasurer’s Office.

935.05  RATE STRUCTURE.
   (a)   A storm water service charge shall be billed to the owner of each and
every lot and parcel of land within the Village that contains impervious area
and contributes directly or indirectly to the storm water system of the
Village.  This charge is necessary to pay for the repair, replacement,
planning, design, regulations, education, coordination, improvement, operation,
inspection, maintenance, and enforcement of the existing and future storm water
system.  This charge is not related to water and/or sewer service and applies
whether or not the property is occupied.
   (b)   All properties having impervious area within the Village of North
Baltimore will be assigned an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) or a multiple
thereof, with all properties having any impervious area receiving at least one
(1) ERU as follows:
      (1)   All residential properties, as defined, will be assigned one (1)
ERU.  A flat rate will apply to all residential properties.
      (2)   All non-residential properties, as defined, will be assigned an ERU
multiple based upon the properties’ individually measured impervious area (in
square feet) divided by 3,000 square feet (1 ERU) but in no event less than one
(1) ERU.  This division will be calculated to the first decimal place and
rounded accordingly.
      (3)   The storm water charge shall be three dollars ($3.00) per month per
Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU).
      (4)   If it is determined that a residential or non-residential property
is directly discharging roof leaders, downspout connections and other clean
water connections to a combined/sanitary sewer, an additional charge of one
dollar ($1.00) per day will be added to the bill.  The property owner will be
given a reasonable time frame as directed by the Village Administrator to
remove said connection.  After that time frame the additional charge will be
added to the bill.  When the property owner removes said connections and the
removal is verified by the Village Administrator’s office, the additional storm
water charge will be removed.
         (Ord. 07-25.  Passed 9-18-07.)
935.06  STORM WATER ONLY ACCOUNTS.
   Storm water only accounts are properties that do not utilize water and/or
sanitary sewer services but do contain impervious area or hard surfaces and
contribute directly or indirectly to  the Village’s storm water system as
determined by the Village Administrator.  A copy of every permit issued by the
Village for new construction that does not utilize water and/or sanitary sewer
services shall be sent to the Village Administrator for a determination of
whether or not storm water service charges apply.
(Ord. 07-25.  Passed 9-18-07.)
   
935.07  BILLING AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.

holder that receives service;
   (d)   Bring an action at law for the collection of the delinquent amount;
   (e)   Certify the charges, together with any penalties, to the County
Auditor, who shall place the certified amount on the real property tax
duplicate of the property served directly or indirectly by the storm water
system of the Village.  The amount certified shall be a lien on the property
served from the date placed on the list and duplicate and shall be collected in
the same manner as other taxes, except that, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 323.15,
a County Treasurer shall accept a payment in such amount when separately
tendered as payment for the full amount of such unpaid storm water charges and
associated penalties.
      (Ord. 07-25.  Passed 9-18-07.)
935.09  ADJUSTMENTS.
   In the event the amount of impervious area on a non-residential property is
increased above that assigned by the Village Administrator, an adjustment may
be made to the ERU multiplier assigned to the property to properly reflect the
amount of impervious area.  The new ERU multiplier shall be billed from the
date on which the department mails a notification of the change to the owner of
the property and shall not be stayed by an appeal.  If the Village
Administrator finds that it has been under billing a non-residential property
as a result of the increase in impervious area, the owner may be charged for
the difference between the amount actually billed and the amount that should
have been billed for a period of time not to exceed one year prior to the date
of the mailing of the notification to the owner that an adjustment is being
made to the property’s ERU multiplier.  (Ord. 07-25.  Passed 9-18-07.)
935.10  RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   (a)   A non-residential property owner may challenge the ERU multiplier
assigned the property by filing an appeal with the Village Administrator for
adjustment thereof, stating in writing the grounds for the appeal.  The
Administrator shall cause the appropriate investigation thereof and report the
findings to the property owner.  The Administrator shall consider the appeal
and determine whether an adjustment of the ERU multiplier for any such lot or
parcel is necessary, and adjust such ERU multiplier if appropriate.
   (b)   If the property owner is not satisfied with the findings, an
administrative hearing may be requested in writing by the property owner to the
Village Administrator.  At the hearing, the property owner, the Administrator
and Village Engineer may present evidence to the Public Works Committee.  After
consideration, the Committee shall issue a written decision to the parties. 
This written decision shall be considered final.

         (Ord. 2018-07.  Passed 3-20-18.)
935.12  PROHIBITED STORM DRAINAGE CONNECTIONS.
   No person, firm or corporation shall drain storm water, surface water, or
water discharge from roof or footer drains into the Village sanitary sewage
system.
(Ord. 08-25.  Passed 7-1-08.)
935.13  OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO SEVER CONNECTIONS.
   Person(s) owning or having control of property in the Village shall be
required to sever all sources of storm or surface run off water currently
flowing through any lateral that carries sewage to the Village sanitary sewer
system.  If a separate storm sewer is made available by the Village, the person
(s) owning or having control of said property shall be responsible, at their
cost, for installing separate lateral storm sewer connections to divert storm
water, surface water, roof and footer drainage from their property, to the
separate Village storm sewer lines.  Available shall mean that said public
storm sewer line is located in the public right-of-way adjacent to said
property, or immediately across the street or alley right-of-way from said
property.  Owner’s cost shall include the expense of running the lateral to the
property line nearest the point where the Village has made a tap available to
connect to a sewer.  The Village shall bear the expense of making the necessary
connection with the available sewer, if the combined sanitary/storm sewer
connection pre-existed September 1, 2008.  If a combined connection did not
exist prior to September 1, 2008, it shall be the property owner’s
responsibility to pay the cost of the connection  or tap.  The tap or
connection fee shall be published in the Water/Sewer Fee and Penalty Schedule
approved by Council.  Said schedule is subject to change.  (Ord. 08-25.  Passed
7-1-08.)
935.14  APPROVED CONTRACTORS.
   The connection of sewer laterals to the Village sanitary or storm sewer
system and all construction within the Village right-of-way shall be performed
by a licensed contractor approved by the Village.  The list of approved
contractors will be maintained by the Village Administrator and shall be
available in the Village Clerk’s offices.  Construction of sanitary or storm
laterals on owner’s property must conform to Village specifications and must be
inspected and approved by the Village Administrator or the Village Sewer
Superintendent or his or her designated agent, before connection to the Village
sanitary or storm sewer system will be permitted.
(Ord. 08-25.  Passed 7-1-08.)
935.15  NO STORM SEWER AVAILABLE.
   If no separate storm sewer is available to carry storm or surface water from
an improved parcel of real property, it shall be the responsibility of the
person(s) owning or having control of said property to discharge storm water,
surface water, and water from roof and footer drains, to temporary storage
facilities on the property, or to divert said water to available open ditches
or swales designed to carry said storm or surface water off, to the end that
non-natural or excess accumulations of storm water generated by impervious
surfaces, such as roofs and paved areas on improved real property do not flow
onto, or damage adjacent property.  If no swales or ditches are available,
splash blocks for downspouts are recommended.  Sump water discharge should be
directed to seeded or planted areas on the respective property.  Under no
circumstances will discharge water be permitted to be discharged over
sidewalks, streets, alleys or other public rights of way in the Village,
thereby creating an unnecessary risk of harm to the public caused by
accumulations of water or ice.  (Ord. 08-25.  Passed 7-1-08.)
935.16  RIGHT TO INSPECT.
   The Village Administrator, the Village Public Works Superintendent, or an
authorized agent designated by the Administrator or Superintendent, shall be
assigned the duty to inspect and test private sanitary and storm lateral lines,
to verify that said lines are installed in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter; i.e. that there are no cross connections permitted untreated
sewage to flow into the storm sewer system, or cross connections permitting
storm water to flow into the sanitary storm sewer system.  If possible,
inspection and testing of private laterals shall be arranged by agreement with
the owner or person in control of the property.  If an agreement to inspect or
test can not be reached, notice of intent to inspect shall be given, in
writing, to the property owner or person in control of said property, at least
48 hours before a planned inspection  or test is to be conducted.  If the
property owner or person in control of the property refuses to allow the
inspection or test, the Village shall then serve notice that the lateral line
that could not be inspected or tested and will be disconnected on a date
specified in said notice, not more than 60 days from the date said notice is
served, unless suitable arrangements to complete the inspection or testing are
made.  If the lateral line is disconnected as a result of a failure or refusal
to allow inspection and testing, it shall not be reconnected until all costs
incurred to disconnect and reconnect the line, plus the cost of completing the
inspection and testing and of preparing and serving the required notices is
paid in full.
(Ord. 2018-07.  Passed 3-20-18.)
935.17  NON-COMPLIANCE.
   If a property owner refuses to comply with the provisions of these sections
requiring separation of Sanitary and Storm Water Sewers, the Village may
undertake necessary corrective measures to bring the property into compliance
and assess the costs of such corrective measures to the property owner. 
Property owners of new construction will be denied an occupancy permit by the
Village or County until such time as the property is determined to comply with
the provisions of sections requiring separation of Sanitary and Storm Water
Sewers.
(Ord. 08-25.  Passed 7-1-08.)
935.18  FEES AND PENALTIES.
   The initial inspection by the Village to determine compliance with this
chapter shall be conducted without a fee.  If subsequent visits are required to
inspect to verify compliance, or to take corrective measures, the property
owner will be responsible for a trip charge and hourly labor rate, according to
the most recent Water/Sewer Fee and Penalty Schedule adopted by Council.
(Ord. 08-25.  Passed 7-1-08.)
935.19  COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE.
   Compliance with the provisions of Sections
935.12  through

1, 2008: 360 days following the completion of construction of the Village
separated sewer system when located in the public right-of-way adjacent to said
property, or immediately across the street or alley right-of-way from said
property.  The Village shall notify the property owner(s) when construction is
completed in their area and the deadline for compliance.  Failure on the part
of the Village to provide reasonable notice shall not be a reason for
noncompliance.
   (c)   Construction or property improvements in existence prior to September
1, 2008 in an area not served, or planned to be served by the Village storm
sewer system: 360 days following the effective date of this legislation.  The
Village shall identify and notify all affected property owners of the deadline
for compliance within a reasonable time period following enactment of this
legislation.  Failure on the part of the Village to provide reasonable notice
shall not be a reason for non- compliance.  (Ord. 08-25.  Passed 7-1-08.)

the decedent’s Will, as part of the decedent’s residuary estate, or by the
intestate succession laws of the State of Ohio where no Will is found or
probated.
   (c)   Transfer and Assignment.
      (1)   No transfer or assignment of any burial space or interest therein
shall be valid unless the same shall be first approved in writing by an officer
of the Village.  The original deed of conveyance must be returned to the
Village with the request for assignment.  If the original deed of conveyance
cannot be located, an affidavit signed by all surviving owners of the burial
space or plot,  or if no surviving owners, by the Executor or Administrator or
Commissioner appointed by the Probate Court of the deceased owner’s estate, or
by such other person who establishes by evidence satisfactory to the Village
and its legal counsel that said person has authority to assign or transfer said
burial space, must be filed stating that said original deed of conveyance
cannot be found.  The Village shall then issue a new deed of conveyance to the
new owner or owners.
      (2)   A written statement with a notarized signature is required for all
transfers of ownerships.  The transfer of ownership shall be subject to a
transfer fee, as provided in the Village schedule of charges for transfer. 
   (d)   Transfers from Deceased Lot Owners.
      (1)   Transfers of graves from the estates of deceased lot owners shall
be effected in the following manner; the executor or administrator shall
present the original deed for cancellation.  He/she shall also present an Order
of Distribution from the Probate Court designating the graves to be distributed
to each heir named in the Order, together with a Release from Inheritance Tax
issued by the Department of Taxation. 
      (2)   If the person or persons shown as Owners in the Village records of
any unused lots or burial sites are deceased, no further burials in said unused
sites shall be permitted until said used sites are properly transferred on the
Village records, following the procedures set forth in the preceding section
entitled "Transfer and Assignment". 
      (3)   Should an emergency arise that results in a request to use a
previously deeded but unused burial site, and all of the owners of record are
deceased and said available burial site has not yet been transferred as set
forth above, the Mayor or acting Mayor of the Village shall have absolute
discretion to refuse further burials until the transfer is completed, or to
permit the burial to proceed subject to the following terms and conditions. 
         A.   Evidence shall be provided that is satisfactory to the Village
and its legal counsel that the transfer or assignment of said unused burial
site is in process and will be completed.
         B.   The Mayor or acting Mayor of the Village shall have the right in
his or her sole discretion to require the posting of a bond (in cash or with
sureties satisfactory to the Village), and in an amount to be determined by the
Mayor or acting Mayor and the Village legal counsel.  The bond, if one is
required, shall be in an amount sufficient to pay costs, including legal
expenses incurred by the Village should a dispute over the right to use said
available but untransferred burial site arise before the transfer is completed;
the  cost or probable cost of disinterment and re-interment of the deceased;
and the cost of setting or resetting any stones or monuments should a dispute
arise requiring said disinterment, etc.
   (e)   Change of Address.  It shall be the duty of the plot owners to notify
the Village of any change in their post office address.  Notice sent to a plot
owner at the last address on file in the office of the Village shall be
considered sufficient and proper legal notification.
(Ord. 00-35.  Passed 10-17-00.)
951.02  FUNERALS, INTERMENTS AND DISINTERMENTS.
   (a)   Time and Manner.  All interments, disinterments and removals shall be
made by Village employees at the time, in the manner, and subject to the
payment of such charges as are fixed by the Village.  Tents, artificial grass,
lowering devices, and other equipment of the Funeral Director shall be used
exclusively in making interments, disinterments and removals.
   (b)   Notice and Required Information.  The right is reserved by the Village
to require twenty-four (24) hours notice before any interment and one weeks’
notice before disinterment or removal.  No interment will be permitted until
the Village has received the burial permit and such other information as is
required to complete the Cemetery Interment Record.  Due to inclement weather
or circumstances beyond its control, the Village reserves the right to schedule
the interment at its discretion.  All graves will be opened and closed during
normal working hours.  Openings and closings other than normal working hours
shall be subject to published charges.  Funeral Directors wishing to have work
done during other than normal working hours will be subject to overtime charges
for Cemetery employees, and may only do so with prior approval of the Cemetery
Superintendent.
   (c)   Funerals.
      (1)   The Funeral Director will lead all funeral processions from the
cemetery main entrance to the burial lot.  The Village Administrator or his
authorized representative is expected to attend every interment and see that
the rules, regulations and strict proprieties of the cemetery are observed.
      (2)   The casket in every earth interment shall be enclosed in a vault of
concrete, steel or other material which is approved by the Village. 
      (3)   Funeral directors shall be responsible for the delivery and
installation of vaults.  Vault delivery and installation shall be done in a
manner so as to leave no ruts or depression in grounds or damage to supervise
all vault installations.  It shall be the responsibility of the Funeral
Director to repair or replace any damage caused by their employees during
interment, or caused by employees or agents of vault companies.  If the Village
Administrator or his authorized representative or Funeral Director should
discover upon opening a gravesite that the area is too small to accommodate an
adult size vault or casket any or all expenses for replacing such with a
smaller vault or casket will be born by the family members involved and not at
an expense to the Village.
   (d)   Open and Closing of Grave.  The Village Administrator or his
authorized representative will be responsible for opening and closing of
graves; Funeral Directors will be responsible for attendant services.  No
graves shall be opened or closed, except on a permit issued by the Clerk and
under the supervision of the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative.  The work shall be done by Cemetery employees under the
supervision of the Village Administrator or his authorized representative.
   (e)   Protests to Interments.    All protests to interments must be made in
writing in such form as is requested by the Association and filed in the office
of the Village.  Where a protest is filed, the Village shall have the right to
place the body in a receiving vault until the rights of the parties have been
determined and the Village shall not be liable for the delay of the interment.
   (f)   Interment of More Than One Body.  The interment of only one body will
be permitted in a grave, provided that with the consent of the Village, a
mother and infant, or two children in a casket, may be interred in one grave. 
In such cases of multiple interments, proper identification shall be made on
one regulation memorial.
   (g)   Removal.  An interment properly made shall not be disturbed except on
written permission of the original plot owner and the written consent of the
Village Council or upon an order of court of competent jurisdiction.  Removal
of a body or cremated remains by the heirs so the plot may be sold for profit
to themselves is prohibited; however, consent of the Village will be granted
provided such removal does not violate the expressed written wish of the
original plot owner.  (Ord. 00-35.  Passed 10-17-00.)

damage from causes beyond reasonable control, and especially from damage caused
by the elements, an act of God, common enemy, thieves, vandals, strikers,
malicious insurrection, riots or order of any military or civil authority,
whether the damage be direct or collateral.  The Village shall not be liable to
any person for the failure to comply with the regulations in any interment or

deceased, or for the damage to a casket, burial vault or urn in an authorized
removal.

event, at any time, on its judgement, they become unsightly to the eye.
      (2)   No work of any description shall be done or no article shall be

where there is a failure to conform to the applicable rules and regulations, or

   (a)   Appeals. An appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning

person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Inspector. The appeal shall be
submitted within twenty working days after the decision, by filing with the
Zoning Inspector and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds
upon which the appeal is being taken. The Zoning Inspector shall transmit to
the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken.
      (1)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in the furtherance of the
action appealed from unless the Zoning Inspector shall certify to the Board
after the notice of appeal has been filed with him that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the opinion of the Zoning
Inspector, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by restraining order which may be granted by the
Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Inspector
from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.
      (2)   The Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Code, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement

the premises; and to that end, shall have all powers of the Zoning Inspector
from whom the appeal is taken.
   (b)   Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this Zoning Code as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code would result in unnecessary
hardship. No nonconforming use in the same district and no permitted or
nonconforming use in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance
of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Code
would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit and purpose of
this Zoning Code shall be observed and justice done. A variance from the terms
of this Zoning Code shall not be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless
and until a written application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning
Inspector and the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)   No variance in the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code
shall be authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless the Board finds that
all the following facts and conditions exist.
         A.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning
district.
         B.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Code would deprive the applicant of rights enjoyed by other properties in this
Zoning Code.
         C.   The special conditions and circumstances did not result from the
actions of the applicant.
         D.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Code to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district.
      (2)   In exercising its power, the Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of statutes and of this Zoning Code, reverse or affirm wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination
as ought to be made, and to that end, shall have all powers of the office from
whom the appeal is taken.
      (3)   In authorizing a variance, under no circumstances shall the Board
grant an appeal or variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of
this Zoning Code in the district involved, or any use prohibited by the terms
of this Zoning Code in the district. In granting any appeal or variance, the
Board may attach thereto such conditions and safeguards with respect to the
location, character, and other features of the proposed structure, or use as it
may deem necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purpose of this
Zoning Code; and in the public interest. Violation of these conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is

certification to local officials by the Director of Transportation, or within a
radius of 500 feet from the point of intersection of the centerline with any

Director of Transportation and the property owner, the Village Council shall
proceed as required by law.  (Ord. 10-03.  Passed 3-16-10.)

to the date of hearing to the owners of all properties within, contiguous to,
and directly across the street from the area proposed to be rezoned or

1123.01  OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The zoning districts established in Section
1123.02 are bounded and defined by the map entitled "Official Zoning District
Map" which together with all explanatory matter thereon are hereby adopted as
part of this Zoning Code.
   (a)   The Official Zoning District Map shall be located in the office of the
Zoning Inspector, and signed by the Mayor, attested by the Clerk of Council,
and bear the seal of the Village.
   (b)   No amendment to this Zoning Code which involves matter portrayed on
the Official District Map shall become effective until after the change and
entry has been made on the Map.
   (c)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
Zoning Code.
   (d)   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official
District Map which may from time to time be made or published, the Official
District Map shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of
land and water areas, buildings, and other structures.
   (e)   In the event the Official District Map becomes damaged, destroyed, or
lost, the Village Council may, by resolution, adopt a new Official District Map
which shall supersede the prior Official District Map. The new Official
District Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior
Official District Map, but no corrections shall have the effect of amending the
original Zoning Code or subsequent amendments thereof.

reserved. Creation of or transition to such a use in a district for which it is
principally permitted requires that a zoning certificate be obtained. Chapter
1125 lists principally permitted uses for each individual district. For
information regarding zoning certificates, see Section
1107.02.
 
   (b)   A conditionally permitted use is a conforming use within a district,

1109.03.
1123.04  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   The district boundary lines on the District Map are intended to follow

designated on the Map or bounded approximately by the street, alley, or lot
lines, the street, alley, or lot shall be construed to be the boundary of the
district, unless the boundary is otherwise indicated on the Map. In the case of
unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines shall be determined by the
use of the scale appearing on the Zoning District Map or by dimensions.
   (b)   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, the boundary
shall be deemed to be located midway between the main tracks of the railroad

1129.01 INTENT.
   The intent of the planned unit development (PUD) regulations is to permit
greater flexibility and consequently, more creative and imaginative design for
the development of residential areas than is possible under conventional zoning
regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient
use of the land while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a
higher level of urban amenities, and preservation of natural scenic qualities
of open spaces.
1129.02  CONFLICT.
   Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
section and those of the other sections of this Zoning Code, the provisions of
this section shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this section shall be
governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this Zoning Code.
1129.03  PERMITTED USES.
   Any use permitted in the R-3 District of this Zoning Code shall be permitted
in a PUD. Nonresidential uses shall be permitted upon approval of the Planning
Commission.
1129.04  OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS.
   An application for approval of a PUD may be filed by a person having an
interest in the property to be included in the planned unit. The PUD
application shall be filed in the name or names of the recorded owner or owners
of the property included in the development. However, the applications may be
filed by a holder or holders of an equitable interest in the property. The
applicant must show evidence of full ownership interest in the land (legal
title or the execution of a binding sales agreement) before final approval of
his plan. When a joint application is made for a PUD, the project must be in
single ownership by the time the final development plan is approved.
1129.05  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Minimum Project Area.  Minimum area for a PUD District shall be three
contiguous acres. When the PUD proposes a mixture of residential uses with
commercial or industrial uses, the Planning Commission may limit the
development of not more than twelve percent (12%) of the tract to commercial
uses and not more than 10% of the tract to industrial uses.
   (b)   Relation to Streets. The PUD District shall be so located with respect
to major streets and highways or other transportation facilities as to provide
direct access to the districts without creating traffic along minor streets in
residential neighborhoods outside the District.
   (c)   Utilities. The PUD District shall be so located in relation to
sanitary sewers, water lines, storm and surface drainage systems, and other
utilities systems and installations that neither extension nor enlargement of
the systems will be required by the Village. However, the developer may install
utility lines at his expense upon approval of the appropriate agencies.
   (d)   Common Open Space. A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the land
developed in any PUD shall be reserved for common open space and recreational
facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed. Every
property developed under the PUD should be designed to abut upon common open
space or similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is encouraged. In areas where
townhouses are used, there shall be no more than eight townhouse units in any
contiguous group.
   (e)   Disposition of Open Space.  The required amount of common open space
land reserved under a PUD shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners
of the project area for the use of each owner who buys property within the
development or be dedicated to the Village and retained as common open space
for parks, recreation, and related uses. All land dedicated to the Village must
meet the Planning Commission's requirements as to size, shape, and location.
Public utility and similar easements and rights of way for watercourses and
other similar channels are not acceptable for common open space dedication to
the Village unless the land or right of way is usable as a trail or similar
purpose and approved by the Planning Commission. The responsibility for the
maintenance of all open spaces shall be specified by the developer before
approval of the final development plan.
   (f)   Minimum Lot Sizes.
      (1)   Lot area per dwelling unit may be reduced by not more than forty
percent (40%) of the minimum lot area required in Chapter
1127. A diversification of lot sizes is encouraged.
      (2)   Lot width may be varied to allow for a variety of structural
designs. It is also recommended that setbacks be varied.
   (g)   Height Requirements. For each foot of building height over the maximum
height regulations specified in Chapter
1127, the distance between these buildings and the side and rear property line
of the PUD project area shall be increased by a one-foot addition to the side
and rear yard required in the districts.
1129.06  COMMERCIAL USES.
   (a)   When PUDs include commercial uses, commercial buildings and
establishments shall be planned as groups having common parking areas and
common ingress and egress points in order to reduce the number of potential
accident locations at intersections with streets. Planting screens or fences
shall be provided on the perimeter of the commercial areas abutting residential
areas.
   (b)   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of building, and for adequate and properly arranged
facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping, and such other
features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and
efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial
areas.
   (c)   All areas designed for further expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner as specified by the Planning Commission.
1129.07  INDUSTRIAL USES.
   (a)   PUDs may include industrial uses if it can be shown that the
development results in a more desirable use of land.
   (b)   Industrial uses and parcels shall be developed in park like
surroundings utilizing landscaping and existing woodland as buffers to screen
lighting, parking area, loading areas or docks, or outdoor storage of raw
materials or products. A planned industrial area shall provide for the harmony
of buildings and a compact grouping in order to economize in the provision of
the utility services as required.
   (c)   Project side yards of forty feet and a rear yard of fifty feet shall
be required if the project is located adjacent to any residential use. All
intervening spaces between the right-of- way line and project building line and
intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas, and improved areas
shall be landscaped with trees and plantings and properly maintained at all
times.
1129.08  PRE-APPLICATION MEETING.
   The developer shall meet with the Zoning Inspector and Planning Commission
prior to the submission of the preliminary development plan. The purpose of
this meeting is to discuss early and informally the purpose and effect of this
Zoning Code and the criteria and standards contained herein, and to familiarize

1137.01  INTENT.
   It is recognized that at the time of the adopting of this Zoning Code or any
of its subsequent amendments, there shall exist lots, uses of land, structures,
and uses of structures and land in combination which do not conform to this
Zoning Code. While such conditions are permitted to continue, the purpose of
this Zoning Code is to alleviate and eventually eliminate the undesirable
consequences resulting from nonconforming lots, uses of land, structures, and
uses of structures and land in combination which are detrimental to the purpose
of this Zoning Code.
1137.02  AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code deemed to require a
change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Code and upon which actual building construction
has been carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has begun
preparatory to rebuilding, the demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction, provided that the work shall be carried out diligently.
1137.03  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   Any lot of record existing at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning
Code or any of its subsequent amendments which does not conform to the lot
requirements of the district in which it is located is to be considered a
nonconforming lot of record.
   (a)   Single Nonconforming Lots of Record .
      (1)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single- family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code notwithstanding limitations imposed by this Zoning Code. The lot
must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in
the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to
meet the requirements for area or width or both, that are applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which the lot is located.
      (2)   Variances of yard requirements of this Zoning Code other than lot
area or lot width shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals as provided in Section
1109.02.
   (b)    Nonconforming Lots of Record in Combination. If two or more lots or a
combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Zoning Code
and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area, the land involved shall be considered to be
an undivided parcel for the purpose of this Zoning Code and no portion of it
shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width
and area requirements established by this Zoning Code, nor shall any division
of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the
requirements stated in this Zoning Code.
1137.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code that could not be built under the terms of this
Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, the
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise unlawful subject to
the following provisions.
   (a)   No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   Should the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Should the structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
1137.05  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this Zoning Code lawful uses of land exist
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning Code,
the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)   No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   No nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by the uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   If any nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned or
more than two years (except when government action impedes access to the
premises), any subsequent use of the land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this Zoning Code for the district in which the land is located.
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with a nonconforming use of land.
1137.06  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and land
in combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the
Zoning Code that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
Zoning Code the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of the
building which was arranged or designed for the use at the time of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code, but no nonconforming use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside the building.
   (c)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is changed to a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use shall not
thereafter be resumed.
   (d)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination is discontinued or abandoned for more than two years (except when
government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure
and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (e)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (f)   A nonconforming residential use in a business district shall be
permitted to continue as if they were in a residential district. The use must
comply with the requirements of an R-1 Residential District. However, the use
shall not be expanded into a combination business and residential use. Before
the building is altered to be used for a business, the State Building Code,
Fire Code, and all other applicable codes must be met.
1137.07  CHANGE IN NONCONFORMING USES.
   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure
or structure and land, may, upon appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, be
changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board shall find that
the proposed use is equal or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting the change, the Board may require certain
conditions and safeguards.
1137.08  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this. section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
the official.
1137.09  CERTIFICATE OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   Upon the effective date of this Zoning Code, the Zoning Inspector shall
issue a certificate of nonconforming use to all owners of property, the use of
which does not conform to the district regulations in which the property is
located. Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under
the terms of this Zoning Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in the
district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.

occupations which are compatible with the neighborhoods in which they are

materials, construction, lighting, signs, or the emission of sounds, noises, or
vibrations.
   (d)   An accessory building may be used for a home occupation, but the area
used in the accessory building shall be used in determining the time/space
ratio.

conditions and safeguards with respect to location, construction, maintenance,
and operation, in addition to those stipulated in this Zoning Code for the
particular home occupation permit as the Board may deem necessary for the
protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the home
occupation is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code and
punishable under Section
1107.99. The Board may also require such evidence and a guarantee or bond as it

decision shall be incorporated in the permit to the applicant or appellant,
whenever a permit is authorized by the Board.

of five days from the date the decision is made, unless the Board shall find
that the immediate taking effect of the decision is necessary for the
preservation of property or personal rights, and shall so certify on the
record.
1143.05  EXPIRATION OF HOME OCCUPATION PERMIT.
   A home occupation permit shall be deemed to authorize only one particular
home occupation and the permit shall automatically expire, if for any reason,

consideration. The Board may without further hearing revoke any home occupation
permit for noncompliance with the conditions set forth in the approved original
permit. Any permit revoked by the Board may not be resubmitted for a period of

   (a)   Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary and unnecessary
hardship may result from strict compliance with these regulations, due to
exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, it may vary the
regulations so as to relieve such hardship, provided such relief may be granted
without detriment to the public interest and without impairing the intent and
purpose of these regulations or the desirable development of the neighborhood
and community. Such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of these regulations, the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or the
zoning regulation, if such exist.
   (b)   In granting variances or modifications, the Planning Commission may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objective of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.
1161.07  APPEAL.

   (a)   Whomever violates any rule or regulation adopted by the Village
Council for the purpose of setting standards and requiring and securing the
construction of improvements within a subdivision or fails to comply with any
order pursuant thereto is creating a public nuisance and the creation thereof
may be enjoined and maintenance thereof may be abated by action at suit of the
Village or any citizen thereof. Whoever violates these regulations shall
forfeit and pay not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). Such sum may be recovered with costs in a civil action in
the Court of Jurisdiction of the Village. Each day that a violation is

recorded in the office of the County Recorder, that person shall forfeit and
pay the sum of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each lot, parcel, or tract of land so sold. The
description of such lot, parcel, or tract by metes and bounds in the deed or
transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the forfeiture provided in
this section.

located outside of the road or street right-of-way. This easement shall be
shown on the final plat and/or the construction drawings and labeled "Storm
Sewer Easement".
1164.03  DRAINAGE CALCULATIONS.
   (a)   Verification of Proposed Hydraulic Design. A professional engineer,
licensed to practice in Ohio, shall submit storm calculations and drainage maps
of sufficient scale and contour interval to verify the proposed hydraulic
design. A map indicating specific drainage basins shall be submitted.
   (b)   Surface Run-off. Surface run-off quantity shall be determined by one
of the following methods:
      (1)   100 acres or less - Rational Method (Q = CIA).
Where:   Q = the peak run-off rate, and
C = the run-off coefficient (assumed to be dimension-less).
Note: The run-off coefficient can be assumed to be dimension-less because 1.0
acre-inch/hour is equivalent to 1.008 cubic feet per second (Ft3/sec or cfs).
I  = the average rainfall intensity (in/hr) lasting for a critical period time.
A = the size of the drainage area in acres.
         A.   Intensity of precipitation for any given storm duration
(concentration time off). Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) curves show
the average precipitation intensity of storms of two, five, ten, twenty-five,
fifty and 100- year frequencies. These values may be used for drainage
calculations using the Rational Method for tributary areas of 100 acres or
less.
         B.   Inlet time. At the head of the system the inlet may vary from
five to twenty minutes, depending upon the size of the area and factors
affecting rapid run-off.
         C.   Run-off coefficient. Compute a weighted value of the drainage
areas, using generally accepted engineering criteria.
      (2)   More than 100 acres - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release No. 55, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service.
1164.04  SYSTEM SIZING.
   Proper engineering calculations shall be used to determine pipe, culvert,
ditch, orifice and inlet Control devices sizing.
   (a)   Mannings equation may be used to size pipes, culverts and ditches, as
follows:
            Q = (1.49/n) AR - S 1´2
      
Where:    Q = discharge (cfs)
n = Manning's roughness coefficient
A = Cross-sectional area (SF)
R = the hydraulic radius
Note:    R = wetted perimeter/cross-sectional area
S = Slope of the channel or pipe (ft/ft)
   (b)   The size of storm lines shall be determined on the basis of the
hydraulic gradient to provide adequate capacity of the computed run-off, using
n=0.015 for vitrified clay and concrete pipe, bituminous paved corrugated metal
pipe plan 0.024, paved invert 0.020, asphalt spun 0.0 13, and brick sewers and
n=0.0 13 for monolithic concrete sewers.
   (c)   All storm sewers shall be designed with a hydraulic slope sufficient
to provide a mean velocity when flowing full, of not less than three feet per
second. Where the velocity exceeds twelve feet per second, special provisions
shall be made to protect against erosion and displacement.
   (d)   All storm sewers shall be properly sized, but in no case shall the
size of the lines be less than twelve inches in diameter.
      (1)   All storm sewers shall be sized to flow approximately full for a
five yerar storm. The size shall be determined by working downstream from the
inlet of the first sewer run.
      (2)   The hydraulic gradient for a ten year storm shall be kept below the
catch basin grates in all cases. This will eliminate storm water being detained
on the pavement surface during this period.
   (e)   The design frequency to be used for an individual structure and/or
system may be altered by the Village where the health and safety of the
residents would be endangered by the hazards of flood waters or increased
flows. Minimum depth for storm sewers shall be planned to provide clearance for
all utilities and to permit inlet leads to be laid on not less than one percent
(1%) slope.
   (f)   When storm sewers are increased in size in the direction of flow, the
invert of the smaller pipe shall be lowered to maintain the same energy
gradient (place the crowns of both pipes at the same elevation). A larger pipe
shall not discharge into a smaller pipe unless specifically approved by the
Village.
   (g)   All drainage structures and appurtenances shall comply with applicable
Village specifications and/or the most current addition of ODOT's Construction
and Materials Specification and Standard Construction Drawings. Any discrepancy
between the two shall be decided by the Village.
1164.05  STORM WATER RETENTION/DETENTION.
   (a)   Maximum Discharge Levels. All sections of this chapter are hereby
qualified to prevent damages caused by accelerated storm water runoff,
increased peak rates of runoff and volumes of runoff from developing areas.
Storm water runoff shall be controlled, such that in no event shall the post
development storm discharge exceed the pre-development discharge quantity at
any point along the boundary of the development.
   (b)   Calculations.
      (1)   The volume, in cubic feet, of a retention/detention pond, shall be
calculated as follows:
         A.   The peak rate of runoff from a Critical Storm (as determined
below) and all more frequent storms occurring on the development area does not
exceed the peak rate of runoff from a two year storm (in cfs) (Q2) over the
same area under pre-development conditions.
         B.   Storms of less frequent occurrence than the Critical Storm, up to
the one hundred (100) year storm, have peak runoff rates no greater than the
peak runoff rate from an equivalent year storm under pre-development
conditions.
      (2)   The Critical Storm for a specific development area is determined as
follows:
         A.   Determine by appropriate hydrologic methods the total volume of
runoff from a two year storm occurring over the development area before and
after development.
         B.   From the volumes determined in subsection (b)(2)A. hereof,
determine the percentage increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using
this percentage, select the Critical Storm from the following table:

      (3)   Retention/detention storage volumes shall be calculated by Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) TR-55 or other approved methods.
      (4)   Retention/detention storage outlet pipes shall be designed for
discharge based on the runoff as calculated in subsection (b) hereof.
      (5)   Storage volume does not have to be provided for runoff from off-
site upstream areas. Upstream runoff should be conveyed through the site in
accordance with the current runoff conditions.
      (6)   No on-site drainage shall outlet downstream of the main retention/
detention facility without providing supplemental retention/detention as per
the above criteria, or an equivalent reduction in the retention/detention
outlet.
      (7)   An overflow outlet shall be incorporated in the design of
detention/retention basins to protect the surrounding structures in the event
of an overflow.
      (8)   Maximum slope of the basin shall be a 3:1 grade.
CHAPTER 1165
Wind Turbines
1165.01   General provisions.
1165.02   Permits and penalties.
 
 
1165.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The Village of North Baltimore recognizes the importance of clean,
sustainable and renewable energy sources.  To that end, the Village of North
Baltimore permits the use of residential wind turbines under the following
regulations to ensure the safety and welfare of all Village residents.
   (a)   Wind turbines shall be a permitted use in all districts under the
following conditions:
      (1)   The maximum height of any turbine shall be 100 feet. For purposes
of this particular zoning item, maximum height shall be considered the total
height of the turbine system including the tower, and the maximum vertical
height of the turbine's blades.  Maximum height therefore shall be calculated
by measuring the length of the prop at maximum vertical rotation to the base of
the tower.
      (2)   Setbacks:  the following shall apply in regards to setbacks:
         Any turbine erected on a parcel of land will need to establish a
"clear fall zone" from all neighboring property lines, structures, as well as
any inhabited structures on the parcel intended for the turbine.  A turbine
will need to be erected and place in such a manner that if it were to fall,
whatever the direction the fall occurs would be contained solely on the
property where the turbine is located at, and would not strike any structures
including the primary dwelling, and any inhabited structures.
      (3)   Maintenance:
         Wind turbines must be maintained in good working order.  Turbines that
become inoperable for more that twenty-four months must be removed by the owner
within thirty days of issuance of a zoning violation.  Removal includes removal
of all apparatuses, supports, and/or other hardware associated with the
existing turbine.
      (4)   Decibel Levels:
         All units shall operate within a decibel range of 50 to 70 decibels. 
This information shall be included in the engineering report described below in
Section
1165.02 of this document.  This information shall be obtained from the
manufacturer of the turbine, and all decibel readings, if necessary shall be
taken from the nearest neighboring property.
      (5)   Wiring and Electrical Apparatuses:
         All wires and electrical apparatuses associated with the operation of
a wind turbine shall be located underground.
1165.02  PERMITS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Permits.
      (1)   A permit shall be required before construction can commence on an
individual wind turbine system.
      (2)   As part of the permit process, the applicant shall inquire with the
Wood County Planning Commission as to whether or not additional height
restrictions are applicable due to the unit's location.
      (3)   Applicant shall then provide the Zoning Inspector with the
following items and or information when applying for a permit:
         A.   Location of all public and private utilities in relation to the
location of the turbine.
         B.   An engineering report that shows:
            1.   Total size and height of the unit.
            2.   Total size and depth of the unit's concrete mounting pad, as
well as soil and bedrock data.
            3.   A list and or depiction of all safety measures that will be on
the unit including anti-climb devices, grounding devices and lightning
protection.
            4.   Data specifying the kilowatt size and generating capacity of
the particular unit.
            5.   The maximum decibel level of the particular unit.  This
information must be obtained from the manufacturer of the turbine unit.
         C.   A site drawing showing the location of the unit in relation to
existing structures on the property, roads and other public right of ways, and
neighboring properties.
         D.   Evidence of a "clear fall zone" with manufacturer's
recommendation must be attached to the engineering report.
         E.   A maintenance schedule as well as a dismantling plan that
outlines how the unit will be taken apart shall be required as part of the
permit.
   (b)   Penalties. Violations and penalties shall be addressed according to
Section
1107.99  of the Village of North Baltimore Code.

1301.01  PERMITTING UNCLEAN HABITATIONS.
   No person shall lease, let, permit the occupancy of, permit the continuation
of the occupancy of, or continue the occupancy of any structure or building or
any portion thereof, used for human habitation, unless such structure or
building or portion thereof be free from unclean and unsanitary conditions, as
defined in the subsequent sections of this chapter and unless the provisions of
said subsequent sections are complied with.
1301.02  BASIC STANDARDS.
   (a)   Any structure or building or any portion thereof used for human
habitation shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition by
reason of any portion of such building being infected with a communicable
disease, or by reason of the absence therein of toilet facilities as required
by law or ordinance, or by reason of the known presence of sewer gas therein or
thereon.
   (b)   Any structure or building or any portion thereof used for human
habitation shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition when
unfit for human habitation or in a condition dangerous or harmful to the lives
or health of the occupants by reason of the inhabited portion of the house
being damp or wet or by reason of such lack of repair, or by reason of such
accumulation of dirt, filth, litter, refuse or other offensive or dangerous
substances or liquids, or by reason of such defects in or lack of repair of or
improper use of the drainage, plumbing or ventilation, or by reason of the
existence on the premises of such a nuisance or other condition as is likely to
cause sickness among the occupants.  Any structure or building or any portion
thereof, used for human habitation which is in such unclean or unsanitary
condition is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance.
1301.03  ORDER FOR ABATEMENT OR VACATION OF PREMISES.
   Whenever the County Board of Health ascertains from examination or reports
of its inspectors or sanitary officers or otherwise that a public nuisance
exists, as defined in Section
1301.02  in or upon any structure or building, or portion thereof, and is of
the opinion that such nuisance is capable of being abated without immediate
vacation of the premises or such portion thereof, and serves notice upon the
owner of such house, or his lessee or agent, or the person is possession,
charge or control thereof directing him to abate such nuisance and remove the
unclean or unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by
said Board and specified in said notice, it shall then be the duty of such
owner, agent or person to abate such nuisance within such time.  Whenever such
abatement does not take place within such time, or whenever  in the opinion of
said Board such abatement is impossible or impracticable without an immediate
vacation of the house or portion thereof, and said board serves notice upon the
owner, lessee, agent, or person in possession, charge or control thereof to
vacate or cause the vacation of such house or portion thereof designated in the
notice, then it shall be the duty of such owner, lessee, agent or person to
vacate or cause the vacation of such house or portion thereof within twenty
days from the date of the service of such notice, or within a shorter time (not
less than twenty-four hours in any case) as may be specified in said notice. 
Whenever, either in addition to or without the service of said notices on said
owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control, the said Board
is of the opinion that such nuisance can be abated by a tenant or other
occupant of such house or portion thereof, and such notices, either for
abatement of the nuisance or of vacation of the premises, are served upon such
tenant or other occupant, then it shall be the duty of such tenant or other
occupant to comply with the terms of such notices and to abate the nuisance or
vacate the premises accordingly. After any such notice or order of vacation it
shall be unlawful to occupy or permit the occupancy of such premises or portion
thereof until such nuisance shall have been completely abated and such building
or portion thereof shall have been rendered clean and sanitary in accordance
with the terms of said notices of the Board of Health.  When there is no owner,
agent, lessee or person in charge, possession or control, who is a resident of
or can be served in the municipality, then personal service outside of said
municipality on any such owner, agent, lessee or person in charge, possession
or control by anyone delegated by said Board of Health to make such service, or
by registered letter, or if the address of the owner, lessee, agent or person
in possession, charge or control be unknown, or service be not secured by
registered letter after effort to do so, by notice by publication once a week
for two consecutive weeks in any newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality, or posting or attaching to or on the outside of said structure or
building of a copy of the notice or order consecutively for two weeks, shall
have the same effect as service within said municipality.
1301.04  VACATION AND ABATEMENT HEARINGS.
   When the notice or order of vacation follows a notice or order of abatement,
as provided in Section
1301.03 , such notice or order of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in
this chapter, unless said notice or order of abatement specifies a time when
the person so notified or ordered may appear before the Board or officer
issuing the same to show cause why such order or notice of vacation should not
be issued, and unless said Board (or a majority thereof) or officer is present
at its or his office at the time so specified; such time to be not less than
twenty-four hours after the service of the notice or order.  When the notice or
order of vacation is issued as provided in Section
1301.03  of this chapter, without a previous notice or order of abatement, such
notice or order of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in this chapter
unless it specifies a time, not less than five days after the service thereof,
when the person so notified or ordered may appear before the Board issuing the
same to show cause why such notice or order should not be enforced, and said
Board or a majority thereof is present at its office at the time so specified;
provided; than when, in the opinion of at least four-fifths of the members of
such Board, an emergency exists which requires, for the protection of the
health of occupants, the vacation of the building or portion thereof without a
delay of five days, then no such fixing of a time for hearing shall be
required.
1301.05  POSTING NOTICE OF VACATION.
   Whenever such procedure, in the opinion of the Board of Health is desirable
or necessary, said Board of Health may affix conspicuously on the buildings or
part thereof the notice or order of vacation.
1301.06  ENFORCEMENT OF VACATION ORDER BY CHIEF OF POLICE.
   When the notice or order of vacation has not been complied with, and the
Board of Health certifies such fact to the Police Chief, together with a copy
of the order or notice, it shall be the duty of said Police Chief to enforce
such notice or order of vacation and to cause the said premises to be vacated
in accordance with the terms of such notice or order.
1301.07  ENFORCEMENT THROUGH COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   Whenever the Board of Health shall certify to the Solicitor any failure to
comply with any such order or notice of vacation, with the request that civil
proceedings for the enforcement thereof be instituted, the Solicitor shall
institute any and all proceedings, either legal or equitable, that may be
appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of such order or notice and the
abatement of the nuisance against which such order or notice was directed; such
suits or proceedings to be brought in the name of the Municipality. 
Proceedings under this section shall not relieve any party defendant from
criminal prosecution or punishment under this Code or any other criminal law or
ordinance in force within the Municipality.
1301.08  CLEANLINESS; HOTELS, MOTELS, LODGING HOUSES, ETC.
   Every owner of, and every agent in charge of, a tenement house, lodging
house, tourist home, tourist cabin, motel or hotel, or part thereof, shall
cause to be kept thoroughly clean all parts of the premises not within the
occupied apartments.  No person shall place filth, urine, or fecal matter in
any place other than provided for the same, or keep filth, urine or fecal
matter in his apartments or upon his premises such length of time as to create
a nuisance, and every tenant shall keep his apartment in clean and sanitary
condition.  The walls of courts and shafts, unless built in a light color brick
or stone, shall be thoroughly whitewashed or painted a light color and shall be
so maintained.  Such whitewash or paint shall be renewed as required by the
Board of Health.
1301.09  PRIVY VAULTS, CESSPOOLS, ETC.
   No person being the owner, occupant, or person in charge of any premises so
situated as to permit of connection with any sanitary sewer, shall maintain or
permit to be maintained on or in connection with such premises any privy vault,
cesspool, septic tank or other repository for human excreta.
1301.10  UNSANITARY VAULTS.
   No person being the owner, lessor, occupant or person in charge of any
premises upon which a privy vault, cesspool or septic tank is located, shall
permit such vault, pool or tank, or any building, fixture or device appurtenant
thereto, to become foul, noisome, filthy, or offensive to neighboring property
owners.
1301.11  REMOVAL OF CONTENTS OF VAULT.
   Whenever any part of the waste in any privy vault or cesspool extends to a
point less than two feet below the surface of the ground adjacent thereto, or
whenever use of any such vault or cesspool is abandoned or where such use or
maintenance is prohibited by ordinance or health order, the owner, lessor,
occupant or person in charge of such premises, shall cause such vault or
cesspool to be emptied of its contents, thoroughly cleaned, and disinfected,
and if abandoned, to be filled with clean earth or mineral matter to the level
of the adjacent ground.  Any failure to comply with these provisions shall be
deemed an unlawful act subject to the penalty herein provided.
1301.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever shall violate the provisions of Chapter
1301 for which no other penalty is provided shall be guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.  Each day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be a
separate offense.

CHAPTER 1309
Flood Damage Reduction
1309.01   General provisions.
1309.02   Definitions.
1309.03   Administration.
1309.04   Use and development standards for flood hazard reduction.
1309.05   Appeals and variances.
1309.06   Enforcement.
 
 
1309.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article  XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of North Baltimore has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and  generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
North Baltimore as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Village of North
Baltimore.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. 
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Wood County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Wood County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective September 2, 2011.
         B.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
         C.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of North Baltimore as required by Section
1309.04 (c).
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village of North Baltimore, 205 North Main
Street, North Baltimore, Ohio 45872.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of North Baltimore, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 11-
14.  Passed 8-2-11.)
1309.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real

   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 2 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of North
Baltimore Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 2, 1982, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Administrator of
the Village of North Baltimore and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of North Baltimore have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
the Village of North Baltimore's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent
the Village of North Baltimore boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village of North Baltimore suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village
of North Baltimore has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1309.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. 
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.

"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of North Baltimore specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1309.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 11-14.  Passed 8-2-

constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1309.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines

      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Any
person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided
by the laws of the Village of North Baltimore. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the Village of North Baltimore from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The Village of North
Baltimore shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with
the penalties stated herein.  (Ord. 11-14.  Passed 8-2-11.)
