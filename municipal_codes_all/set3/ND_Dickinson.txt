The improvement of the municipal street system and any part thereof, including any one or more of the processes of acquisition, opening, widening, grading, graveling, paving, repaving, surfacing with tar, asphalt, bituminous, or other appropriate material, resurfacing, resealing, and repairing of any street, highway, avenue, alley or public place within the City of Dickinson, and the construction and reconstruction of overhead pedestrian bridges, pedestrian tunnels, storm sewers, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, and service connections for water and other utilities, and the installation, operation, and maintenance of street lights and all types of decorative street lighting, including but not restricted to Christmas street lighting decorations.

industrial, and domestic wastes, and all other appurtenances, contrivances, and structures used or useful for a complete water supply and sewerage system.
The improvement of boulevards and other public places by the planting of trees, the construction of grass plots and the sowing of grass seed therein, and the maintenance and preservation of such improvements by the watering of such trees and grass, the cutting of such grass, and the trimming of such trees, or otherwise in any manner which may appear necessary and proper to the governing body of the City of Dickinson.
The acquiring of the necessary land and easements and the construction of the necessary works, within and without the City of Dickinson, for flood protection of properties within the City of Dickinson.
The acquiring or leasing of the necessary property and easements and the construction of parking lots, ramps, garages, and other facilities for motor vehicles. In planning an improvement project of a type specified in any one of the foregoing subsections, the City Commission may include in such plans any and all items of work and materials which in its judgment are necessary or reasonably incidental to the completion of an improvement project of such type. (Ord. No. 1183 § 1.)
Section 2.40.011 Improvement district to be created.
For the purpose of making an improvement project of one of the types specified in section 2.40.010 and defraying the cost thereof by special assessments, the City of Dickinson may create water districts, sewer districts, water and sewer districts, street improvement districts, boulevard improvement districts, flood protection districts, and parking districts, and may extend any such district when necessary. The appropriate special improvement district may be created by resolution. The district shall be designated by a name appropriate to the type of improvement for the making of which it is created, and by a number distinguishing it from other improvement districts. Nothing herein, however, shall prevent the City of Dickinson from making and financing any improvement and levying special assessments therefor under any alternate procedure set forth under Title 40, NDCC. (Ord. No. 1183 § 2.)
Section 2.40.012 Size and form of improvement districts - regulations governing.
Any improvement district created by the City of Dickinson may embrace two or more separate property areas, and may embrace the entire city. Each improvement district shall be of such size and form as to include all properties which in the judgment of the city commission, after consultation with the engineer planning the improvement, will be benefited by the construction of the improvement project which is proposed to be made in or for such district, or by any portion or portions of such project. A single district may be created for an improvement of the type specified in any one of the subsections of section 2.40.010, notwithstanding any lack of uniformity among the types, items, or quantities of work and materials to be used at particular locations throughout the district. The jurisdiction of the City of Dickinson to make, finance, and assess the cost of any improvement project shall not be impaired by any lack of commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose, or character of the improvement, or by the fact that any one or more of the properties included in the district is subsequently determined not to be benefited by the improvement, or by a particular portion thereof, and is not assessed therefor. There may be omitted from a water or sewer district, in the discretion of the City Commission,
properties within the corporate limits which are benefited by the improvement therein but do not abut upon a water or sewer main, without prejudice to the right and power of the municipality subsequently, to assess such properties to the extent and in the manner permitted by law. The City Commission may, by resolution, enlarge an improvement district in which an improvement is proposed or under construction upon receipt of a petition therefor signed by the owners of three-fourths of the area to be added to the district. (Ord. No. 1183 § 3.)
Section 2.40.013 Engineer s report required - Contents.
After a special improvement district has been created, the City Commission, if it deems it necessary to make any of the improvements set out in section 2.40.010 in the manner provided in this chapter, shall direct the city engineer to prepare a report as to the general nature, purpose, and feasibility of the proposed improvement and an estimate of the probable cost of the work.. The engineer s report shall include estimates of the portion of the improvement contemplated each year, the period of years which the improvement will be completed, and the estimated cost of the improvement each year. (Ord. No. 1183 § 4.)
Section 2.40.014 Resolution declaring improvements necessary - Exception for sewer and water improvements - Contents of resolution - Publication of resolution.
After the engineer s report required by section 2.40.013 has been filed and approved, the City Commission, by resolution, shall declare that it is necessary to make the improvements described therein. A resolution shall not be required, however, if the improvement constitutes a water or sewer improvement as described in subsection 2 of section 2.40.010, nor if the governing body determines by resolution that a written petition for the improvement, signed by the owners of a majority of the area of the property included within the district, has been received. The resolution shall refer intelligibly to the engineers report, and shall include a map of the City of Dickinson showing the proposed improvement districts. The resolution shall then be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of the City of Dickinson. (Ord. No. 1183 § 5.)
Section 2.40.015 Protest against resolution of necessity - Meeting to hear protest.
If, within thirty days after the first publication of the resolution declaring the necessity of an improvement project of the type specified in any one of the subsections of section 2.40.010, the owners of any property within the improvement district file written protests describing the property which is the subject of the protest with the city administrator protesting against the adoption of said resolution, the City Commission, at its next meeting after the expiration of the time for filing such protests, shall hear and determine the sufficiency thereof. (Ord. No. 1183 § 6.)
Section 2.40.016 Protest bar to proceeding - Invalid or insufficient protests - Payment of costs - Tax levy.
If the City Commission finds the protests to contain the names of the owners of a majority of the area of the property included within the improvement district, the protests shall be a bar against proceeding further with the improvement project described in the engineer s report. The termination of proceedings, by reason of protest or otherwise, shall not relieve the City of Dickinson of responsibility for payment of costs theretofore incurred; and for payment of such costs the City of Dickinson may, if funds on hand and available for the purpose are insufficient, issue its certificates of indebtedness or warrants, or levy a tax which shall be considered a tax for a portion of the cost of a special improvement project by general taxation within the meaning of section 57-15-10. If the protests are found to be insufficient or invalid, the City Commission may cause the improvements to be made and may contract or otherwise provide in accordance with this title for the construction thereof and the acquisition of the property required in connection therewith and may levy and collect assessments therefor. (Ord. No. 1183 § 7.)
Section 2.40.050 Contracts for improvements.
If the City Commission determines that the improvement should be made, it shall proceed on an annual basis, and consistent with the engineers report, to make the improvements. The City Commission shall also direct the city engineer to prepare, on an annual basis, a report as to the portion of the project to be constructed, together with the estimated cost of the same. (Ord. No. 1183 § 8.)

The plans and specifications shall be approved by a resolution of the City Commission, which resolution may authorize advertising for proposals for the improvements. If the plans and specifications include the establishment of the grade of a street and such grade has not been established previously by ordinance, the resolution approving the plans, specifications, and estimates shall constitute an establishment of the grade. (Ord. No. 1183 § 9.)
Section 2.40.052 Plans, specifications, and estimates filed in office of city administrator.
The plans, specifications, and estimates shall be the property of the City of Dickinson and shall be filed in the office of the city administrator and shall remain on file in his office subject to inspection by anyone interested therein. The City Administrator shall furnish to any person applying therefor copies of the same, and may charge the costs of such copies, as established by the City. (Ord. No. 1183 § 10.)
Section 2.40.053 Contract proposals.
Proposals for the work of making improvements provided for in this chapter must be advertised for by the City Commission in the official newspaper of the city once each week for three consecutive weeks.

No. 1183 § 12.)

The provisions of Sections 40-22-36, 40-22-37, 40-22-39 and 40-22-40, NDCC, together with any amendments thereto, are hereby incorporated by reference. (Ord. No. 1183 § 14.)
Section 2.40.057 Defects and irregularities in improvement proceedings are not fatal.
Defects and irregularities in any proceedings had or to be had under this chapter relating to municipal improvements by the special assessment method, where the proceedings are for a lawful purpose and are unaffected by fraud and do not violate any constitutional limitation or restriction, shall not invalidate such proceedings, and no action shall be commenced or maintained and no defense or counterclaim in any action shall be recognized in the courts of this state founded on any such defects or irregularities in such proceedings, unless commenced within thirty days of the adoption of the resolution of the City Commission awarding the sale of warrants to finance the improvement. (Ord. No. 1183 § 15.)
Section 2.40.100 Assessment of Benefits.

Section 2.70.010 Requirements for Development Approval
All impact fees approved under this chapter shall comply with the following terms and conditions:
If a developer owns at least 51% of the affected properties in a proposed improvement area, the developer may apply to the City for special assessments to be placed upon properties in the proposed improvement area, in order to pay, in part, for improvements to the affected properties.
The City shall require the developer to cover at least 50% of the costs of improvements. The City may assess up to 50% of the cost of improvements to benefited properties to a maximum amount, as set forth in Section 2.70.020
In enacting this Article 2.70, the Board of City Commissioners finds that by requiring the developer to pay for at least 50% of the costs, that person or company will be at considerable risk for the improvements and less likely to abandon the project after construction of improvements.
If the City initiates a street improvement project, proportionate costs of water, sewer, storm water, curb, gutter, and sidewalk will be assessed to benefited properties.
If the City initiates any necessary infrastructure improvements in an area a developer or landowner is not ready to develop, the City will cover the costs of the improvement and assess proportionate impact fees on benefited properties following development.
All developer proposed improvements are subject to approval by the City and must be designed to City standards.
All properties served by City improvements or services must be in the City limits.
All properties eligible to apply for development impact fees must be within city limits or annexed thereto prior to approval of the development impact fee application. No property lying outside of city limits shall be eligible to obtain development impact fees or cost participation by the City.
The Board of City Commissioners finds that it is in the best interests of the City to prioritize in-fill development projects over those that may wish to be annexed to the City. Accordingly, preference in the granting and approval of development impact fees may be given to those properties within city limits as of August 1, 2010.
Application for development impact fees shall not be made prior to approval of a final plat by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Cost share reimbursement by the City shall be made only upon the Citys receipt of actual invoices from the developer. Total cost share reimbursement shall not exceed 50% of the actual costs incurred by the developer for the improvements. Total cost share reimbursement shall not exceed the estimates provided by the developer in the development impact fee application filed with the City.
A developer shall have a period of 12 months from the date of the approval of the application in which to begin construction. In the event construction has not commenced within 12 months of the date of approval of the application, such application and approval shall be null and void, and shall require a new application and approval.

Chapter 3 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS OR ESTABLISHMENTS
Last updated March 2011
Sections:
3.010 Legislative intent and purpose
3.020 Definitions
3.030 Licenses generally
3.040 Location and conditions for operation; license application
3.050 Severability
Section 3.010 Legislative intent and purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to recognize and to provide for the fact that the operation of adult entertainment centers or adult establishments and the operation of associated mechanical amusement devices which depict or display specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas results in increased enforcement problems for the city and additional expense to the city that justifies a higher license fee for these centers, establishments or devices than for other mechanical amusement devices, establishments or centers. This follows because it is not immediately possible to distinguish between constitutionally protected nonobscene depictions or portrayals of explicit sexual conduct, on one hand, from nonconstitutionally protected obscene portrayals of sexual conduct on the other hand. This necessitates greater police vigilance to assure that the lawful business of displaying nonobscene portrayals or depictions of sexual conduct is not used inadvertently or by design as the means of unlawfully displaying or depicting obscenity. In order to recoup some of the costs thus imposed on the city, it is appropriate that there be imposed on the persons who profit from such devices, centers or establishments some of the costs of insuring that the devices, centers or establishments are used only lawfully. For the purposes of promoting the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the city residents as authorized by state law, the state has provided certain powers to the city in furtherance thereof. In addition to the increased enforcement problems for the city and additional expense, it is necessary that the city specify certain zoning areas and establish certain regulations pertaining to licensing adult entertainment centers or adult establishments and associated mechanical amusement devices, delineating the placement of such centers, establishments or devices in certain specified zoning areas and requiring certain information, before licensing such centers, establishments or devices and placement of such businesses.

Section 4.08.060 License Requirements - Limitation on number; issuance generally; renewal
The Board of City Commissioners hereby finds that in order to ensure compliance by all licensees with all applicable federal, states, and city laws, ordinances, and regulations, and in order to adequately police establishments engaged in the retail sale of alcoholic beverages, and in order to promote the public welfare, it is necessary and proper to limit the number of certain classes of licenses, as provided herein, pursuant to the citys police powers and the authority granted by Title 5 of the North Dakota Century Code.
(a) On/Off Sales Licenses
As of December 31, 2012, a total of seventeen on/off sale licenses existed within the city limits of the City of Dickinson. No additional on/off sale licenses shall be granted, until the population of the city reaches an estimated twenty one thousand (21,000) people, at which time the City Commission may, but shall not be required to, grant an additional on/off sale license, as hereinafter provided.
The City Commission may grant an additional on/off sale license for each incremental population increase of three thousand people above 21,000 people, as may be determined in the sole discretion of the City Commission from time to time, based upon annexations, household units, census projections, census results, or other methods of estimated population.
If additional licenses have been granted because of an increase in population, said licenses will be eliminated when the population falls below the population level that authorized the additional license. In addition, if the population of the city falls below twenty one thousand, one on/off sale license shall be eliminated from the number authorized under this section. However, said licenses shall not be eliminated until such time as a license is vacated.
Annexation of Pre-Existing License
Any on/off sale license which is added to the city by virtue of annexation shall automatically increase the number of on/off sale licenses available under subsection (a) of this section Notwithstanding addition of on/off sale licenses added by annexation, the city may nevertheless add additional on/off sale licenses based upon the requisite population increases, as stated in subsection (a) of this section.
Addition of On/Off Sale License  Procedure for Granting.
In the event that the City Commission elects to grant an additional on/off sale license as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the City shall award the additional on/off sale license pursuant to a public bidding process. The City shall proceed as follows:
1) The City shall set a date for the receipt of sealed bids from interested parties, and a date and time for bid opening.
2) The City shall provide notice to the general public of its intent to grant an additional on/off sale license by sealed bids. Such notice shall be published in the official newspaper of the City at least fifteen (15) days prior to the deadline for receipt of bids. Notice shall further be given by such other means as the City Commission or City staff shall deem appropriate. The Board of City Commissioners may, in its sole discretion, establish a minimum bid amount, which shall be made known to any and all potential bidders.
3) Interested parties shall submit an application for an on/off sale license, together with the information required by Dickinson City Code 4.08070, or as may otherwise be required for City staff to determine the partys qualifications for a license. Interested parties shall further submit the non-refundable application fee set by the City. Parties failing to submit the required application, information, and application fee shall have their bids removed from consideration.
4) Interested parties shall further submit to the City a sealed bid for the additional on/off sale license.
5) City staff shall review the application and information submitted by all interested parties. Parties who are determined by City staff to be not qualified for a license shall have their bids removed from consideration.
6) Opening of sealed bids shall be held at the time and date set by the City. Parties shall have the opportunity to improve their written bids pursuant to an auction process.
7) City staff shall submit all final, qualified bids to the City Commission, together with a recommendation from City staff regarding the award of the bid.
8) At its sole discretion, the City Commission may grant the additional on/off sale license to the highest responsible bidder.
9) Upon grant of the on/off sale license from the City Commission, the successful party shall immediately pay the full bid price. If the successful party is unable to immediately pay the full bid price, the City Commission may offer the license to the next highest bidder or, in the Commissions sole discretion, decline to offer the license to any remaining bidder.
10) The City reserves the right to reject any and all bids, to waive any informalities in the bidding process or any bid received, and to accept any bid which, in sole judgment of the City Commission, is in the Citys best interest.
11) The successful bidder shall have a period of one year from the date of granting of the addition on/off sale license in which to open and operate a business pursuant to the on/off sale license. The successful bidder may request, in writing, an extension from the City Administrator of up to 12 months in the event that extraordinary circumstances prevent the successful bidder from opening and operating a business pursuant to the additional on/off sale license within the initial time allotted. The City Administrator shall grant such extension if it is in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare. Additional extensions may be granted in the sole discretion of the Board of City Commissioners upon a showing by the successful bidder of extraordinary circumstances preventing the successful bidder from opening and operating a business pursuant to the on/off sale license within the time allotted, and upon a showing of significant progress toward opening and operating a business pursuant to the on/off sale license. If a business is not opened and operated by the licensee within one year of its granting by the City Commission, or within such additional time as may be granted, in writing, the license shall revert back to the City, without refund or reimbursement to the licensee.
12) The additional on/off sale license shall be non-transferable during the first year of its actual operation and sales.

Any one person may have an interest in no more than two on/off sale licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages, whether such interest is acquired by direct ownership or indirect ownership of the business being conducted or to be conducted at the locations sought to be licensed.
An interest in an on/off sale license acquired by "indirect ownership" shall be deemed to exist whenever a person has any financial interest whatsoever in the business conducted or to be conducted at the location sought to be licensed, regardless of the amount of the financial interest, the percentage ownership of the business, or the corporate form in which the financial interest is held; provided, however, that in the event that an on/off sale license is granted to a publicly traded company, persons holding less than five percent of the total voting shares of such publicly traded company shall be deemed not to have an interest acquired by "indirect ownership".
An interest in an on/off sale license acquired by "indirect ownership" shall further be deemed to exist where, under the totality of the circumstances, in the sole discretion of the Board of City Commissioners, any two on/off sale licenses may be operated in conjunction with one another, due to familial relationships or other business interests held in common among persons holding or applying for a license, or having any interest therein.
This provision applies only to the on/off sale licenses governed by Section 4.08.060(a) of this Code. (Ord. No. 396; Ord. No. 1184, § 8; Ord. No. § 16; Ord. No. 1346 §2.)

Any license provided for in this chapter shall be denied to any applicant who, in the discretion of the board of city commissioners, is a person of questionable character or for any other cause which would, in the opinion of the board, render the applicant or the premises to be licensed, improper or unfit or which would, in the board's opinion, make the granting of the license contrary to the best interests of this city and its citizens.
If a license becomes available, and there is more than one applicant, the City Commission may conduct an auction amongst all qualified applicants, and award the license to the successful bidder at said auction.

(b) Single grave lots shall normally be sold only from single grave lot sections, except as isolated single grave lots may be elsewhere available. In single grave lot sections there can be no choice of location, as these lots must be filled in regular order, nor can any such lots be reserved or sold for future use. (Ord. No. 1006, § 1; Ord. No. 1208, § 6; Ord. No. 1364 § 1.)
Section 9.210 Charges for sites for burial
(a) The charges for sites for the right of burial in all city-owned cemeteries and the charges for opening and closing cremation graves shall be in such amount as determined from
time to time by the board of city commissioners and shall be on file by the city in the city fee schedule.
(b) The charges to open and close graves shall be set by the board of city commissioners and maintained in the City Fee Schedule.

(b) In the event that a burial site is unused for more than 80 years after its sale, resale and/or transfer, title to the burial space shall revert to the city as provided in section 9.235.
(c) No "right of burial" will be issued until a lot is fully paid for, and if interment is permitted before such time, the city retains the right to refuse future interments or any improvements until the balance due on the lot is fully paid, and in case of persistent default, to remove any body already interred to the single grave section.
(d) A "right of burial" from the city and its record on the books of the city is the only evidence of title recognized by the city; therefore, no lot shall be subdivided or transferred by deed or otherwise; and in the event of any subdivision or transfer or use of the property contrary to any of the provisions of the right of burial, the whole thereof shall revert to the city. (Ord. No. 1006, § 1; Ord. No. 1273 § 11; Ord No. 1371 §1)

The resolution shall notify the owner that the owner must, within 60 days after service
of the resolution upon the owner, express an interest in retaining the unused cemetery lot.
(2) A copy of the resolution shall be served upon the owner in the same manner as personal service of process in a civil action. If the owner is unknown or cannot be found, the City shall publish its resolution once a week for three consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of the county where the cemetery is located, and shall further mail a copy of the resolution to the owner at the last known address of the owner, if known.
(3) If within 60 days after personal service or after publication of the Citys resolution is completed, the owner or person with a legal interest in the cemetery lot or burial space fails to express an interest in retaining the unused cemetery lot or burial space, the owners rights therein are terminated and title to that persons plot reverts to the City. (Ord No. 1371 §1)
Section 9.240 Recording change of ownership
On the death of an owner or part-owner of a site, the heirs or designees of the deceased, if required, shall file with the city satisfactory proof of their heirship for the purpose of establishing the new ownership on the books of the city. (Ord. No. 1006, § 1; Ord. No. 1364 § 1.)

(Ord. No. 406, § 3.)
Section 10.04.030 Same--Exclusiveness
The right to use and occupy such streets, alleys, public ways and places for the purposes herein set forth shall not be exclusive and the city reserves the right to grant a similar use of such streets, alleys, public ways and places to any other person or persons at any time during the period of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. No. 406, § 4.)
Section 10.04.040 Subjection of franchised company to police power of city
Any company shall at all times during the life of its franchise be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power by the city and to such reasonable regulations as the city shall hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide. (Ord. No. 406, § 5.)
Section 10.04.050 Liability insurance required
Any company obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this chapter shall indemnity and save the city and its agents and employees harmless from any and all claims for personal injuries or property damages and any other claims, costs including attorneys' fees, expense of investigation and litigation of claims and suits thereon which may arise from the installation, operation or maintenance of its system within the city. For this purpose each company shall carry and at all times maintain on file with the city auditor and at all times keep in force a public liability policy of insurance insuring the company and the city against any and all such liability for not less than fifty thousand dollars property damage, one hundred thousand dollars for any one person for personal injury or death, and three hundred thousand dollars for any one accident resulting in personal injury or death. Such policy or policies of insurance or certificates thereof, by a company licensed to do business in the state, shall be filed with the city prior to the final approval of any franchise granted hereunder. Any company, upon receipt of due notice in writing from the city, shall defend at its own expense any action or proceeding against the city in which it is claimed that injury or damages arose from the company's activities in the operation of its community antenna system. The city shall notify the company's representatives within the city within thirty days after the presentation of any claim or demand, either by suit or otherwise, made against the city on account of any negligence as aforesaid on the part of the company. (Ord. No. 406, § 6.)
Section 10.04.060 Conditions upon street occupancy
(a) Use Generally. All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected or constructed by the company within the city shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with any other proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and places and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of such streets, alleys or other public ways and places.
(b) Restoration. In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, the company shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the city engineer, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway or surface of any street or alley disturbed in as good condition as before the work was commenced and shall maintain the restoration in an approved condition for a period of at least one year thereafter.
(c) Relocation. In the event that at any time during the period of a franchise the city shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade of any street, alley or other public way, the company, upon reasonable notice by the city, shall remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other telephone and television fixtures at its own expense.
(d) Placement of Fixtures. The company shall not place poles or other fixtures where the same will interfere with any gas, electric or telephone fixtures, water hydrant or main; and all such poles or other fixtures placed in any street shall be placed at the outer edge of the sidewalk and inside the curb line; and those placed in alleys shall be placed close to the line of the lot abutting on such alley and then in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on such streets, alleys and public ways; provided, however, that the company will place all wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment underground when other telephone, telegraph or other electrical utilities services are so located in such area
unless the company is specifically, by action of the commission, permitted to do otherwise where extreme hardship would result or where an underground installation is not workable. It is the intention of this section to require that any company granted a franchise hereunder use a portion of other utility poles already erected for the development of the company's aboveground distribution system, and no company shall be permitted to erect its own poles, except where existing utility poles are inadequate to handle the additional load and where the placing of such additional poles is specifically authorized by the commission or its duly authorized representatives.
(e) Temporary Removal of Wire for Building Moving. The company shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings.

The company shall be given at least forty-eight hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
(f) Tree Trimming. The company shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires, cables, fixtures and equipment of the company; all such trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction of the city and at the expense of the company. (Ord. No. 406, § 10.)
For state law as to authority of city to regulate the use, etc., of streets, see NDCC, § 40-05-01(8).
As to streets and sidewalks generally, see Ch. 30 of this Code.
Section 10.04.070 Warranting by city of authority to use streets
It is understood that there may be within the city various streets, alleys and other public ways which the city does not have the unqualified right to authorize any company to use because of reservations in favor of the dedicators or because of other legal impediments. Therefore, in granting any franchise pursuant to this chapter, the city does not warrant or represent as to any particular street or portion thereof that it has the right to authorize any company to install or maintain portions of its systems therein, and in each case the burden and responsibility for making such determination in advance of the installation shall be upon the company. (Ord. No. 406, § 22.)
Section 10.04.080 Approval of transfer of system
The company shall not sell or transfer its plant or system or any portion thereof to any person nor transfer any right under any franchise except by operation of law to any person without prior approval of the commission.

The city shall be entitled to inspection of any records bearing on the number of subscribers for service with the company and to require reasonable documentation of such information by the company when the annual payment, provided in section 8-16, is tendered. (Ord. No. 406, § 17.)

The company shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the company to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under its franchise and to assure an uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the laws of the state and shall be subject to approval by the commission and any other duly authorized public agency or board. (Ord. No. 406, § 9.)
Section 10.04.110 Penalty
Any violation by any company, its lessee or successor under any franchise granted pursuant hereto or the failure to promptly perform any of the provisions of such franchise shall be cause for the forfeiture of such franchise and all rights thereunder to the city after reasonable written notice to such company and continuation thereafter of such violation, failure or default.

Such commitment shall be in the minimum amount of ten thousand dollars and shall be made in favor of the city. The amount of such commitment shall be adjusted semiannually during the term of the franchise and such adjustments shall be subject to approval by the city commission so as to provide a total commitment of the applicant corporation equal to at least one thousand dollars for each mile of cable constructed by the company within the city. Such commitment must guarantee that the company has assets over and above all debts and liabilities equal to at least twice the amount of the commitment herein required from time to time.

No precise form of an extension policy is specified herein but any applicant shall agree to furnish any information that may be requested from time to time by the city commission in clarification of the company's extension policy. Once a company is granted a franchise under this chapter, following approval of its extension policy as submitted and filed, it shall not make or refuse to make any extension thereunder except as provided by such extension policy or as may otherwise be permitted by this chapter or subsequent enactments of the commission. The extension policy, and any amendments thereto, which in turn must be first approved by the commission before becoming effective, shall at all times be on file at the office of the city auditor and be available to inspection by the public.

Such payment shall be made annually at the end of the fiscal year of the company and shall be computed on the total number of subscribers doing business with the company at any time during the fiscal year just concluded.

Any franchise and rights granted thereunder shall take effect and be in full force from and after final approval thereof by the commission, as specifically provided in section 10.08.010, and upon filing of a written acceptance of such franchise by the company with the city auditor, and such franchise shall continue in full force and effect for a term of fifteen years after such date; provided, that if a written acceptance is not filed within sixty days after such final approval of the franchise by the commission or if the system authorized thereunder is not completely constructed within six months after the time of such acceptance, unless such construction is prevented by strike, insurrection, an act of God or other cause beyond the control of the applicant, the provisions of such franchise shall then become automatically null and void, unless such delay in construction is reasonably explained to the city commission and the commission, in its sole discretion, elects to grant an extension of time in which to complete such construction work. In the event that any system contemplated hereunder requires approval by the Federal
Communications Commission or any other state or federal board or agency prior to the commencement of construction, the six month period allowed herein for construction to be completed shall not begin until after such federal or state approval is obtained, although application therefor must be made no later than sixty days after the final approval of the franchise by the city commission.

The city in its use and maintenance of such wires and fixtures shall at all times comply with the rules and regulations of the company so that there may be a minimum danger of contact or conflict between the wires and fixtures of the company and the wires and fixtures used by the city. The city shall be solely responsible for all damage to persons or property arising out of the construction or maintenance of such wires and fixtures authorized by this section and shall save the company harmless from all claims and demands whatsoever arising out of the attachment, maintenance, change or removal of such wires and fixtures to the poles of the company. In case of rearrangement of the company plant or removal of poles or fixtures, the city shall save the company harmless from any damage to persons or property arising out of the removal or construction of the wires or other fixtures belonging to the city.
(c) Supervision and Inspection. The city shall have the right to supervise all construction or installation work performed subject to the provisions of this chapter and to make such inspections as it shall find necessary to insure compliance with governing laws, ordinances and resolutions.

(Ord. No. 866, § 1.)
Section 23.16.020 Specifications
All traffic-control signs, signals and devices shall conform to the specifications approved by the state highway commissioner pursuant to North Dakota Century Code, section 39-13-06. All signs and signals required hereunder for a particular purpose shall, so far as practicable, be uniform as to type and location throughout the city. All traffic-control devices so erected and not inconsistent with the provisions of state law or this article shall be official traffic-control devices. (Ord. No. 866, § 1.)
Section 23.16.030 Traffic-control signal legend
The provisions of North Dakota Century Code, section 39-10-05, and all subsequent amendments, shall be and are hereby incorporated by reference in this section.
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word or legend, and such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
(a) Green Indication.
(1) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersections or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signals are exhibited.
Page 245 of 878
(2) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
(3) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in section 23.16.050, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
(b) Steady Yellow Indication.
(1) Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
(2) Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in section 23.16.050 are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
(c) Steady Red Indication.
(1) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown, except as provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(2) Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by paragraph (1) of this subsection. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
(3) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in section 23.16.050, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable, except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, or, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
(2) Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.
(b) This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in section 23.32.060. (Ord. No. 866, § 1.)

(b) No provision of this chapter for which traffic-control devices are required shall be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged violation an official device is not in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a state statute does not state the devices are required, such statute shall be effective even though no devices are erected or in place.
(c) Whenever official traffic-control devices are placed in positions approximately conforming to the requirements of this chapter, such devices shall be presumed to have been so placed by the official act or direction of lawful authority, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.
(d) Any official traffic-control device placed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and purporting to conform to the lawful requirements pertaining to services shall be presumed to comply with the requirement of this chapter, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.

Section 23.56.160 Parking privileges for physically handicapped; certificate; revocation of privilege
The provisions of NDCC section 39-01-15, and all subsequent amendments, are hereby incorporated by reference in this section.
(a) Any mobility impaired person who displays prominently upon an automobile parked by that person or under that person's direction and for the person's use, the
Page 295 of 878
distinguishing certificate specified in subsection (c) is entitled to courtesy in the parking of the automobile. Provided, however, that any municipality may, by ordinance, prohibit parking on any street or highway for the purpose of creating a fire lane, or to provide for the accommodation of heavy traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours, and the privileges extended to such impaired persons do not apply on streets or highways where and during such times as parking is prohibited.
(b) A mobility impaired person as used in this section includes any person who has lost the use of one or both legs; requires personal assistance or the use of crutches, a wheelchair, or a walker to walk two hundred feet (60.96 meters) without rest; is restricted by cardiac, pulmonary, or vascular disease from walking two hundred feet (60.96 meters) without rest; has a forced expiratory volume of less than one liter for one second or an arterial oxygen tension of less than sixty millimeters of mercury of room air while at rest and is classified III or IV by standards for cardiac disease set by the American Heart Association; or has an orthopedic, neurologic, or other medical condition that makes it impossible for the person to walk two hundred feet (60.96 meters) without assistance or rest.
(c) The registrar of motor vehicles may issue, for a fee of three dollars per year or part of a year, a special identifying certificate to any mobility impaired applicant upon submission by the applicant of a completed application and a written statement issued by a qualified physician to the registrar that the applicant is a mobility impaired person within the criteria of subsection (b). The application must include the information required by the registrar. The physician's statement must describe how the impairment limits the applicant's mobility and daily life functions of the applicant. The certificate is valid for a period, not to exceed three years, as determined by the registrar. A physician who provides a false statement that a person is mobility impaired for the purpose of that person obtaining a certificate under this subsection is guilty of an infraction for which a minimum fine of one hundred dollars must be imposed. A certificate issued under this subsection must be at least five and one-half inches (13.97 centimeters) in height and weight and one-half inches (21.59 centimeters) in width and must bear, in blue on white, the internationally accepted symbol of access for the mobility impaired. The certificate must bear the expiration date and registration number assigned by the registrar. The registrar shall adopt rules governing the issuance of the certificate. A temporary certificate, valid for an initial period not to exceed three months, may be issued by the registrar for a fee of three dollars upon application supported by a physician's statement. The temporary certificate may be extended an additional period, not to exceed three months, upon application supported by a physician's statement that the extension is warranted. The registrar shall determine the form and size of the temporary certificate.
(d) A certificate issued under this section must be prominently displayed on the left-hand dashboard of the motor vehicle whenever the vehicle is occupying a space reserved for the mobility impaired and is being used by a mobility impaired person or another person for the purposes of transporting the mobility impaired person. No part of the certificate may be obscured. A fee of five dollars may be imposed for a violation of this subsection.
Page 296 of 878
(e) If a law enforcement officer finds that the certificate is being improperly used, the officer may report to the registrar of motor vehicles any such violation and the registrar may, in the registrar's discretion, remove the privilege. Any person who is not mobility impaired and who exercises the privileges granted a mobility impaired person under subsection (a) is guilty of an infraction for which a fine of one hundred dollars must be imposed.
(f) Whenever any public or private agency or authority designates parking spaces for use by motor vehicles operated by mobility impaired persons, those reserved spaces shall be indicated by blue paint on the curb or edge of the paved portion of the street or parking lot adjacent to the space. In addition to blue paint, the spaces reserved must also be indicated by official signs approved by the commissioner bearing the internationally accepted symbol of access for the mobility impaired which indicate, through the use of arrows, the total width of the reserved area. The sign must indicate that unauthorized use of the space is a nonmoving violation for which a fine one hundred dollars must be imposed. For particular events, a public or private agency may reserve additional parking spaces for use by motor vehicles operated by mobility impaired persons. In that case, the temporarily reserved spaces must be indicated by signs or other suitable means. A sign indicating that a space is reserved for the mobility impaired and blue paint on the curb or edge of the paved portion of the street or parking lot adjacent to the space, unless the space is a temporary mobility impaired parking space is sufficient basis for the enforcement of this section. A law enforcement officer may enforce this section in any parking lot or parking facility whether publicly or privately owned.
(g) A person may not stop, stand, or park any vehicle in any designated parking space that is reserved for the mobility impaired unless the vehicle displays a mobility impaired identification certificate issued by the registrar of motor vehicles to a mobility impaired person. A mobility impaired person may not permit the use of a certificate issued under this section by a person who is not mobility impaired when that use is not in connection with the transport of the mobility impaired person. The registered owner of a vehicle may not allow that vehicle to be used in a manner that violates this subsection. Proof of intent is not required to prove a registered owner's violation of this subsection. The registered owner, however, may be excused from violation if the owner provides the citing authority with the name and address of the person operating the vehicle at the time of the violation. A vehicle may temporarily use a space reserved for mobility impaired persons without a mobility impaired certificate for the purpose of loading and unloading mobility impaired persons. A violation of this subsection is a nonmoving violation for which a fee of one hundred dollars must be imposed.
(h) Any motor vehicle licensed in another state which displays a special authorized vehicle designation issued by the licensing authority of that state for vehicles used in the transportation of mobility impaired persons must be accorded the same privilege provided in this section for similar vehicles licensed in this state if the laws of the other state provide the same privileges to North Dakota motor vehicles displaying the special identifying certificate authorized in this section.

Section 23.76.010 Persons under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any other drugs or substances not to operate vehicle--Penalty
The provisions of the North Dakota Century Code, section 39-08-01, and all subsequent amendments thereto, shall be and are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference herein.
(a) A person may not drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle upon a highway or upon public or private areas to which the public has a right of access for vehicular use in this city if any of the following apply:
(1) That person has an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight at the time of the performance of a chemical test within two hours after the driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle.
(2) That person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
(3) That person is under the influence of any drug or substance or combination of drugs or substances to a degree which renders that person incapable of safely driving.
(4) That person is under the combined influence of alcohol and any other drugs or substances to a degree which renders that person incapable of safely driving.
(5) That individual refuses to submit to any of the following:
(a) A chemical test, or tests, of the individuals blood, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individuals blood, breath, or urine,
Page 312 of 878
at the direction of a law enforcement officer under NDCC section 39-06.2-10.2 if the individual is driving or is in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle; or
(b) A chemical test, or tests, of the individuals blood, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individuals blood, breath, or urine, at the direction of a law enforcement officer under NDCC section 39-20-01
(6) Subdivision (5) does not apply to an individual unless the individual has been advised of the consequences of refusing a chemical test consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of North Dakota.
The fact that any person charged with violating this section is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or other drugs or substances is not a defense against any charge for violating this section. It is an affirmative defense that a drug was used only as directed or cautioned by a practitioner who legally prescribed or dispensed the drug to that person. If the individual violated subsections 1, 2, 3 or 4 of this subsection and subdivision 5 of this subsection and the violations arose from the same incident, for the purposes of suspension or revocation of an operators license, the violations are deemed a single violation and the court shall forward to the department of transportation only the conviction for driving under the influence or actual physical control.
(b) An individual who operates a motor vehicle on a highway or on public or private areas to which the public has a right of access for vehicular use in this state who refuses to submit to a chemical test, or tests, required under NDCC 39-06.2-10.2, or 39-20-01, is guilty of an offense under this section.
(c) An individual violating this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor for the first or second offense in a seven-year period. The minimum penalty for violating this section is as provided in subsection (e) hereof. The court shall take judicial notice of the fact that an offense would be a subsequent offense if indicated by the records of the Highway Department Commissioner or make a subsequent offense finding based on other evidence.
(d) Upon conviction of a second or subsequent offense within seven years under this section, the court may order the motor vehicle number plates of all of the motor vehicles owned and operated by the offender at the time of the offense to be destroyed by the office of the police officer that made the arrest. The offender shall deliver the number plates to the court without delay at a time certain as ordered by the court following the conviction. The court shall deliver the number plates to the office and notify the Department of Transportation of the order. An offender who does not provide the number plates to the court at the appropriate time is subject to revocation of probation. The court may make an exception to this subsection, on an individual basis, to avoid undue hardship to an individual who is completely dependent upon the motor vehicle for the necessities of life, including a family member of the convicted individual and a co-owner of the motor vehicle, or if the offender is participating in the twenty-four seven sobriety program.
Page 313 of 878
(e) A person convicted of violating this section, must be sentenced in accordance with this subsection:
(1) For a first offense, the sentence must include both a fine of at least five hundred dollars ($500) and an order for addiction evaluation by an appropriate licensed addiction treatment program.
(2) In addition, for a first offense when the convicted person has an alcohol concentration of at least sixteen one-hundredths of one percent by weight, the offense is an aggravated first offense and the sentence must include a fine of at least seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) and at least two (2) days imprisonment.
(3) For a second offense within seven (7) years, the sentence must include at least ten (10) days imprisonment of which forty-eight hours must be served consecutively a fine of at least one thousand five hundred ($1,500) dollars; an order for addiction evaluation by an appropriate licensed addiction treatment program; and at least twelve (12) months participation in the twenty-four seven sobriety program described in NDCC Chapter 54-12 as a mandatory condition of probation.
(4) The execution or imposition of sentence under this section may not be deferred under subsection 4 of North Dakota Century Code section 12.1-32-02 for an offense for an offense subject to this section.
(5) If the offense is subject to this Section 23.76.010, the court may not suspend a sentence, but may convert each day of a term of imprisonment to ten hours of community service for an offense subject to subsection (e)(1). The court may require the defendant to complete alcohol and substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation under the direction of the drug court program as a condition of probation in accordance with rules adopted by the supreme court. If the district court finds that a defendant has failed to undergo an evaluation or complete treatment or has violated any condition of probation, the court shall revoke the defendant's probation and shall sentence the defendant in accordance with this section.
(6) For purposes of this Section, conviction of an offense under a law or ordinance of another state which is equivalent to this Section shall be considered a prior offense if such offense was committed within the time limitations specified in this Section.
(7) If the penalty mandated by this Section includes imprisonment upon conviction of a violation of this section or equivalent ordinance, and if an addiction evaluation has indicated that the defendant needs treatment, the court may order the defendant to undergo treatment at an appropriate licensed addiction treatment program under NDCC 12.1-32-02(g)(1) and the time spent by the defendant in the treatment must be credited as a portion of a sentence of imprisonment or placement under this Section. A court may not order the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to be responsible for the costs of treatment in a private treatment facility.
(8) As used in this Section, the term imprisonment includes house arrest. As a condition of house arrest, a defendant may not consume alcoholic
Page 314 of 878
beverages. The house arrest must include a program of electronic home detention and the defendant shall participate in the twenty-four seven sobriety program. The defendant shall defray all costs associated with the electronic home detention. For an offense under subsection (e)(3) of this Section, no more than ninety percent of the sentence may be house arrest.
(f) As used in this Article, participation in the twenty-four seven sobriety program under NDCC Chapter 54-12 means compliance with NDCC sections 54-12-27 through 54-12-31, and requires sobriety breath testing twice per day seven days per week or electronic alcohol monitoring, urine testing, or drug patch testing. The offender is responsible for all twenty-four seven sobriety program fees and the court may not waive the fees. For purposes of this section, the twenty-four seven sobriety program is a condition of probation and a court may not order participation in the program as part of the sentence. If an individual ordered to participate in the twenty-four seven program is not a resident of this state, that individual shall enroll in a twenty-four seven program or an alcohol compliance program if available in that individuals state of residence and shall file proof of such enrollment.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the municipal court or municipal judge has no jurisdiction to hear, try and determine an offense which could be a violation of North Dakota Century Code, section 39-08-01, or equivalent ordinance, if the individual charged with the offense has twice previously been convicted of a violation of North Dakota Century Code, section 39-08-01, or equivalent ordinance, within the seven (7) years preceding the commission of the offense charged or if the individual charged with the offense has three times previously been convicted of a violation of section 39-08-01 or equivalent ordinance within the fifteen years preceding the commission of the offense charged. If such an offense is charged in the municipal court and the municipal judge has notice of a violation section 39-08-01, or equivalent ordinance, twice within the seven (7) years or three times within the fifteen years, preceding the commission of the offense charged, municipal judge shall dismiss the charge, without prejudice and direct that the charge be filed against the individual in the county court.
(h) Criminal Record  Seal  Exception: The Court shall seal an individuals criminal record under sections 12.1-32-07.1 and 12.1-32-07.2 if the individual:
(1) Has plead guilty or nolo contendere to, or has been found guilty of a violation under section 23.76.010 or 39-08-01; and
(2) Has not plead guilty or nolo contender to, or has not been found guilty of a subsequent violation of section 23.76.010, or any other criminal offense, within seven years of the first violation under 23.76.010 or 39-08-01.
(3) This section does not apply to an individual licenses as a commercial driver under NDCC Section 39-06.2-10 or to a prosecutors access to a prior offense for the purposes of enhancement under section (e)(3) above.

Page 329 of 878

(C) Deny the application.
An application for a stay or temporary certificate under this subparagraph must be accompanied by a certified copy of the appellant's driving record, for the furnishing of which the licensing authority may charge a fee of two dollars. Any order granting a stay or a temporary certificate must be forwarded forthwith by the clerk of court to the licensing authority, which shall issue a temporary certificate in accordance with the order in the manner provided by law. A court may not make a determination on an application under this subparagraph without notice to the appropriate prosecuting attorney. A person who violates or exceeds the restrictions contained in any temporary restricted driving certificate issued pursuant to this subparagraph is guilty of a traffic violation and must be assessed a fee of twenty dollars.
(3) If a person charged is found not to have committed the violation by the appellate court, the clerk of court shall report that fact to the licensing authority immediately. If an appeal under this subsection is from a violation of a city ordinance, the city attorney for the city wherein the alleged violation occurred shall prosecute the appeal. In all other cases, the appropriate state's attorney shall prosecute the appeal.
(f) The city must prove the commission of a charged violation at the hearing or appeal under this section by a fair preponderance of the evidence.

Failure to appear at the time designated, after signing a promise to appear, without paying the statutory fee or posting and forfeiting bond shall be an offense. Failure to appear without just cause at the hearing shall also be deemed an admission of commission of the violation charged. (Ord. No. 866, § 1.)

Section 25.04.01 Definitions.
Any word not specifically defined in this Chapter, but which is defined in Title 12.1 of the North Dakota Century Code, shall have the meaning set forth in the said Title 12.1. (Ord. No. 1191, § 1.)
Section 25.04.02000 Division 25.04.02 Offenses of General Applicability
Section 25.04.02010 Criminal attempt
(a) A person is guilty of criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he intentionally engages in conduct which, in fact, constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the offense. A "substantial step" is any conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's intent to complete the commission of the offense. Factual or legal impossibility of committing the offense is not a defense, if it could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.
(b) A person who engages in conduct intending to aid another to commit an offense is guilty of criminal attempt if the conduct would establish his complicity as an accomplice under North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-03-01, were the offense committed by the other person, even if the other is not guilty of committing or attempting the offense, for example, because he has a defense of justification or entrapment.
(c) Criminal attempt is an offense if the crime attempted is an offense; except, that whenever it is established by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing that the conduct constituting the attempt did not come dangerously close to commission of the offense, an attempt to commit an offense shall be punished as an infraction. Criminal attempt to
Page 353 of 878
commit an infraction is an infraction. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-06-01.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.04.02020 Criminal conspiracy
(a) A person commits conspiracy if he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause conduct which, in fact, constitutes an offense or offenses proscribed by the ordinances of the city, and any one or more of such persons does an overt act to effect an objective of the conspiracy. The agreement or the overt act must occur within the city. The agreement need not be explicit, but may be implicit in the fact of collaboration or existence of other circumstances.
(b) If a person knows or could expect that one with whom he agrees has agreed or will agree with another to effect the same objective, he shall be deemed to have agreed with the other, whether or not he knows the other's identity.
(c) A conspiracy shall be deemed to continue until its objectives are accomplished, frustrated or abandoned. "Objectives" includes escape from the scene of the crime, distribution of booty and measures, other than silence, for concealing the crime or obstructing justice in relation to it. A conspiracy shall be deemed abandoned if no overt act to effect its objectives has been committed by any conspirator during the applicable period of limitations.
(d) It is no defense to a prosecution under this section that the person with whom such person is alleged to have conspired has been acquitted, has not been prosecuted or convicted, has been convicted of a different offense, if immune from prosecution, or is otherwise not subject to justice.
(e) Accomplice liability for offenses committed in furtherance of the conspiracy is to be determined as provided in North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-03-01.
(f) Conspiracy shall be subject to the penalties provided for attempt in subsection 3 of section 25.04.02.010. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-06-04.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.04.04000 Division 25.04.04 Integrity and Effectiveness of Government Operation
Section 25.04.04010 Aiding consummation of crime
A person is guilty of the offense of aiding consummation of an offense against the ordinances of the city if he intentionally aids another to secrete, disguise or convert the proceeds of the offense against the ordinances or otherwise profits from the offense. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-08-04.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.04.04020 Public servants permitting escape
A public servant concerned in official detention, as defined by North Dakota Century Code, § 12.1-08-06(3), pursuant to process issued by a court, judge or magistrate is guilty of an offense against the ordinances of the city if he negligently permits an escape. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-08-07.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Page 354 of 878
Section 25.04.04030 Criminal contempt
(a) The municipal court has power to punish for contempt of its authority only for the following offenses:
(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;
(2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions; or
(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule or command; or
(4) As otherwise provided in 40-18-14, NDCC.
(b) Except as otherwise provided, a criminal contempt proceeding under this section shall be deemed a prosecution for an offense for the purposes of North Dakota Century Code, chapters 12.1-01 through 12.1-05, North Dakota Century Code, chapter 12.1-32, and article 25.20 of this chapter.
(c) A criminal contempt proceeding under this section is not a bar to subsequent prosecution for a specific offense if the court certifies in the judgment of conviction of criminal contempt, or the order terminating the proceeding without acquittal of dismissal, that a summary criminal contempt proceeding was necessary to prevent repetition of misbehavior disruptive of an ongoing proceeding and the subsequent prosecution as a specific offense is warranted. In a subsequent prosecution, the defendant shall receive credit for all time spent in custody and any fine paid by him pursuant to the criminal contempt proceeding.
(d) This section shall not be construed to deprive a court of its power, by civil contempt proceedings, to compel compliance with its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree or command or to compensate a complainant for losses sustained by reason of disobedience or resistance thereto, in accordance with the prevailing usages of law and equity, including the power of detention. (Ord. No. 867, § 1; Ord. No. 1157 § 5.)
Section 25.04.04040 Hindering proceedings by disorderly conduct
A person is guilty of a class B misdemeanor if he recklessly hinders an official city proceeding by noise or violent or tumultuous behavior or disturbance.
Comment: Intentional hinderings by disorderly conduct must be prosecuted in state court since the punishment authorized is higher than that authorized for municipal courts. However, the conduct might also fall within the scope of criminal contempt under section 25.04.04.030.
The proceedings intended to be covered under this offense are official proceedings as defined in North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-01-04(23), involving agencies or branches of the municipal government. (Ord. No. 867, § 1; Ord. No. 1645, § 1)
Section 25.04.04050 Impersonating official
(a) A person is guilty of an offense if he falsely pretends to be a public servant of the city and acts as if to exercise the authority of such public servant.
(b) It is no defense to prosecution under this section that the pretended capacity did not exist or the pretended authority could not legally or otherwise have been exercised or conferred. If the offender "obtains a thing of value" as a result of his pretension, he is guilty of the greater offense prohibited by North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-13-04(1) (b) which is classified as a class A misdemeanor and thus must be prosecuted in
Page 355 of 878
state court. It is also the intention of this section to cover only impersonation of city officials rather than state officials. (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.04.04060 Refusing to halt
Any person, other than the driver of a motor vehicle under section 23.12.050, who willfully fails or refuses to stop or who otherwise flees or attempts to elude, in any manner, a pursuing peace officer, when given a visual or audible signal to stop, is guilty of a class B misdemeanor. A signal to stop complies with this section if the signal is perceptible to the person and:
1. If given from a vehicle, the signal is given by hand, voice, emergency light, or siren, and the vehicle is appropriately marked showing it to be an official law enforcement vehicle; or
2. If not given from a vehicle, the signal is given by hand, voice, emergency light, or siren, and the officer is in uniform or prominently displays the officer's badge of office. (Ord. No. 1590, § 12.)
Section 25.04.06000 Division 25.04.06 Civil Rights
Section 25.04.06010 Discrimination in public places
A person is guilty of offense class B misdemeanor if, whether or not acting under color of law, he, by force or threat of force, or by economic coercion, intentionally:
(a) Injures, intimidates or interferes with another because of his sex, race, color, religion or national origin and because he is or has been exercising or attempting to exercise his right to full and equal enjoyment of any facility open to the public.

Owners, operators, managers, employers, or other persons who own or control a public place or place of employment may seek to rebut the presumption that twenty feet [6.10 meters] is a reasonable minimum distance by making application to the director of the local health department or district in which the public place or place of employment is located. The presumption will be rebutted if the applicant can show by clear and convincing evidence that, given the unique circumstances presented by the location of entrances, exits, windows that open, ventilation intakes, or other factors, smoke will not infiltrate or reach the entrances, exits, open windows, or ventilation intakes or enter into such public place or place of employment and, therefore, the public health and safety will be adequately protected by a lesser distance.
3. The following areas are exempt from subsections 1 and 2:
a. Private residences, except those residences used as a child care, adult day care, or health care facility subject to licensure by the department of human services.

An employee who works in a setting where an employer allows smoking does not waive or surrender any legal rights the employee may have against the employer or any other party. Violations of this subsection shall be a class B misdemeanor.
6. This section may not be interpreted or construed to permit smoking where it is otherwise restricted by other applicable laws.
7. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an owner, operator, manager or other person in control of an establishment, facility, or outdoor area may declare that entire establishment, facility, or outdoor area as a nonsmoking place. (Ord. 1495 § 1)

(Ord. 1495 § 1)
Section 25.06.070 Penalties  Smoking Restrictions

Article 25.08 Offenses Against Persons
Sections:
25.08.010 Simple assault
25.08.015 Domestic Violence
25.08.020 Harassment.
Section 25.08.010 Simple assault
(a) A person is guilty of an offense if that person:
(1) Willfully causes bodily injury to another human being; or
(2) Negligently causes bodily injury to another human being
by means of a firearm, destructive device or other weapon, the use of which against a human being is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury.
(b) Consent to the conduct causing bodily injury by all persons injured by the conduct is a defense if:
(1) Neither the injury inflicted nor the injury threatened is such as to jeopardize life or seriously impair health;
(2) The conduct and the injury are reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a lawful athletic contest or competitive sport; or
(3) The conduct and the injury are reasonably foreseeable hazards of an occupation or profession or of medical or scientific experimentation conducted by recognized methods and the persons subjected to such conduct or injury, having been made aware of the risks involved, consent to the performance of the conduct or the infliction of the injury.
(c) Assent does not constitute consent, within the meaning of this section, if:
(1) It is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense and such incompetence is manifest or known to the actor;
(2) It is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect, or intoxication, is manifestly unable or known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense; or
(3) It is induced by force, duress or deception.
(d) Violation of this Section shall constitute a class B misdemeanor.
Comment: This section parallels the simple assault offense in North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-01, and the consent provisions in North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-08. It essentially follows lay usage in covering what was under common law more technically a battery. Common law assault is now covered more descriptively as terrorizing, North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-04; menacing, North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-05; criminal coercion, North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-06; or harassment, North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-07.
More serious assault (battery) is covered by state law under aggravated assault, North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-02 or, as simple assault upon a peace officer or correctional institution employee acting in an official capacity, as a class C felony under
Page 366 of 878
North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-17-01. (Ord. No. 867, § 1.) Second and subsequent offenses shall be considered a Class A misdemeanor and governed by state law when the victim is an actor's family or household member as defined in subsection 4 of N.D.C.C. § 14-07.1-01 and the actor has a prior conviction for simple assault under this section or an assault offense under section 12.1-17-01.1 or 12.1-17-02 involving the commission of domestic violence as defined in subsection 2 of section 14-07.1-01.

The court may not order the offender to attend anger management classes or individual counseling unless a domestic violence offender treatment program is not reasonably available to the defendant and the court makes findings for the record explaining why an order to complete a domestic violence offender treatment program would be inappropriate (Ord. No. 1680, § 2)
Section 25.08.020 Harassment.

For prosecutions of criminal mischief under section 25.12.02.010 or tampering with or damaging a public service under section 25.12.02.020:

Section 25.12.04000 Division 25.12.04 Theft and Related Offenses
Section 25.12.04010 Consolidated theft offenses
(a) Conduct denominated theft in sections 25.12.04.020 to 25.12.04.040 constitutes a single offense designed to include the separate offenses heretofore known as larceny, stealing, purloining, embezzlement, obtaining money or property by false pretenses, extortion, blackmail, fraudulent conversion, receiving stolen property, misrepresentation of public funds, swindling and the like.
(b) A charge of theft under sections 25.12.04.020 to 25.12.04.040 which fairly apprises the defendant of the nature of the charges against him shall not be deemed insufficient because it fails to specify a particular category of theft. The defendant may be found guilty of theft under such a charge if his conduct falls under sections 25.12.04.020 and 25.12.04.040, so long as the conduct proved is sufficiently related to the conduct charged that the accused is not unfairly surprised by the case he must meet.

A person is guilty of theft if:
(a) He intentionally obtains services, known by him to be available only for compensation, by deception, threat, false token or other means to avoid payment for the services: or
(b) Having control over the disposition of services of another to which he is not entitled, he knowingly diverts those services to his own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto.

Section 25.16.12170 Soliciting and Panhandling
1. Statement of Purpose. The intent and purpose of this section is to promote and protect the public health, welfare and safety of the City, its residents and visitors. The City finds that that the activity of begging, panhandling or soliciting the occupants or operators of vehicles from any roadway, highway, street, ally, driveway, median strip within or between a public roadway distracts drivers and creates a potential safety hazard or pedestrians and motorists. The activity of soliciting from occupants of vehicles distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and pedestrians and be alert for potential hazards and to observe all traffic control signals, signs or warnings. Distracted drivers are more prone to be involved in accidents, and accidents on the streets constitute a substantial traffic safety problem.
Solicitation near school and churches presents a potentially threatening environment
Page 389 of 878
and raises concerns regarding public health, welfare and safety of the City, its residents and visitors. Soliciting in a manner that is confrontational and involves conduct that is perceived by the person being solicited as harassing, coercing, or intimidating or which obstructs the free passage of that individual is detrimental to the quality of life and economic vitality of the community.
This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising his or her constitutional right to solicit, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity, but rather to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitations and to eliminate a source of traffic hazards and delays.
2. Definitions. Whenever the following words and phrases are used in this section, they shall have the following meanings:
(a) Aggressive Panhandling. Shall mean engaging in any conduct with the intention of intimidating another person, or in reckless disregard of the fact that another person is intimidated by his/her conduct, into giving away money or goods, including but not limited to, approaching, speaking to or following a person in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent physical injury or the imminent commission of a criminal act upon the person or upon property in the persons immediate possession; touching another person without consent, continuing to solicit after the person gives a negative response to the request; using violent or threatening gestures or language in conjunction with the solicitation; or engaging in any conduct intended to or likely to intimidate a person into responding affirmatively to the solicitation.
(b) Panhandling or Soliciting. For purposes of this section, panhandling, solicit, soliciting and solicitation are interchangeable and mean employment of the spoken, written or printed word or other acts as are conducted in the furtherance of the purpose of collecting money or any item of value for the use of ones self or others; or attempting to sell or obtain compensation for items or services under circumstances that would leave a reasonable person to conclude that the payment is in substance donation.
(c) Public Area. Shall mean an area to which the public or a substantial group of persons has access, and includes, but is not limited to, any street, highway, sidewalk, parking lot, plaza, transportation facility, school or school grounds, place of amusement, park, playground, and any doorway, entrance, hallway, lobby and other portion of any business establishment, an apartment, house or hotel not constituting a room or apartment designed for actual residence.

This area shall include the five hundred feet in any direction from the center of the intersection of 23rd Street and Highway 22. 3. Prohibition. It shall be unlawful for any
Page 390 of 878

(f) Solicit within 100 feet of any church or other religious establishment
3. This section does not apply to solicitations made on private property with the prior consent of the owner or other person in legal possession of the property. The section also does not apply to solicitations made by any person or entity that has obtained a special use permit or a temporary use permit from the City of Dickinson.
4. Penalty. A person who violates this Section by engaging in any of the conduct outlined in subsection 3(a)-(f) is guilty of an infraction. A motorist that stops the free flow of traffic at the intersections and exit ramps identified above for the purpose of engaging a person who is panhandling shall be cited under Chapter 23 of the Dickinson Municipal Code.

(d) If an ordinance provides that conduct is an infraction without specifically including a requirement of culpability, no culpability is required.
(e) Except as provided in this section, section 25.20.010 or section 25.20.020, or as the context may otherwise indicate a differentiation between the infraction classification and the offense classification, the term "offense" refers to all violations of the ordinances of the city including infractions. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-03.1.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)

When an organization is convicted of an offense, the court may, in addition to any other sentence which may be imposed, require the organization to give notice of its conviction to the
Page 393 of 878
persons or class of persons ostensibly harmed by the offense, by mail or by advertising in designated areas or by designated media or otherwise. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-03.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.20.050 Factors to be considered in sentencing
The following factors, or the converse thereof where appropriate, while not controlling the discretion of the court, shall be accorded weight in making determinations regarding the desirability of sentencing an offender to imprisonment:
(a) The defendant's criminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious harm to another person or his property.
(b) The defendant did not plan or expect that his criminal conduct would cause or threaten serious harm to another person or his property.
(c) The defendant acted under strong provocation.
(d) There were substantial grounds which, though insufficient to establish a legal defense, tend to excuse or justify the defendant's conduct.
(e) The victim of the defendant's conduct induced or facilitated its commission.
(f) The defendant has made or will make restitution or reparation to the victim of his conduct for the damage or injury which was sustained.
(g) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity, or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense.
(h) The defendant's conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.
(i) The character, history and attitudes of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another crime.
(j) The defendant is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment.
(k) The imprisonment of the defendant would entail undue hardship to himself or his dependents.
(l) The defendant is elderly or in poor health.
(m) The defendant did not abuse a public position of responsibility or trust.
(n) The defendant cooperated with law-enforcement authorities by bringing other offenders to justice, or otherwise cooperated.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to require explicit reference to these factors in a presentence report or by the court as sentencing. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-04.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.20.060 Imposition of fine; response to nonpayment
(a) The court, in making a determination of the propriety of imposing a sentence to pay a fine, shall consider the following factors:
(1) The ability of the defendant to pay without undue hardship.
(2) Whether the defendant, other than a defendant organization, gained money or property as a result of commission.
(3) Whether the sentence to pay a fine will interfere with the defendant's capacity to make restitution.
(4) Whether a sentence to pay a fine will serve a valid rehabilitative purpose.
Page 394 of 878
(b) The court may allow the defendant to pay any fine or costs imposed in installments. When a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine or costs, the court shall not impose at the same time an alternative sentence to be served in the event that the fine or costs are not paid.
(c) If the defendant does not pay any fine or costs imposed, or make any required partial payment, the court, upon motion of the prosecuting attorney or on its own motion, may issue an order to show cause why the defendant should not be imprisoned for nonpayment. Unless the defendant shows that this default is excusable, the court may, after hearing, commit him to imprisonment until the fine or costs, or both, are fully paid or discharged by labor as provided in North Dakota Century Code, section 40-18-12.
The court may not commit a person under this section when the sole reason for his nonpayment is his indigency. An order or commitment under this subsection shall not be for a period in excess of thirty days. As used in this subsection, "fine" does not include a fee established pursuant to subsection (b) of section 23.80.080. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-05 and section 40-11-12.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.20.070 Probation--Generally
(a) Unless terminated as provided in subsection (b) hereof, the period during which a sentence to probation shall remain conditional and be subject to revocation is two years.
(b) The court may terminate a period of probation and discharge the defendant at any time earlier than that provided in subsection (a) above if warranted by the conduct of the defendant and the ends of justice.
(c) Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to probation can subsequently be modified or revoked, a judgment which includes such a sentence shall constitute a final judgment for all other purposes. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-06.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.20.080 Same--Conditions; revocation
(a) The conditions of probation shall be such as the court in its discretion deems reasonably necessary to ensure that the defendant will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him to do so. The court shall provide as an explicit condition of every sentence to probation that the defendant not commit another offense during the period for which the sentence remains subject to revocation.
(b) When imposing a sentence to probation, the court may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate, and may include any one or more of the following:
(1) Work faithfully at a suitable employment or faithfully pursue a course of study or of vocational training that will equip him for suitable employment.
(2) Undergo available medical or psychiatric treatment and remain in a specified institution as required for that purpose.
(3) Attend or reside in a facility established for the instruction, recreation or residence of persons on probation.
(4) Support his dependents and meet other family responsibilities.
(5) Make restitution or reparation to the victim of his conduct for the damage or injury which was sustained, or perform other reasonable assigned work. When restitution, reparation or assigned work is a condition of the sentence, the court shall proceed as provided in section 25.20.090.
Page 395 of 878
(6) Pay a fine imposed after consideration of the provisions of section 25.20.060.
(7) Refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device or other dangerous weapon unless granted written permission by the court.
(8) Refrain from excessive use of alcohol, or any use of narcotics or of another dangerous or abusable drug without a prescription.
(9) Promptly notify the court of any change of address or employment.
(10) Remain within the jurisdiction of the court, unless granted permission to leave by the court.
(11) Refrain from associating with known users or traffickers in narcotics, marijuana or other controlled substances.
(c) When a defendant is sentenced to probation, he shall be given a certificate explicitly setting forth the conditions on which he is being released.
(d) The court may, upon notice of the probationer, modify or enlarge the conditions of a sentence to probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period for which the sentence remains conditional. If the defendant violates a condition at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, the court may, pursuant to the procedure specified in North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure, 32(f), continue him on the existing sentence, without modifying or enlarging the conditions or, if such continuation, modification or enlargement is not appropriate, may impose any other sentence that was available under section 25.20.020 at the time of the initial sentencing.
(e) Jurisdiction over a probationer may be transferred from the court which imposed the sentence to another court of this state, with the concurrence of both courts. Retransfers of jurisdiction may also occur in the same manner. The court to which jurisdiction has been transferred under this subsection shall be authorized to exercise all powers permissible under this chapter over the defendant. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-07.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.20.090 Restitution or reparation
(a) Prior to imposing restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of probation, the court shall hold a hearing on the matter with notice to the prosecuting attorney and to the defendant as to the nature and amount thereof. At or following the hearing, the court shall make determinations as to:
(1) The reasonable damages sustained by the victim or victims of the criminal offense, which damages shall be limited to fruits of the criminal offense and expenses actually incurred as a direct result of the defendant's criminal action.
(2) The ability of the defendant to restore the fruits of the criminal action or to pay monetary reparations, or to otherwise take action to restore the victim's property.
(3) The likelihood that attaching a condition relating to restitution or reparation will serve a valid rehabilitational purpose in the case of the particular offender considered.
The court shall fix the amount of restitution or reparation, which shall not exceed an amount the defendant can or will be able to pay, or shall fix the manner of performance of any condition or conditions of probation established pursuant to this subsection. Any payments made pursuant to such order shall be deducted from damages awarded in a civil action arising from the same incident. An order that a defendant make restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of probation may, if the court so directs, be filed, transcribed and enforced by the person entitled
Page 396 of 878
to the restitution or reparation in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by the courts of this state may be enforced.
(b) The court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work as a condition of probation, which assigned work need not be related to the offense charged, but must not be solely for the benefit of the private individual other than the victim. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-08.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)
Section 25.20.100 Merger of sentences; sentencing for multiple offenses
(a) Unless the court otherwise orders, when a person serving a term of commitment is committed for another offense, or offenses, the shorter term or the shorter remaining term shall be merged in the other term. When a person on probation or parole for an offense committed in this city is sentenced for another offense or offenses, the period still to be served on probation or parole shall be merged in any new sentence of commitment or probation. When the court merges sentences under this subsection it shall forthwith furnish the penal facility in which the defendant is confined under sentence with authenticated copies of its sentence, which shall cite the sentences being merged. If the court has imposed a sentence which is merged pursuant to this subsection, it shall modify such sentence in accordance with the effect of the merger.
(b) A defendant may not be consecutively sentenced to more than one year. (Source: North Dakota Century Code, section 12.1-32-11.) (Ord. No. 867, § 1.)

The City endeavors to provide a safe workplace for all employees. To ensure a safe workplace and to reduce the risk of violence, all employees should review and understand
Page 418 of 878
all provisions of this workplace violence policy.
2.10.1 Prohibited Conduct
We do not tolerate any type of workplace violence committed by or against employees. Employees are prohibited from making threats or engaging in violent activities. This list of behaviors provides examples of conduct that is prohibited:
 Causing physical injury to another person.
 Making threatening remarks.
 Displaying aggressive or hostile behavior that creates a reasonable fear of injury to another person or subjects another individual to emotional distress.
 Intentionally damaging employer property or property of another employee.
 Possessing an unauthorized weapon while on City property or while on City business.
 Committing acts motivated by, or related to, sexual harassment or domestic violence.
2.10.2 Reporting Violent Situations
Any potentially dangerous situations must be immediately reported to a supervisor or the human resource (HR) department. Reports can be made anonymously, and all reported incidents will be investigated. Reports or incidents warranting confidentiality will be handled appropriately, and information will be disclosed to others only on a need-to-know basis. All parties involved in a situation will be counseled, and the results of investigations will be discussed with them. The City will actively intervene at any indication of a possibly hostile or violent situation.
2.10.3 Risk Reduction Measures
Hiring
The City takes reasonable measures to conduct background investigations to review candidates backgrounds and to reduce the risk of hiring individuals with a history of violent behavior.
Inspection
The City may conduct periodic inspections of the premises to evaluate and determine any vulnerabilities to workplace violence or hazards, and will endeavor to take corrective action to reduce known risks.
Individual Situations
Although we do not expect all employees to be skilled at identifying potentially dangerous persons, employees are expected to exercise good judgment and to inform the HR department if any employee exhibits behavior that could be a sign of a potentially dangerous situation. Such behavior includes:
 Discussing weapons in a threatening way, or bringing them to the workplace (exceptions for public safety or other authorized personnel in the course of their official duties).
 Displaying overt signs of extreme stress, resentment, hostility or anger.
 Making threatening remarks.
 Showing sudden or significant deterioration of performance.
 Displaying irrational or inappropriate behavior.
Threatening conduct, or any other acts of aggression or violence in the workplace will not be tolerated. Any employee determined to have
Page 419 of 878
committed such acts will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Non-employees engaged in violent acts on the employers premises will be reported to the proper authorities and fully prosecuted.
3. Use of Seat Belts
The City of Dickinson is committed to doing everything possible to prevent injury to employees, prevent damage to property and to protect the employees and the public from the results of accidents. The City realizes that seat belts are an important and efficient means to accomplish this goal. Thus, it is the policy that all City employees and their passengers shall be required to use seat belts when driving any city owned or leased vehicle (if equipped with seat belts) or while driving their personal vehicle on official municipal business. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action.
EXCEPTION: Police Officers may follow seat belt regulations specifically set out for law enforcement needs in the departmental policy manual.
4. Use of Tobacco Products
Use of all forms of Tobacco Products (as defined in City Code) is prohibited in/on City vehicles, equipment and properties, unless the area is clearly marked by the City as a tobacco use area.
5. Conflicts of Interest Considerations of Outside Employment and/or Business Dealings
5.1 Submitting requests
Although the City does not forbid off hours employment by employees, employees are prohibited from having business dealings or seeking or maintaining employment, which conflicts with the responsibilities or performance of the employee's City position. Therefore any requests for business dealings or outside employment must be submitted in writing on a city authorized form, an exhibit of which accompanies this document, and approved by the employees Department Head prior to an employee engaging in such a relationship. Such approval will be required annually.
5.2 Review by Management
Following a review of the request, the Department Head will determine whether such employment interferes or negatively impacts the performance of the employees duties with the City or results in a conflict of interest. Based on his/her review of the facts, the Department Head will notify the employee in writing of his/her decision to approve of the outside employment/business dealings or not. If the Department Head refuses to approve of the outside employment/business dealing, the employee may file a grievance as described in section 29.08.04.120.
5.3 Disciplinary Matters
If the Department Head refuses to approve of the outside employment/business dealing and the employee pursues the outside employment/business dealings, said employee may be subject to disciplinary action. An employee performing outside employment or business on City time shall be subject to disciplinary action.
5.4 Requests by Department Heads
In the case of a Department Head seeking approval of outside employment, the request will be made to the City Administrator, who will decide the appropriateness of the request.
Page 420 of 878
5.5 Reporting injuries while working for others
Employees must report illness or injury due to secondary employment to their supervisor. The Citys Workers' Compensation insurance coverage will not be extended to outside employment.
6. Performance Evaluations
6.1 Purpose and use of Performance Evaluations
Performance evaluations are designed to provide the employee with a record of his/her performance, to encourage professional growth and to promote communication between the supervisor and employee.
Performance evaluations are to be structured to each employee's position.
The purpose of the evaluation is to commend strengths, address opportunities for growth, suggest ways to improve, discuss employee goals and objectives, and discuss any difficulties and positive aspects the employee may be experiencing on the job. Completed evaluations (for exempt employees) may also serve as the basis and justification for merit based raises and/or promotions awarded to employees.
6.2 Frequency of Performance Evaluations
Performance appraisals will be conducted before the end of the employee's probationary period and at least once each year thereafter. Evaluations may be performed more often as need arises.
6.3 Completion of Evaluation Forms
The first step in the performance evaluation process is completion of evaluation forms. Evaluation forms will be completed by the supervisor, the employee, and others.
6.4 Performance Evaluation Conference
The purpose of the performance evaluation conference is to discuss the written evaluation forms completed by the supervisor, the employee, and others. The performance evaluation conference will be conducted by the employee's supervisor.
6.5 Signing Requirement
Employees are required to sign their evaluations and will receive a copy upon request. Signing does not imply agreement, but that the contents have been made known to and discussed with the employee. If the employee refuses to sign the evaluation form, the supervisor shall document the refusal and submit the evaluation and documentation to Human Resources. (Code 1637 § 1).
6.6 Placement in Personnel File
Completed evaluation forms shall be submitted to the City Administrator for placement in the employee's personnel file.
7. Policy on Personnel Records
7.1 Personnel Files
It is the policy of the City to maintain accurate and updated information on each municipal employee in its personnel files. The personnel file will include documents related to the employees history with the city. Payroll information, I-9 forms and confidential/medical information will be maintained in separate files.
7.2 Maintenance of personnel files
The City Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining personnel records for all current and former employees.
7.3 Employee access to files
The employee shall have reasonable access to his/her personnel records upon
Page 421 of 878

12.2 Protected Health Information
Recent HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) legislation requires that the City provide a statement to employees regarding Protected Health Information (PHI). The City is a covered entity under HIPAA because we sponsor a health plan and a flex benefits plan which has a medical spending account feature. This means the City is required by law to maintain the privacy of employee health information.
PHI, or Protected Health Information means information that might identify an employee, including past present or future physical or mental conditions; provision of health care; or payment for care.
The City is permitted to use and disclose certain information without authorizations as in the following: to provide patient care through the health plan providers; to obtain payment for services; or to operate a health or flex plan.
Summary plan descriptions (SPDs) through the health care providers describe how employee health information will be protected through methods adopted by them as providers.
The City allows access to PHI only by those persons working on and within the
Page 425 of 878
plan, referred to as the Plan Workforce. This includes information that is within payroll, Human Resources, accounting staff who process applications for coverage and billing statements.
In all cases, no PHI will be disclosed by the Plan Workforce outside the HIPAA privacy rules.
Training will be provided to the Plan Workforce.
Sanctions are adopted for violations of this disclosure policy, up to and including termination of employment of the offending party.
Under HIPAA, employees can request their own information and how it is used; they may request that their information be disclosed to others. These requests are to be in writing to one of the privacy officials of the City, which include: The City Administrator, the City Attorney, or the Human Resource Coordinator.

This policy outlines the use of personal mobile devices at work, use of city provided mobile devices and all mobile device equipment, safety issues, the issuance of mobile devices and additional information.
13.2 Department Head responsibilities
Each department head is responsible for determining whether an employees job duties require the City provide a mobile device or stipend to an employee. Once a department head has made a determination a city issued mobile device is required for an employee to effectively carry out their assigned duties the City will cover all legitimate business charges related to the City issued mobile device. If a department head determines that the issuance of a city mobile device is not essential for an employee but the use of a personal mobile device is desired, they can authorize a monthly stipend which will be taxed as an income event on the employees paycheck. The monthly stipend will be set annually during the budget process. When a stipend is provided it represents the total compensation an employee will receive regarding the use of a personal mobile device for business purposes.

Personal mobile devices, when a stipend is provided, are subject to the provisions of this policy.
Mobile device records, including phone and data transmissions, can be subject to public disclosure under the State of North Dakota Open Records laws.

Employees unable to present the phone/equipment in good working condition within one (1) business day may be required to bear the cost of

Employees whose job responsibilities include regular or occasional driving are encouraged to refrain from using mobile devices while driving. Employees are strongly encouraged to pull off to a reasonably safe location and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting a call. If acceptance of a call is unavoidable while driving and pulling over is not an option, employees are strongly encouraged to use hands-free devices. In situations where a City mobile device has been issued and the employees job responsibilities include regular driving and accepting of business calls, hands-free equipment will be provided to facilitate the provisions of this policy. Employees who are charged with traffic violations resulting from the use of a mobile devices while driving on duty may be subject to disciplinary action and personal liability resulting from such traffic violations.

Purpose
It is recognized that most people face personal difficulties at some point in their lives. Given this reality, the city of Dickinson EAP is committed to assisting employees with distress as a means of facilitating 1) a resolution of problems and 2) the maintenance of satisfactory job performance. For this reason, the City is offering all regular full-time and regular part-time benefited employees access to an Employee Assistance Program, the use of which is described in this subsection. In pursuing the above objective, the EAP can be used by employees to help prevent problems from hindering ones capacity to fulfill job requirements.

Employees wishing to use this program may contact the EAP provider in accordance with the provisions of the program. EAP may be used in one of two primary ways:

An employee experiencing difficulties may, on his/her own initiative, seek information, guidance, or personal therapy. In this pursuit of assistance, the employees confidentiality will be maintained. The City of Dickinson EAP is a pre-paid benefit for regular full time employees and their family members. If services are needed beyond the scope of the EAP, a recommendation to a preferred provider will be made. If this occurs and the employee accepts the referral, the employee will be financially responsible and may be able to use their health insurance based on approval of the insurer.
18.10.3 Employer Involvement
When an employees job performance is determined to be unsatisfactory as a result of personal difficulties caused by on or off the job circumstances, the employee s supervisor has the option of encouraging the use of the EAP. In cases where there is a serious concern, as determined by the Department Head, about the employee s performance, the Supervisor, working with the Human Resource Coordinator, may require participation in the EAP as part of an action plan. When the EAP is used in this manner, the city of Dickinson may request of the provider a verification of the employees appointments and treatment completion. Further, if such an employee refuses the referral to the EAP as part of an action plan, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with Section 29.08.04110 of this manual.

18.17.1 Sick Leave Bank Administration
Sick Leave Bank Administration will be conducted by Human Resources and other appointees by the City Administrator.
Page 443 of 878
18.17.2 Membership and Eligibility
Employees will become participants in the SLB by donating hours at the beginning of employment or as provided in Paragraph 18.17.3. Donations of sick leave to the SLB are non-refundable, except in the event of the termination of the SLB. In the event the SLB is terminated, the total number of hours on deposit shall be returned proportionately to the then participating members and credited to their sick leave accumulation, not to exceed the employees original donation.
Employees participating in the SLB may cancel their participation in the SLB at any time, by submitting written notice of cancellation to the City Administrator. Membership withdrawal, as well as termination of employment, shall result in forfeiture of all hours contributed.
A member shall lose the right to obtain the benefits of the SLB by:
 termination of employment, including resignation, involuntary termination, and retirement;
 cancellation of participation;
 refusal to honor such assessment as may be required by the SLB;
 refusal to comply with the policies and procedures of the plan; or
 determination of permanent disability by the Social Security Administration (SSA).
An SLB grant shall only be used by the individual member for his/her personal catastrophic or terminal illness or injury. Participation in the SLB is voluntary, but requires an initial contribution to the SLB and subsequent contributions as assessed in accordance with this policy. Only contributors will be allowed to receive grants from the SLB with the exception of specific employee donations of leave through the SLB as described insection 18.17.3.
Persons off work due to a normal pregnancy and delivery shall not be eligible to receive an SLB grant. The SLB shall not be used by a SLB member disabled by an injury covered by Workers Compensation. The existence of the SLB and participation by an employee does not negate or eliminate any other sick leave policies of the City, nor does it in any way negate the rights of an individual who participates in the SLB to any other sick leave benefits. (Code 1637 § 1)
18.17.3 Sick Leave Bank Contributions
A 16 hour sick leave assessment shall occur for each participating employee at the beginning of employment. Employees who do not opt into the SLB at the beginning of employment may opt in during the benefit election period for the next two plan years. All employees of the City shall have a one-time opportunity during the 2018 benefit election period to opt into the SLB if they have not done so. Following this one time election opportunity, any employee who is not otherwise entitled to an additional plan year for election as provided hereunder shall have no further opportunities to opt in, except as herein provided. The required initial sick leave assessment will be pro-rated for Regular Part-Time employees to the average number of hours that employee works. If an employee leaves the SLB, they may not re-enter in the future.
An employee drawing SLB benefits shall not be required to contribute any assessment or make back payments for assessments required while that person was drawing SLB benefits.
Page 444 of 878
Upon initial adoption of the Human Resources Manual, the City shall contribute 800 hours (100 days) to the SLB. The Board of City Commissioners may be requested by the SLB to contribute additional time as necessary at future dates to keep the plan solvent depending on the number of employees receiving benefits following adoption of the plan.
All participants of the SLB, who are Regular Full-Time Employees may be assessed an additional eight hours of sick leave if it is determined to be necessary, but in no case shall a participant be required to donate more than that additional amount per request. There is no limit to the number of times the SLB may assess additional hours from its members. This assessment will be pro-rated for members, who are Regular Part-time employees based on the average number of hours that employee worked per week for the year prior to the assessment.
Any employee who is rehired within one year of being laid off, who was a member of the sick leave bank prior to lay-off, will not be required to again make an initial time donation to the SLB in order to be a member. Likewise, any employee who is laid off and rehired within one year, who was not a member of the SLB prior to the lay-off will be ineligible to become a member upon rehire.
Member employees may make general donations of leave to the SLB that are not directed to any specific employee whenever an employee so desires.
Employees (members or non-members) may donate leave to specific employees upon the request of a specific employee. Employees wishing to request donated leave from other employees must make the request through the Human Resources Coordinator and must have exhausted all of their own accrued leave time (sick, vacation, personal leave, and floating holiday) before requesting donated leave. The Human Resources Coordinator shall submit the request to all City employees. The requesting partys name shall not be included in the request unless the requesting party specifically consents in writing to their name being released with the request. Employees shall not be required to consent to the use of their name in the request. The SLB reserves the right to set a limit on the amount of leave any individual employee may grant per request to a specific employee with ongoing catastrophic or terminal illnesses, in order to insure that no more than 160 donated sick leave hours are on the books for any one Regular Full-Time Employee per request. Likewise, the maximum hours of donated sick leave carried on the books at any one time for a Regular Part-time Employee will not exceed the equivalent of four weeks at the average number of hours said employee worked for the year prior to receiving SLB or donated sick leave hours. The maximum number of hours an employee can receive through direct donations during their employment with the City is 320. Should donations of time fall below that needed to maintain the recipient employee on full-time status, said employee will lose that status. Employees who wish to donate leave to a specific employee as provided hereunder may not donate leave in an amount which would cause the donating employee to have less than 160 hours of leave remaining for their own use. (Code 1637 § 1)
18.17.4 Sick Leave Bank Usage
Prior to being eligible to draw any hours from the SLB, or to receive sick leave donations from employees, recipients shall be required to exhaust all accrued sick leave, vacation leave, personal leave, and holidays.
Page 445 of 878
With the exception of specific employee donated grants of sick leave as described in section 18.17.3, any employee requesting an SLB grant must be a member of the SLB.
SLB participants shall not be eligible to receive SLB benefits until the employee has been off work for at least 160 working hours, unless the employee or his/her representative provides adequate evidence to the City Administrator that recent past major illness(es) have made it impossible to accumulate sufficient accruals to cover the 160 working hours requirement.
While receiving SLB benefits or a specific donation of leave, an employee shall not accrue any sick leave or vacation leave, nor will the employee be eligible to receive compensation for any holidays.
Not more than 240 hours shall be granted in any one grant even though an individual may be eligible to receive multiple grants up to a total of 720 hours. Applicants may submit requests for a SLB grant(s) or extensions of a SLB grant(s) before the prior grant(s) or other requirements of this policy have expired.
Regular Part-Time Employees will be eligible to receive SLB benefits prorated to the average number of hours they work. (Code 1637 § 1)
18.17.5 Maintenance and Reporting of Sick Leave Bank Records
The City Administrator shall maintain the records of all applications for donations, applications for withdrawal grants, and all cancellations.
The City Administrator shall maintain records of all SLB participants as well as their contributions and successful withdrawal grants, and the status of the SLB.
If a SLB grant recipient does not use all of the hours granted from the SLB, the unused hours shall remain in the SLB.
All appropriate SLB forms are available from the City Administrator. City Administrator will annually distribute an administrative report reflective of SLB activity. (Code 1637 § 1)
18.17.6 Dissolution of the Sick Leave Bank
In the event the SLB is dissolved, the Sick Leave Bank Administrators shall determine the terms under which the SLB may be dissolved, and will establish guidelines for distribution of remaining balances.
18.18 Training and Tuition Reimbursement
18.18.1 Objective
The City will endeavor to support employees who wish to continue their education to secure increased responsibility and growth within their professional careers. In keeping with this philosophy, the City has established a reimbursement program for expenses incurred through approved institutions of learning. Full time regular employees who have completed their probationary period are eligible to participate.
18.18.2 Job-Related Training
Department heads may within budgetary constraints, plan, schedule and pay for any job-related training essential to the work assigned for regular full time and regular part time employees. This may include tuition, coursework, seminars, conference fees, as well as travel costs. Normally this training is provided during duty hours. If the training is conducted beyond duty hours, the overtime provisions
Page 446 of 878
of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for non-exempt employees must be applied.
18.18.3 Tuition Reimbursement Budget
The City will include in its budget annually an amount for continuing education. The City will advise employees of the budgeted amount each year for continuing education. Approvals will be based upon the number of applications received and the amount budgeted, as well as the City Administrators discretion in carrying out the vision and mission of the City. A maximum of $1.500.00 will be available to any one employee per semester (or semester equivalent).
18.18.4 Stipulations for Tuition Reimbursement
These reimbursements are not for job-related training as described above, and are for education events performed on the employees own time. The employee must be in good standing at the time of the application for tuition reimbursement. The continuing education program must correspond to an accredited program that either offers growth in an area related to the employees current position, or that might lead to promotional opportunities. This may include courses for college credit, continuing education credit courses, seminars, and certification exams. A grade of C or its equivalent is required for reimbursement. Expenses must be validated by receipts, and a copy of the final grade or a completion certificate must be presented. In some cases, books and study materials may be included in the reimbursement request. The City will reimburse up to 70% of approved costs.
18.18.5 Procedures for Applying for Tuition Reimbursement
 The employee provides his or her manager with information about the course of study.
 A tuition reimbursement form will be completed with appropriate signatures prior to the employee enrolling in the course. Final approval will be decided upon by the City Administrator in conjunction with the appropriate department head, and the HR Coordinator.
 The applicant is informed of the approval, and the amount of reimbursement approved.
 The original form is maintained by the employee, with a copy given to Human Resources.
 The employee then enrolls in the course.
 Upon completion, the employee submits the original, along with receipts and other documentation.
 The employee is reimbursed by the payroll department.
18.18.6 Limitations
The City will endeavor to make reimbursements equitable across departments, and to qualifying employees within budgetary restrictions. It shall retain the right to limit approvals or approval dollars so that the tuition reimbursement program will have maximum benefit to the most employees and to the Citys needs.
An employee who resigns or is terminated while attending a course previously approved for reimbursement will not receive reimbursement. An employee who leaves employment with the City within one year of receiving tuition
Page 447 of 878
reimbursement must repay the tuition on a pro-rated basis. The City will consider exceptions in extreme cases of health or safety.

In the case where a denial of vacation leave would cause an employee to lose vacation leave at year end due to vacation accrual carry-over rules, refer to Section 29.08.04090.19.1.5. In normal operating situations, the City of Dickinson will make every effort possible to accommodate employee requests for vacation time off.

19.2.11 Benefits Available to Employee Claiming On-the-Job Injury
The ultimate goal for the City is a no lost time rule, which means when feasible as determined by the City, the City will make accommodations for workers injured on the job making it possible for them to work while injured. It is possible the work assignment will be different from the employee's normal job assignment. During such assignment, the employee will be compensated at his/her normal rate of pay. However, if a Workers Compensation claim is approved for an on the job injury, which includes time lost from work and the employee had any hours charged to their accrued sick leave balance for the period before the claim was approved, the leave charged will be credited back to the employees sick leave accrual balance for the time covered by the Workers Compensation benefits for the initial period. If an employee is collecting benefits from an approved Workers Compensation claim, the employee may use sick leave to supplement payments from Workers Compensation up to the employees regular rate of pay, based on a standard work week for the employee.

or use their floating holiday.
19.6 Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) Benefits
The City complies with the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act, and its implementing regulations, as may be amended from time to time. This policy is intended to provide employees with a general description of rights and obligations under FMLA. In the event of any conflict between this policy and the applicable law, employees will be afforded all rights required by law.
The City shall grant to employees up to 12 weeks of leave (or up to 26 weeks of military caregiver leave for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness) during a 12-month period to eligible employees. The leave may be paid, unpaid, or a combination of paid and unpaid leave, depending on the circumstances of the leave and as specified in this policy. Employees who are on approved FMLA leave may not engage in any form of self-employment or perform work for any other employer during that leave, except when the leave is for military or jury or witness duty as defined in Section 19.8. (Ord. No. 1557 § 1) B.
19.6.1 Eligibility
To qualify for FMLA leave, the employee must meet all of the following conditions:
The employee must have worked for the City for 12 months. The 12 months need not have been consecutive. If the employee has a break in service that lasted seven years or more, the time worked prior to the break will not be counted unless the break in service is due to service covered by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), or there is a written agreement outlining the Citys intention to rehire the employee after the break in service;
The employee must have worked for the City at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately before the date when the leave is requested. Time spent on paid or unpaid leave is not counted as hours worked.
19.6.2 Type of Leave Covered
To qualify for FMLA leave, the employee must be taking leave for one of the following reasons:
The birth of a child and to care for that child, or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child;
To care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition (as defined in FMLA and its implementing regulations); for a serious health condition (as defined in FMLA and its implementing regulations) that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job; or for any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status.
A serious health condition is defined by FMLA and its implementing regulations as: a condition that requires an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or other residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care; a condition that incapacitates the employee or a family member for more than three consecutive full calendar days and any subsequent treatment or a period of incapacity relating to the same condition that also involves: (a) treatment two or more times within 30 days
Page 453 of 878
of the first day of incapacity (unless extenuating circumstances exist) by a health care provider, by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or (b) treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion that results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider. The first (or only) treatment by a health care provider must be an in-person visit and take place within seven days of the first day of incapacity. A regimen of continuing treatment includes, for example, a course of prescription medication or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition.
 any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or prenatal care;
 any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition that requires periodic visits at least twice per year to a health care provider, continues over an extended period of time, and may cause episodic rather an continuing period of incapacity;
 a period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective, but requires continuing supervision of a health care provider;
 any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a health care provider for (a) restorative surgery after an accident or other injury or (b) a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive full calendar days without the treatments.
Employees with questions about what conditions are covered under this FMLA policy or under the Citys sick leave policy are encouraged to consult with the Citys Human Resources Coordinator.
If an employee takes paid sick leave for a condition that progresses into a serious health condition, and the employee requests unpaid leave as provided under this policy, the City may designate all or some portion of related leave taken as leave under this FMLA policy, to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications.
19.6.3 FMLA Qualifying Leave for Families of Members of the National Guard or Reserves
The City shall follow the requirements of FMLA and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), and their respective implementing regulations, with respect to qualifying exigency leave for families of members of the National Guard or Reserves.
19.6.4 Amount of Leave
An eligible employee can take up to 12 weeks of FMLA qualifying leave under this policy (and up to 26 weeks of FMLA qualifying military care giver leave) during any 12-month period. The 12-month period is measured as a rolling 12-month period, measured backward from the date on which the employees uses any FMLA leave under this policy. Each time the employee takes qualifying FMLA, the City shall compute the amount of FMLA leave the employee has taken in the previous 12 months and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available FMLA leave. The balance remaining is the amount of FMLA leave that the employee is entitled
Page 454 of 878
to take at that time.
If both spouses work for the City, and each wishes to take FMLA leave for the birth of a child, adoption or placement of a child in foster care, or to care for any parent (but not a parent-in-law) with a serious health condition, the spouses may only take a combined 12 weeks of FMLA leave (or a combined 26 weeks of qualifying FMLA leave to care for a covered injured or ill service member).
19.6.5 Employee Status and Benefits During Leave
While an employee is on qualifying FMLA leave, the City will continue the employees health insurance benefits during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the employee had continued to work.
Under current City policy, the employee pays a portion of the health care premium. While on paid leave, the employer will continue to make payroll deductions to collect the employees portion of the premium. While on unpaid leave, the employee must make this payment to the City, either in person or by mail. The payment must be received in the Finance Department by the 5th day of each month. If the payment is more than 30 days late, the employees health care coverage may be discontinued for the duration of the leave. The City shall provide at least 15 days notice prior to the employees loss of coverage.
If the employee contributes to other employer-sponsored employment benefits (such as life insurance or supplemental insurance), the City will continue to make payroll deductions for such benefits while the employee is on paid leave. While on unpaid leave, the employee may elect to maintain such benefits and pay the employees portion of the premiums. The payment must be received in the Finance Department by the 5th day of each month. If such payment is not received, the employee shall be deemed to have elected to terminate participation in such employer-sponsored employment benefits.
19.6.6 Employee Status After Leave
An employee who takes qualifying FMLA leave may be asked to provide a fitness for duty clearance from a health care provider prior to returning to work. The City may also require a fitness for duty certification up to once every 30 days for an employee taking intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding the employee's ability to perform his or her duties based on the condition for which leave was taken.
Generally, an employee who takes qualifying FMLA leave will be able to return to the same position or a position with equivalent status, pay, benefits, or other employment terms. Pursuant to FMLA regulations, the City may choose to exempt certain key employees from this requirement and not return them to the same or a similar position.
19.6.7 Use of Paid and Unpaid Leave
An employee who is taking FMLA leave must use all accrued leave time (whether vacation leave, sick, leave, personal leave, or otherwise) prior to being eligible for unpaid leave. Use of such accrued leave time shall run concurrently with qualifying FMLA leave.
19.6.7.1 Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule
An employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently (take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under
Page 455 of 878
certain circumstances, may use the leave to reduce the workweek or workday, resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of 12 work weeks (or 26 work weeks for qualifying military care giver leave) over a 12 month period.
In instances where the FMLA leave is foreseeable (including recovery from an employees serious health condition, the serious health condition of a family member, or to care for a child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care) the City may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits if the alternative position would better accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule. For the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child, the City and the employee must mutually agree to the intermittent or reduced schedule prior to the employee taking FMLA leave. Leave for the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child, must be taken within one year of such birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
If the employee is taking leave for a serious health condition or because of the serious health condition of a family member, the employee should attempt to reach agreement with the City prior to taking intermittent leave or a reduced hour schedule. If this is not possible, the employee must prove that such intermittent leave or reduced hour schedule is medically necessary.
19.6.7.2 Certification of Serious Health Condition
Pursuant to FMLA implementing regulations, the City will require certification of an employees serious health condition or the serious health condition of an employees family member. The employee must respond to such a request within 15 days or provide a reasonable explanation for the delay. Failure to provide certification may result in denial of continuation of leave. The City may ask for a second opinion or third opinion of a medical professional if the City has reason to doubt the certification given. The City may request recertification of a serious health condition, but no more frequently than once every 30 days Such certifications, re-certifications, and additional opinions are governed by FMLA implementing regulations, and the City shall follow such implementing regulations.
19.6.8 Procedure for Requesting FMLA Leave
All employees requesting FMLA leave must provide verbal or written notice of the need for the leave to the HR Coordinator. The HR Coordinator shall notify the employee of his or her eligibility to take leave, and inform the employee of his or her rights and responsibilities under the FMLA. Absent extenuating circumstances, the City shall notify the employee of whether the employee is eligible to take FMLA leave within five business days of the employee requesting leave or the employer learning that an employees leave may be for a FMLA-qualifying reason. If the City determines that the employee is not eligible for FMLA leave, the City shall provide the employee with the reason why the employee is ineligible. When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employee must provide the City with at least 30 days notice. When the employee becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in advance, the employee must provide the City with notice of a need for FMLA leave as soon as practicable (normally the same day or the next business day). If the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, the employee shall comply with the Citys usual and
Page 456 of 878
customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances.
19.6.9 Intent to Return to Work from FMLA Leave

19.7 Voluntary Leave Without Pay
Any request for leave without pay must be submitted to the Department Head on a Request for Leave form. Requests for such leave not exceeding two (2) working days shall be permitted at the discretion of the appropriate Department Head. Requests for such leave exceeding two (2) working days, shall be at the discretion of the City Administrator. It is the policy of the City of Dickinson that in circumstances such as these, vacation will be used in full before leave without pay is granted. In no case shall the City permit leave without pay to continue longer than six months. During any such leave lasting more than one pay period, the employee will be ineligible for employer paid benefits and accruals of leave benefits will halt during the leave. In the case of health insurance, the employee will be permitted to stay on the City policy, but must pay the policy in full during the time of leave, with the choice to stay on the policy being made before commencement of the leave.

Section 29.08.04100 Separation From Municipal Service
20. Separation from Service
20.1 Definitions
Voluntary Separation: Written resignation, extended absence without proper notification, or retirement. Voluntary separation is initiated by the employee.
Page 459 of 878
Involuntary Separation: Layoff or discharge. Involuntary separation is initiated by the employer.
20.2 Return of City Property
City of Dickinson employees are expected to return all City property at the time of their separation from municipal service. The City of Dickinson reserves the right to withhold from the employee's final paycheck the amount for any property that is not returned or for which there is no explanation for the absence of the property. The City of Dickinson may take further action if necessary to recover municipal property.
20.3 Voluntary Separation
Resignation
A City of Dickinson employee, in order to resign in good-standing and be eligible for re-employment must resign from municipal service by giving their Department Head written notice of his/her resignation at least two weeks in advance of their leaving municipal service. In extenuating circumstances, the City Administrator may accept an employee's resignation with less than two weeks notice and retain their good standing status upon separation. It is the Department Heads responsibility to forward the original letter of resignation to the City Administrator within two working days of submission by the employee.
Un-notified Absence
If an employee is absent for more than two (2) consecutive shifts without proper notification in accordance with the attendance policy, they shall be considered to have voluntarily resigned their position with the City. Re-instatement upon presentation of extenuating circumstances or reason for such absence shall be at the discretion of the City Administrator. Any un-notified absence may result in disciplinary action.
20.4 Involuntary Separation
Layoffs
Employees will be subject to layoff when it is deemed necessary by reason of shortage of work, the abolition of the employees position or other material changes in the duties or organization of his department. The duties performed by an employee so laid off may be reassigned to other employees already working in appropriate employment classes. No regular or probationary employee shall be laid off while another person in a competitive position is employed on a provisional or temporary basis in the same class in that department. At the discretion of the City Commission, any employee subject to such layoff may be granted a leave of absence without pay (see Section 29.08.04090.19.7).
No temporary or permanent separation of an employee from employment as a penalty or disciplinary action shall be considered as a layoff.
In cases of layoff of employees, consideration will be given to the employees performance record, their length of service, and the needs of the City and/or Department involved.
The City Administrator shall give written notice to the affected employee(s) of any proposed layoff with reasons therefore a reasonable time period prior to the effective date thereof.
At the discretion of the City Administrator, an employee on lay-off may be offered positions that come open for which he/she is qualified to fill. The employee
Page 460 of 878
on lay-off, who is offered an open position, will have two weeks from the date of offer to accept the position. If the position offered to an employee on lay-off is equal in grade to the position which the employee lost and the employee fails to accept the position offered, said employee shall be removed from lay-off status. If the employee on lay-off accepts the position offered within the two week time frame, the employee will be permitted up to two additional weeks to report to work. Unless stated extenuating circumstances are agreed to by the City, if the employee fails to start the job within the two week time frame, the employee will lose his/her opportunity to receive the position and will lose his/her lay-off status. Employees will be offered positions, based on availability and qualification in reverse order of the lay-off process.
Reductions in Force
It may be necessary for the City to terminate a position within the City due to budgetary constraints or reorganization. An employee terminated as part of a reduction in force is deemed to be terminated and the city will not be required to give the employee preference for other open positions within the City.
The distinguishing factor between a layoff and a reduction in force is the reason for the termination of employment. In a layoff, an employee is removed from their current position due to a lack of work for that position. A layoff is considered temporary while the City looks for other opportunities within the City, which the employee could fulfill. If a new assignment is offered to an employee, but the employee refuses, the layoff is permanent, and the employee will be removed from layoff status, and deemed to have been terminated.
A reduction in force is due to budgetary constraints, which cause the elimination of a position, or re-organization of a department. Employees who are terminated because of a force reduction are deemed to be terminated, and do not have the position mobility that layoffs afford.
Non-Layoff Involuntary Separation
The City Administrator may terminate the employment of an employee for disciplinary reasons, poor performance, failure or inability to perform the essential duties of his/her assigned classification.
Procedures following Involuntary Separation
In cases of involuntary separation for disciplinary reasons, the process set forth in Section 29.08.04110 Disciplinary Process will be followed. In cases of involuntary separation for disciplinary reasons, poor performance, failure or inability to perform the essential duties of his/her assigned classification and the procedures in Section 29.08.04.120 Grievance and Appeal Procedures will be available.
20.5 Exit Interviews
It is a policy of the City of Dickinson, for Human Resources, to conduct an exit interview prior to an employee's separation from City employment whenever reasonably possible. In the case of a terminating Human Resources employee, the exit interview may be conducted by the City Administrator. The exit interview is conducted for several purposes, including: 1) to resolve all outstanding matters between the City and the employee; 2) to advise the employee of the affect their separation will have upon all benefits and what benefits they have coming upon separation; and 3) to aid the City in
Page 461 of 878
gathering information to help improve the municipality's working environment and other employment relationships.
At the time or prior to the time of the exit interview, employees are expected to return all municipal property as specified in Section 29.08.04100.20.2. (Code 1958 § 9-25; Ord. No. 376; Ord. No. 721 § 4; Ord. No. 918 § 1; Ord. No. 920 §§ 1, 2; Ord. No. 967 § 9; Ord. No. 1090 § 1; Ord. No. 1163 § 5; Ord. No. 1307 § 13, Code 1637 § 1)

Records of disciplinary actions are maintained in the employees personnel file at City Hall. These records will be maintained the employees personnel file in accordance with the Citys personnel record retention practices. For the purpose of determining pay increases, promotions, advancement, or other enhancements, an employees disciplinary record which consists only of written reprimands may not be considered if the last written reprimand occurred more than three years prior.

Section 29.08.04130 Drug and Alcohol Policy
City of Dickinson's Commitment to Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace
The City of Dickinson has a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe, healthful, and productive work environment and to promote high standards of employee health. Consistent with the spirit and intent of this objective the City will act to eliminate any substance and alcohol abuse which could impair an employee's ability to safely and effectively perform a particular job and which increases the potential for accidents, absenteeism, sub-standard performance, and tends to undermine public confidence in the City's work force. The City's goals are to establish and maintain a work environment that is free from the effects of alcohol and drug abuse and to maintain the reputation and integrity of the City of Dickinson by preventing unacceptable behavior by its employees that discredits the City and its employees.
While the City has no intention of unreasonably intruding into the private lives of its employees, the City expects employees to report for work in a condition to perform their duties, make the work environment safe for other employees, and represent a proper image to the citizens. It is clear that employee off-the-job, as well as on-the-job, involvement with drugs and alcohol can have an impact on the City's goals.
23.1 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policies
The following are the policies of the City regarding drug and alcohol abuse:
Page 465 of 878
1. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of controlled drugs or substances, or the use of alcohol while on duty, on or off property owned or leased by the City is proper cause for disciplinary action.
2. Any illegal controlled drug or substance possessed while on duty by employees will be turned over to the appropriate criminal justice agencies and may result in criminal prosecution. This does not apply to public safety officers who are in possession of an illegal or controlled drug or substance while acting in the line of duty.
3. It is not permitted for an employee to be under the influence of controlled drugs or substances or alcohol on the job, except as provided for in this Section 29.08.04130. The use of controlled drugs or substances prescribed by a licensed physician is not prohibited, but employees in positions where side effects of the prescribed medication could affect performance and safety on the job are required to make such use known to their immediate supervisor. Any employee misusing a prescription drug may be disciplined up to and including termination.
4. The illegal use, sale, and possession of alcohol, controlled drugs or substances while off duty and off City premises which results in a criminal conviction is unacceptable. They may affect the job performance and the confidence of the public in the City's ability to meet its responsibilities. Such off-the-job conduct may be proper cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination.
23.2 Testing for Drugs or Alcohol
Alcohol/Controlled Substance Testing Program for Employees with Commercial Driver's Licenses (CDL) in Safety Sensitive Positions. In an effort to prevent injuries and deaths due to drug or alcohol-impaired drivers operating commercial vehicles, the United State Congress enacted the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act). This federal law mandates drug and alcohol testing for certain classes of transportation employees.
Department of Transportation (DOT) defines the following as safety sensitive positions:
 A city employee who operates a vehicle that is designed to transport 15 passengers or more;
 A city employee who operates a vehicle that weighs 26,001 pounds or more singular or articulated (tractor trailer) and the trailer weight is in excess of 10,000 pounds or more; or
 A city employee who operates a vehicle of any size vehicles requiring placards for hazardous materials (hazmat).
Any employee of the city of Dickinson, who, as a requirement of the job, operates a vehicle classified as commercial and has a commercial drivers license, is considered to be in a safety-sensitive position and is subject to the Department of Transportation 49 CFR part 40 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations (regulations). Provisions for disciplinary actions are based on the independent authority of the City.
This portion of the Human Resources Manual covers only employees subject to the regulations and describes City implementation of the regulations. Employees in the safety sensitive positions listed below are subject to the controlled substance requirements of the regulations and to this policy at all times when on duty, regardless of the task they are performing. Employees subject to alcohol testing requirements will be subject to testing while on duty or just prior to, just after, or when performing safety-sensitive functions are:
 Equipment Operators operating commercial vehicles
Page 466 of 878
 Engineering Technicians operating commercial vehicles
 Other employees operating commercial vehicles
 Temporary and seasonal employees operating commercial vehicles.
 All safety sensitive employees are subject to controlled substance testing while on or off duty.
Designated employer representative (DER) is an individual identified by the employer as able to receive communications and test results from service agents and who is authorized to take immediate actions to remove employees from safety-sensitive duties and to make required decisions in the testing and evaluation processes. The individual must be an employee of the City.
23.3 Alcohol Prohibition Employees must:
 Test when required.
 Not use alcohol, in any form, on the job (including mouthwash or cough syrup containing alcohol).
 Not have even one drink fewer than four hours before work duties begin.
 Not work under the influence of alcohol
 Not remain on duty with a confirmed breath-and/or saliva alcohol concentration of .02 or greater.
 Not use alcohol within eight hours after an accident or until undergoing a post-accident alcohol test.
The regulations require that covered employees be available to be tested for alcohol while on duty just prior to, just after, or while performing a safety-sensitive function. Employees who refuse to be tested or to cooperate in testing, or who attempt to alter test results, are subject to disciplinary procedures, which may include termination.
23.4 Controlled-Substance Prohibition Employees must:
 Test when required.
 Not use illegal controlled substances.
 Not use prescription drugs containing controlled substances contrary to a physicians instructions.
 Notify their supervisor if using a prescription containing a controlled substance.
The safety sensitive employee must, upon request also provide documentation that use of the drug does not adversely affect the safety sensitive employee's ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle as described in the regulations.
Employees who refuse to be tested or to cooperate in testing, or who attempt to alter test results, are subject to immediate removal from safety sensitive function and are subject to disciplinary procedures which may include termination.
No employee shall report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety sensitive functions when the employee uses any controlled substance, except when the use is pursuant to the instructions of a licensed medical practitioner, who has advised the employee that the substance will not adversely affect the employee's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.
23.5 Alcohol and Controlled-Substance Tests
All applicants and employees who undergo City mandated tests will be notified if the test result is positive by the testing contractor before the City's designated reporting person is notified.
The City or a contractor of the City performing the tests will follow specific
Page 467 of 878
procedures if an alcohol-test result is .02 or greater. The procedures are required by federal guidelines and are intended to make sure that the test result is .02 or greater.
Tests required by the City, except for pre-employment tests and return-to duty tests, are considered a duty assignment. Time for travel and time spent in providing the specimen at the collection site will be with pay.
Any action which indicates a refusal to test will result in the employee being terminated.
23.6 Definition of Positive Alcohol or Controlled-Substance Test
Alcohol concentration is defined by the Federal Department of Transportation Regulations. Alcohol tests will be considered positive if the breath and/or saliva test indicates an alcohol presence of .04 or greater. If the test results are positive, the employee and supervisor will be notified before the employee leaves the test site.
If an alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration of at least .02, but less than .04, the test is considered negative, but the safety sensitive employee will be taken out of service for 24 hours. A controlled substance drug test will be considered positive if a controlled substance for which no legitimate explanation is determined by the Medical Review Officer (MRO) is found in the test specimen.
23.7 Testing Responsibilities in Alcohol and Controlled-Substance Testing
If the initial alcohol test results are .02 or greater, the City or a contractor of the City performing the tests will wait 15 minutes and then issue a confirmation test. During the 15-minute waiting period before the confirmation test, the employee will be given a set of instructions (for example, no eating or drinking) that must be followed. If the employee does not follow these instructions, it may be considered an attempt to alter the test results. The confirmation test result is used for disciplinary purposes. Controlled-substance tests must use proper laboratory procedures.
If a test is confirmed positive, it will be reviewed by the physician serving as the testing vendors MRO. The MRO will follow specific procedures required by the federal guidelines. These procedures are intended to make sure that the test result is a true positive. The MRO will call the employee who has tested positive, discuss what might have caused the test result to be positive before calling the City's contact person, and make sure of the result before notifying the City. If the test remains positive, the employee may request, at his/her expense, that a second independent analysis be performed on the untested portion of the sample. This is considered a split test.
23.8 Post-accident Tests
Drivers are responsible for notifying the City of any vehicle accident while on duty. In an accident resulting in a death, the City driver(s) involved must undergo post-accident testing. In an accident which does not result in a death, but in which the City driver is cited for a moving traffic violation that either resulted in vehicles involved in the accident being towed from the scene or injuries as a result of the accident being treated away from the scene, the driver must undergo post-accident drug and alcohol testing.
Employees must be tested for controlled substances within 32 hours after all accidents resulting in a death or where the driver is cited for a moving violation if the accident resulted in injuries needing to be treated away from the scene or vehicles involved in the accident are required to be towed from the scene. If the controlled-substance test is not administered within 32 hours, no test will be given, and the manager must file and maintain records stating the reason for the delay and the lack of testing.
Page 468 of 878
Employees must be tested for alcohol within two hours of the accident. If the alcohol test is not administered within two hours, the manager must file and maintain records stating why. Once documented, the City has six additional hours to perform the test. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight hours of the accident, no test will be given, and the manager must file and maintain records stating the reason for the delay and lack of testing. Employees must remain at work, but must not perform safety-sensitive functions, until the post-accident alcohol test is administered or eight hours since the accident have lapsed, or an unimpaired adult agrees to pick the employee up from work and transport that employee home.
23.9 Types of Required Drug Testing
23.9.1 Pre-Employment Tests
New employees will be hired for safety-sensitive positions on the condition of a negative controlled substances test (administered after being chosen but before being hired) and after obtaining a controlled substances and alcohol testing record from previous employers that shows the employee has been in a random drug and alcohol program for the past 12 months and/or has been selected over the last six months in the time period between the end of their work performance at the previous job and application for the city's position has not exceeded 30 days. City job announcements will indicate if the position is safety-sensitive and requires pre-employment drug testing.
23.9.2 Random Testing
A minimum number of random alcohol tests, equal to 10 percent of the average number of City safety sensitive employees covered under the regulations will be conducted each year. The City or a contractor of the City performing the tests will select safety sensitive employees using a computerized random-selection program or other random selection method approved by the City. Safety sensitive employees selected will be tested prior to going on duty, while performing safety sensitive functions or just after.
A minimum number of random controlled-substance tests equal to 50 percent of the average number of safety sensitive employees, will be performed each year. Tests may be performed at any time the safety sensitive employee is on or off duty, regardless of the duties being performed at the time of testing. Safety sensitive employees may potentially be tested at any time, even if there is a recent previous test. Once a safety sensitive employee is notified of the testing, he or she must report immediately to the testing site.
23.9.3 Reasonable Suspicion Tests
A safety sensitive employee must undergo alcohol or controlled substance testing when any supervisor who has received the mandatory reasonable suspicion training has reason to believe that the safety sensitive employee has used alcohol or controlled substances in violation of the regulations. An alcohol test may be administered just prior, just after, or while the safety sensitive employee is performing a safety-sensitive function.
All supervisors will be given adequate training to make judgments about a reasonable suspicion of controlled substance or alcohol use. The supervisors judgment must be based on specific observations relating to appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors, including indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects
Page 469 of 878
of alcohol and/or controlled substances. The supervisor must document the observations fully notifying the employee that testing is required. Supervisors will be trained regarding physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances.
All employees, including non-supervisory employees, may call their supervisor, the manager or the City Administrator to ask any questions about the program, or to state their suspicions about another employee, including a supervisor. The employee who calls must give his/her name, but the names will be kept confidential to the extent possible under the open records law of North Dakota.
23.9.4 Return-To-Duty Tests
If any test result is positive and the course of treatment recommended by a substance abuse professional (SAP) with the City EAP has been completed, the safety sensitive employee must submit to return-to-duty alcohol or controlled substance tests prior to resuming duties. The return-to-duty alcohol test must indicate a breath-alcohol concentration of less than .02. Controlled-substance test results must be negative.
The employee will be required to pay for the return-to-duty test.
23.9.5 Follow-up Tests
Unannounced follow-up tests are required for a minimum of six months or as high as 60 months for any safety sensitive employee who, after a positive test result, is determined by a SAP to need help with alcohol or controlled-substance abuse. The City shall pay for the SAP and follow up test(s).

23.10 Out-of-Service Request
All safety sensitive employees subject to call for emergency duties, who are not actually listed on-call, who have had one or more drink(s) in the four hours prior to an emergency call-out, or suspects that he/she may have a breath-alcohol concentration of 0.02 or above, must take him/herself out of service. No disciplinary measures will be taken when the safety sensitive employee, who is not listed as on-call requests to take him/herself out of service for an emergency call-out.
23.11 Required Records and Records Retention
The City, or a contractor of the City performing the tests under this section, will maintain necessary records as required by federal DOT regulations either at City Hall or the primary contractors place of business. In all cases, information must be available at the City within 24 hours if requested by officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation responsible for the testing program.
23.12 City Requirements to Inquire With Previous Employers
The City must inquire with previous employers before hiring someone to fill a safety-sensitive position. Prior to being hired by the City, applicants must sign a release of information allowing the City to inquire with previous employers about the applicants controlled substance and alcohol testing history during the previous three years. Information that may be requested includes:
 Previous test dates.
 Positive test results.
 Refusals to test.
 Evaluation and rehabilitation results.
23.13 Release of Information to Prospective Employers
All testing information about individual employees is confidential and is not in the public domain. Such information may not be released except as required by law or expressly authorized by 49 CFR 382.405.
Page 471 of 878
If requested in writing and proper release of information is provided, the City will disclose the following information to any potential future employees:
 Alcohol tests with a result of 0.04 or higher alcohol concentration;
 Verified positive drug tests;
 Refusals to be tested (including verified adulterated or substituted drug test results);
 Other violation of DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations;
Documentation of the employee's successful completion of DOT return-to-duty requirements (including follow-up tests).
23.14 Non DOT Safety Sensitive Employees
The City may request that the employee undergo drug and alcohol testing if there is a "reasonable suspicion" that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol during work hours. "Reasonable suspicion" means an articulated belief based on specific facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts that an employee is under the influence of controlled substances or alcohol. Supervisors who have received reasonable suspicion training acknowledge that because non-DOT safety sensitive employees have a greater right to privacy than DOT safety sensitive employees, the supervisor must observe significant indicators prior to ordering testing. Circumstances which constitute a basis for determining reasonable suspicion may include, but are not limited to:
 A pattern of abnormal or erratic behavior which is so unusual that it warrants summoning another employee, a supervisor, a police officer or other individual for assistance.
 Information provided by a reliable and credible source with personal knowledge.
 Direct observation of drug or alcohol use.
 Presence of the physical symptoms of drug or alcohol use; (i.e. glossy or blood-shot eyes, alcohol odor on breath, slurred speech, poor coordination and/or reflexes). (Code 1637 § 1)
23.15 Pre-Employment Drug Testing
The City may at its discretion implement a pre-employment drug testing program for all classifications of employees. Upon implementation all employees will be required to pass a pre-employment drug test as a condition of employment.
23.16 Possession of substances in violation of the City's drug and alcohol policy.
The employee, where "reasonable suspicion" exists, may be asked to submit to a breath and/or saliva alcohol testing by the City's drug and alcohol contractor. Controlled substance urine and/or hair follicle testing will be conducted by the City's drug and alcohol contractor at the City's expense. Any action which indicates a refusal to test will result in the employee being terminated. A positive result from the controlled substance and/or alcohol test confirming the reasonable suspicion will result in disciplinary action up to termination.
The supervisor who has received reasonable suspicion training is required to document in writing, the specific facts, symptoms, or observations which led to the reasonable suspicion. The City Administrator shall place this documentation in the employee's medical personnel file only if confirmed by the controlled substance and/or alcohol test.
All information from an employee's controlled substance and/or alcohol test is
Page 472 of 878
confidential, and only the City's DER will be informed of the test results. Disclosure of test results to any other person, agency, or organization is prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee.
23.17 Vehicle Accidents
Drivers are responsible for notifying their supervisor of any vehicle accident while on duty. In an accident resulting in a death, all City drivers involved must undergo post-accident testing. In an accident which does not result in a death, but in which the City driver is cited for a moving traffic violation that either resulted in vehicles involved in the accident being towed from the scene or injuries as a result of the accident being treated away from the scene, the driver must undergo post-accident drug and alcohol testing.
Employees must be tested for controlled substances within 32 hours after all accidents resulting in a death or where the driver is cited for a moving violation if the accident resulted in injuries needing to be treated away from the scene or vehicles involved in the accident are required to be towed from the scene. If the controlled-substance test is not administered within 32 hours, no test will be given, and the manager must file and maintain records stating the reason for the delay and the lack of testing. Employees must be tested for alcohol within two hours of the accident. If the alcohol test is not administered within two hours, the manager must file and maintain records stating why. Once documented, the City has six additional hours to perform the test. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight hours of the accident, no test will be given, and the manager must file and maintain records stating the reason for the delay and lack of testing. Employees must remain at work, but must not perform safety-sensitive functions, unless the post-accident alcohol test is administered or eight hours since the accident has lapsed, or an unimpaired adult agrees to pick the employee up from work and transport that employee home.
23.18 Return to Duty Testing and Follow Up Tests
If any test result is positive and the course of treatment recommended by a substance abuse professional (SAP) with the City EAP has been completed, the employee must submit to return-to-duty alcohol or controlled substance tests prior to resuming duties. The return-to-duty alcohol test must indicate a breath alcohol concentration of less than .02. Controlled-substance test results must be negative. The employee will be required to pay for the return-to-duty test. Unannounced follow-up tests are required for a minimum of six months or as high as 60 months for any employee who, after a positive test result, is determined by a SAP to need help with alcohol or controlled-substance abuse. The City shall pay for the SAP and follow up test(s).
23.19 Controlled Substances to be Tested
The following drug groups were selected based on the ability of each drug to adversely affect physical/mental performance. All are controlled substances under state and federal law.
 Alcohol
 Amphetamines, Methamphetamines
 Cocaine
 Opiates
 Marijuana
23.20 Employee Responsibilities

(Code 1958 § 9-28; Ord. No. 454 § 2; Ord. No. 1090 § 2; Ord. No. 1163 § 5; Ord. No. 1347 §1 Code 1637 § 1)
Section 29.08.04140 Americans With Disabilities Act Employment Grievance Procedure
ADA Employment Grievance Procedure
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides comprehensive civil rights protection to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, state and local government services and programs, and telecommunications. Title II of the ADA states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified disabled employee or prospective employee shall, solely by reason of such disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination" in programs or activities sponsored by a public entity.
The City of Dickinson has adopted this grievance procedure to provide prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the U.S. Department of Justice regulations implementing Title II of the ADA. The language included here is drawn from the ADA policy adopted by the City in September, 1994. The City of Dickinson has designated its Human Resources Coordinator as its ADA Coordinator.
Any employee or prospective employee who believes that (s)he or a specific class of individuals with disabilities has been subjected to unlawful discrimination on the basis of that disability by the City of Dickinson may, by himself or herself or by any authorized representative, file a complaint. Complaints should be addressed to: ADA Coordinator, City of Dickinson, 99 2nd St. E, Dickinson, ND 58601, (701) 456-7801, who has been designated to coordinate ADA compliance efforts.
A complaint must be submitted in writing to the City ADA Coordinator and contain: the name and address of the individual or representative filing the complaint, a description of the alleged discriminatory action in sufficient detail to inform the entity of the nature and date of the alleged violation, and be signed by the complainant or authorized representative. Complaints filed on behalf of third parties must describe or identify the alleged victims of the discrimination.
A decision by the ADA Coordinator regarding the complaint will be made within ten (10) working days after its receipt. The ADA Coordinator will submit written notice of the decision to the complainant. If the complaint is not resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant by the ADA Coordinator, the complainant may request the complaint be forwarded to the ADA Compliance Committee. The Committee will hear the complaint at a public meeting, after adequate notice is given. The Committee will issue a written decision within thirty (30) after receiving the complaint. If the complaint cannot be resolved to the complainants satisfaction by the Committee, the complaint may be heard by the City Commission upon written request by the complainant.
The City Commission will consider the complaint at any regular or special meeting, after adequate public notice is given. A written determination by the City Commission will be rendered within thirty (30) days after receipt of the complaint. The decision of the City Commission is a final administrative decision.
As an alternative to the above, complaints regarding testing, selection, promotion,
Page 475 of 878
separation, and other employment policies or working conditions may be submitted to the Civil Service Commission in lieu of the Dickinson City Commission. In such an instance, the Commission shall consider the complaint during a regular or special meeting. A written decision by the Commission must be rendered within thirty (30) days after receipt of the complaint. The decision of the Civil Service Commission is a final administrative decision.
Files and records of all complaints filed shall be maintained regarding each level of the grievance process.
Nothing in this grievance procedure shall be construed as preventing an individual from pursuit of other remedies including filing the complaint with any federal agency (s)he believes is appropriate or with the U.S. Department of Justice. This procedure also does not preclude the individual's right to file a lawsuit in federal district court. (Code 1637 § 1)

[ii] Mortality Table: 1983 IAM with six year setback
[iii] Notwithstanding any other Plan provisions to the contrary, effective for any distribution with an annuity starting date on or after January 1, 2008, the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Code Section 415(b)(2)(B), (C) or (D) and the applicable mortality table used for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Code Section 417(e) is the applicable mortality table within the meaning of Code Section 417(e)(3)(B). For any distribution with an annuity starting date on or after the effective date of this Section and before the adoption date of this Section, if application of the amendment as of the annuity starting date would have caused a reduction in the amount of any distribution, such reduction is not reflected in any payment made before the adoption date of this section. However, the amount of any such reduction that is required under Code Section 415(b)(2) must be reflected actuarially over any remaining payments to the Participant. (Ord. No. 1539 § 4)
1.2 Beneficiary means the person who, under this Plan becomes entitled to receive a Participant's interest upon the Participant's death.
1.3 Board of Trustees means the Board designated by the Plan in Article VII whose duties and responsibilities are specified in this Plan.

Cost-of-living adjustment. The $200,000 limit on annual compensation in the preceding paragraph shall be adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year.
If Compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a Participant's benefits for the current Plan Year, the Compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable Annual Compensation Limit in effect for that prior period. For this purpose, in determining benefits in Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1989 and before January 1, 1996, the Annual Compensation Limit in effect for determination periods beginning before that date is $200,000. For this purpose, in determining benefits in Plan Years beginning after January 1, 1996, the Annual Compensation Limit in effect for determination periods beginning before that date is $150,000 as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B).

(1) Not §417(e)(3) Forms. If the benefit is paid in a form to which Code Section 417(e)(3) does not apply (e.g., lifetime annuity), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit is the greater of
(A) the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Participant under the Plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit that is payable to the Participant, or
(B) the annual amount of straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit that is payable to the Participant, computed using a five percent (5%) interest and the applicable mortality table described in Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Regulations for that annuity starting date.
(2) §417(e)(3) Forms. If the benefit is paid in a form to which Code Section 417(e)(3) does apply (e.g., lump sum), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit is the greatest of:
(A) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit that is payable to the Participant, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the Plan for determining the amount of that form of benefit, or
(B) the annual amount of straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit that is payable to the Participant, computed using a five and one half percent (5.5%) interest and the applicable mortality table described in Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Regulations for that annuity starting date, or

The new amount will apply to limitation years ending within such calendar year. The new amounts shall also apply to a participant who has had a severance from employment or an annuity starting date.
[g] Participation Reduction. If a Participant has less than ten (10) Years of Participation in the plan, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limit otherwise defined and adjusted above shall be reduced to an amount equal to One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) as otherwise defined and adjusted above multiplied by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which is the number of Years (and part thereof) of Participation (not less than one), and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10).

If these two conditions are met, the portion of a Year of Participation credited to the Participant shall equal the amount of benefit accrual service credited to the Participant for that accrual computation period. A Participant who is permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) for an accrual computation period shall receive a Year of Participation with respect to that period. In addition, for a Participant to receive a Year of Participation (or part thereof) for an accrual computation period, the Plan must be established no later than the last day of such accrual computation period. In no event will more than one Year of Participation be credited for any 12-month period.

This section applies regardless of whether any Participant is or has ever been a Participant in another qualified plan maintained by the City. The Annual Benefit otherwise payable to a Participant at any time will not exceed the maximum Permissible Amount. If the benefit of the Participant would otherwise accrue in a Limitation year would produce an Annual Benefit in excess of the Maximum Permissible Amount, the rate of accrual will be reduced so that the Annual Benefit
Page 504 of 878
will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. If a Participant has made nondeductible Participant contributions under the Plan, the amount of those contributions is treated as an Annual Addition to a qualified defined contribution plan, for purposes of this Article.

This section applies if any Participant is covered, or has been covered, by another qualified plan, which provides an Annual Addition and which is maintained by the City.

[i] If a retired Participant has elected the normal form of benefit upon retirement, a monthly benefit shall be paid to the Surviving Spouse for life in an amount equal to 2/3 of the Participant's accrued benefit as of the date of death but such benefit shall not be less than $50 per month.
[ii] If a retired Participant has elected the optional form of benefit of the Actuarial
Equivalent 100 percent for both Participant and Surviving Spouse at retirement, a monthly benefit will be paid to the Surviving Spouse of 100% of the benefit payable continuing for the remaining life of the survivor.
[iii] A monthly benefit will be paid to the Surviving Spouse of an active Employee for life in an amount equal to the monthly benefit that would have been paid to the Surviving Spouse if the Participant had retired the day before his death with actuarially equivalent benefits payable in the form of an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's spouse with 100% of the benefit payable during their joint lives continuing for the remaining life of the survivor. Alternatively, a Surviving Spouse of an active Employee who dies prior to August 1, 2010 may elect in writing within 90 days after the Participant's death to have the benefit payable under this subsection [iii] payable in an actuarially equivalent single sum payment.

[b] Minimum Benefit: The benefits paid under this Section 6.6 to a Participant's Surviving Spouse and Children will not be less than the total amount of the Participant's Employee Contributions plus Earnings, reduced by any benefits paid to the Participant under Section 6.2 or Section 6.5. Any remainder payable under this subsection will be paid to the estate of the Participant. (Ord. No. 1265 §1; Ord. No. 1279 § ; Ord. No. 1384 §3 & 7 & 8)
Section 32.08.670 Designation of Beneficiary.
Each Participant will designate a Beneficiary to receive any aggregate minimum benefits payable under section 6.8 upon his death on the form prescribed by and delivered to the Board of Trustees. The Participant will have the right to change or revoke a designation at any time by filing a new designation or notice of revocation with the Board of Trustees.
If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary before his death, or if no Designated Beneficiary survives the Participant, the Board of Trustees will direct the Trustee to pay any benefit first to his Surviving Spouse, if any, or if none, then to his personal representative. If no personal representative has been appointed, and if the benefit does not exceed the minimum amount for which an estate or inheritance tax release or appointment of a personal representative is required under applicable state law the Board of Trustees may direct the Trustee to pay the benefit to such person as may be entitled to it under the laws of the state in which the Participant was domiciled at the date of his death. The Board of Trustees may require such proof of right or identity as he may deem necessary. If the benefit exceeds the minimum amount for which an estate or inheritance tax release or appointment of a personal representative is required under applicable state law, the Board of Trustees may direct the Trustee to hold the benefits in a segregated account until such time as the Trustee is notified that a personnel representative has been appointed. (Ord. No. 1265 §1.)
Section 32.08.680 Minimum Aggregate Benefits.
In no event shall the total benefits payable under this Plan in respect to a given Participant be less than the total contributions made by such Participant plus Earnings.

anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any payments or benefits that he may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under this Plan, except the right to designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries.
[b] Participant Or Beneficiary Whose Whereabouts Are Unknown: In the case of any Participant or Beneficiary whose whereabouts are unknown, the Board of Trustees will notify the Participant or Beneficiary at his last known address by certified mail with return receipt requested advising him of his right to a pending distribution.

If a claim for forfeited Accrued Benefits is subsequently made by the Participant or Beneficiary, the amount forfeited, unadjusted for earnings or interest, will be restored.
[c] Minors or Persons of Unsound Mind. If the person designated to receive payments is a minor or a person of unsound mind, whether formally so adjudicated or not, the Trustee, upon receipt of instructions from the Board of Trustees, may make payment to the person's legal representative or legal guardian, and the receipt by any such person will be a full and complete discharge of the Plan for any sums paid.
[d] Suspension of Benefit Payments: If a retired Participant is re-employed by the City for the performance of light duty, payment of benefits under this Plan will be suspended until the Participant terminates employment provided, however, that the President of the Board of City Commissioners may assign any Employee of the City, other than policemen, retired under the provisions of this Article, to the performance of light duties in the City.

Section 32.08.750 Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.
[a] Definitions:
[1] Alternate Payee means any Spouse, former Spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a Plan with respect to the Participant.
[2] Earliest Retirement Age means, for purposes of this section only, the earlier of [i] the date the Participant is entitled to a distribution under the Plan or [ii] the later of the date the Participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the Participant could begin receiving benefits under the Plan if the Participant separated from service.

To qualify, the domestic relations order must:
Page 515 of 878
[A] clearly state the name and last known mailing address of the Participant and the name and mailing address of each Alternative Payee covered by the order;
[B] clearly state the amount or percentage of the Participant's benefits to be paid by the Plan to each Alternate Payee, or the manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined;
[C] clearly state the number of payments or period to which the order applies;
[D] identify each Plan to which the order applies;
[E] not require the Plan to provide any type or form of benefits, or any option, not otherwise provided under the Plan;
[F] not require the Plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value); and
[G] not require the payment of benefits to an Alternate Payee that are required to be paid to another Alternate Payee under another order previously determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.
[b] Payment of Benefits Under A Qualified Domestic Relations Order: Section 6.10[a] will not apply to prevent payment of benefits to an Alternate Payee under the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. In the case of any distribution before a Participant has separated from service, a Qualified Domestic Relations Order will not fail to meet the requirements of subparagraph [E] above solely because the Order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee [A] on or after the date the Participant attains the Earliest Retirement Age, [B] as if the Participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under the Order, and [C] in any form in which benefits may be paid under the Plan to the Participant (other than in the form of a Qualified Joint and survivor Annuity with respect to the Alternate Payee and his subsequent spouse. A person who is an Alternate Payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order will be considered a Beneficiary under the Plan.
[c] Procedures: The Board of Trustees will establish reasonable procedures for determining the qualified status of a domestic relations order. The procedures:

[2] will provide that each person specified in a Domestic Relations Order as entitled to payment of Plan benefits will be notified of the procedures promptly upon receipt of the Order by the Plan; and
[3] will permit an Alternate Payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the Alternate Payee. Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of an order, the Board of Trustees will determine whether the order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order and notify the Participant and each Alternate Payee of the determination. During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is being determined, the Board of Trustees will segregate, in a separate account, any otherwise distributable amounts that would have been payable to the Alternate Payee during the period if the order had been determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. If, within 18 months the order is determined not to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order or the issue as to whether the order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is not resolved, then the Board of Trustees
Page 516 of 878
may pay the segregated amounts to the person or persons who would have been entitled to those amounts if there had been no order.

Notwithstanding any other Plan provisions to the contrary, effective for any distribution with an annuity starting date on or after January 1, 2008, the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Code Section 415(b)(2)(B), (C) or (D) and the applicable mortality table used for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Code Section 417(e) is the applicable mortality table within the meaning of Code Section 417(e)(3)(B). For any distribution with an annuity starting date on or after the effective date of this Section and before the adoption date of this Section, if application of the amendment as of the annuity starting date would have caused a reduction in the amount of any distribution, such reduction is not reflected in any payment made before the adoption date of this section. However, the amount of any such reduction that is required under Code Section 415(b)(2) must be reflected actuarially over any remaining payments to the Participant. (Ord. No. 1539 §10.)

The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year.

Effective January 1, 2002, and each January 1 thereafter, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limit shall be adjusted automatically for increases in the cost of living by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Code Section 415(d). The new amount will apply to limitation years ending within such calendar year. The new amounts shall also apply to a participant who has had a severance from employment or an annuity starting date.
[g] Participation Reduction. If a Participant has less than ten (10) Years of Participation in the plan, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limit otherwise defined and adjusted above shall be reduced to an amount equal to One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) as otherwise defined and adjusted above multiplied by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which is the number of Years (and part thereof) of Participation (not less than one), and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10).
[h] No Reduction for Certain Participants. Paragraph [e][3] shall not apply in the case of a qualified participant as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(H). For purposes of paragraph [e][3] only, qualified participant means a participant in the Plan with respect to when the Years of Service used to determine the amount of benefit under the Plan includes at least 15 years of service of the Participant as either [1] a full-time employee of a police or fire department or [2] as a member of the United States Armed Forces.
[i] Year of Participation. The Participant shall be credited with a Year of Participation (computed to fractional parts of a year) for each accrual computation period for which the following conditions are met: (1) The Participant is credited with a Year of Service, and (2) the Participant is included as a Participant under the eligibility provisions of the Plan for at least one day of the accrual computation period. If these two conditions are met, the portion of a Year of Participation credited to the Participant shall equal the amount of benefit accrual service credited to the Participant for that accrual computation period. A Participant who is permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) for an accrual computation period shall receive a Year of Participation with respect to that period. In addition, for a Participant to receive a Year of Participation (or part thereof) for an accrual computation period, the Plan must be established no later than the last day of such accrual computation
Page 534 of 878
period. In no event will more than one Year of Participation be credited for any 12-month period.
[j] Multiple Annuity Starting Dates. If a Participant is entitled to benefits under this plan and under defined benefit plans that commenced as of an earlier annuity starting date, the annual benefits due under all such plans must not exceed the maximum permissible benefit at all annuity starting dates.
[k] Effect on Participants. Benefit increases resulting from the increase in the limitations of section 415(b) of the Code will be provided only to active Participants who are credited with an hour of service on or after the first day of the first limitation year ending after December 31, 2001.

Section 32.12.520 Limitations on Benefits.
This section applies regardless of whether any Participant is or has ever been a Participant in another qualified plan maintained by the City. The Annual Benefit otherwise payable to a Participant at any time will not exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount. If the benefit of the Participant would otherwise accrue in a Limitation Year would produce an Annual Benefit in excess of the Maximum Permissible Amount, the rate of accrual will be reduced so that the Annual Benefit will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. If a Participant has made nondeductible Participant contributions under the Plan, the amount of those contributions is treated as an Annual Addition to a qualified defined contribution plan, for purposes of this Article. The limitation in this section is deemed satisfied if the Annual Benefit payable to a Participant is not more than $1,000 multiplied by the Participant s number of Years of Service or parts of Years of Service (not to exceed 10) with the City. (Ord. No. 1266, § 1.)

Page 535 of 878
[1] For each full Year and completed month of Service a Participant will be credited with a monthly benefit equal to one-twelfth of three and seven-tenths percent of his Total Basic Compensation applicable to the period; plus
[2] Any Benefit Accrued by the Participant under and transferred to the Plan from the City of Dickinson Pension Plan and Trust.
[c] Accrued Benefit of A Participant Retiring Before November 1, 1992: The accrued benefit of a Participant who retired before November 1, 1992 will be increased as of November 1, 1992 to a monthly benefit commencing at the later of November 1, 1992 or Normal Retirement Age and payable for the life of the Participant that is computed as follows:
[1] For each full Year and completed month of Service before April 1, 1969 a Participant will be credited with a monthly benefit equal to one-twelfth of one and eighty-five one hundredths percent of his basic salary rate effective January 1, 1986 or, if earlier, the date the Participant terminated employment; plus

[b] Normal Retirement: On the last day of the month in which a Participant attains his Normal Retirement Age, he may retire voluntarily or continue working subject to any mandatory retirement policy of the City otherwise permitted by law. Any Termination of Employment on or after the Participant attains Normal Retirement Age will be deemed to be a retirement. Until actual retirement a Participant may continue to participate in the Plan. Normal Retirement Benefit payments will begin as of the later of the Participant's Normal Retirement Age or the date the Employee retires but not later than the Required Beginning Date. There will be no actuarial adjustment for late commencement of payment for benefits commencing later than Normal Retirement Age.
[c] Early Retirement: An Employee who terminates employment with the City after completing at least 15 Years of Service may elect Early Retirement benefits. Payment of the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant's Accrued Benefit payable at Normal Retirement Age may commence as of the date of the Participant's Early Retirement.

[d] Disability: An Employee who terminates employment with the City because of Total and Permanent Disability before attaining Early or Normal Retirement Age shall be paid Disability Retirement Benefits commencing as of the date of termination of employment.

Page 536 of 878
the commencement of payment before Normal Retirement Age and without accrual of any additional benefit or Years of Service after the date of disability retirement but shall not be less than $50 per month. Any Disability Retirement Benefit payable under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of any payment from the Workers Compensation Bureau made to the Employee because of the Total and Permanent Disability.
If the benefits received from the Workers Compensation Bureau exceed the Benefit the Employee would be entitled to under the Plan, no pension shall be paid from the Plan to the Employee during the time the Workers Compensation payments are being made. If settlement of State Workers Compensation payment shall be in a lump sum, such sum shall be apportioned in accordance with the determination of the State Workers Compensation Bureau over a period of years for purposes of the offset against Plan benefits.
Payment of Disability Retirement Benefits will cease upon determination by the Board of Trustees that the Total and Permanent Disability has terminated. Any Normal or Early Retirement benefits that subsequently become payable will be reduced by the actuarial value of the Disability Retirement Benefit actually paid.
[e] Required Beginning Date. The Required Beginning Date is the April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which occurs the later of [1] the date the Participant attains age 70 1/2, or [2] the date the Participant retires from employment with the Employer.
[f] Minimum Benefit: The benefits paid under this Section 6.2 will not in any event be less than the total amount of the Participant's Employee contributions plus Earnings. (Ord. No. 1266, § 1.)

Payments will not be subject to the claim of any creditor of a Participant, nor may payments be taken in execution by attachment or garnishment or by any other legal or equitable proceedings. No person will have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any payments or benefits that he may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under this Plan, except the right to designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries.
[b] Participant Or Beneficiary Whose Whereabouts Are Unknown: In the case of any Participant or Beneficiary whose whereabouts are unknown, the Board of Trustees will notify the Participant or Beneficiary at his last known address by certified mail with return receipt requested advising him of his right to a pending distribution.

direct the Trustee to forfeit the Accrued Benefit. If a claim for forfeited Accrued Benefits is subsequently made by the Participant or Beneficiary, the amount forfeited, unadjusted for earnings or interest, will be restored.
[c] Minors or Persons of Unsound Mind. If the person designated to receive payments is a minor or a person of unsound mind, whether formally so adjudicated or not, the Trustee, upon receipt of instructions from the Board of Trustees, may make payment to the person's legal representative or legal guardian, and the receipt by any such person will be a full and complete discharge of the Plan for any sums paid.

[1] Alternate Payee means any Spouse, former Spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a Plan with respect to the Participant.
[2] Earliest Retirement Age means, for purposes of this section only, the earlier of [i] the date the Participant is entitled to a distribution under the Plan or [ii] the later of the date the Participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the Participant could begin receiving benefits under the Plan if the Participant separated from service.
[3] Qualified Domestic Relations Order means an order that creates or recognizes the existence of an Alternate Payee's right to, or assigns to an Alternate Payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits otherwise payable to a Participant under the Plan. A Qualified Domestic Relations Order includes any judgement, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) that relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a Spouse, Former Spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant, and is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law). To qualify, the domestic relations order must:
[A] clearly state the name and last known mailing address of the Participant and the name and mailing address of each Alternative Payee covered by the order;
[B] clearly state the amount or percentage of the Participant's benefits to be paid by the Plan to each Alternate Payee, or the manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined;
[C] clearly state the number of payments or period to which the order applies;
[D] identify each Plan to which the order applies;
Page 545 of 878
[E] not require the Plan to provide any type or form of benefits, or any option, not otherwise provided under the Plan;
[F] not require the Plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value); and
[G] not require the payment of benefits to an Alternate Payee that are required to be paid to another Alternate Payee under another order previously determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.
[b] Payment of Benefits Under A Qualified Domestic Relations Order: Section 6.10[a] will not apply to prevent payment of benefits to an Alternate Payee under the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. In the case of any distribution before a Participant has separated from service, a Qualified Domestic Relations Order will not fail to meet the requirements of subparagraph [E] above solely because the Order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee [A] on or after the date the Participant attains the Earliest Retirement Age, [B] as if the Participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under the order, and [C] in any form in which benefits may be paid under the Plan to the Participant (other than in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity with respect to the Alternate Payee and his subsequent spouse). A person who is an Alternate Payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order will be considered a Beneficiary under the Plan.
[c] Procedures: The Board of Trustees will establish reasonable procedures for determining the qualified status of a domestic relations order. The procedures:
[1] will be in writing;
[2] will provide that each person specified in a Domestic Relations Order as entitled to payment of Plan benefits will be notified of the procedures promptly upon receipt of the Order by the Plan; and
[3] will permit an Alternate Payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the Alternate Payee. Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of an order, the Board of Trustees will determine whether the order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order and notify the Participant and each Alternate Payee of the determination. During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a Qualified Domestic Relations order is being determined, the Board of Trustees will segregate, in a separate account, any otherwise distributable amounts that would have been payable to the Alternate Payee during the period if the order had been determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. If, within 18 months the order is determined not to be a Qualified Domestic Relations order or the issue as to whether the order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is not resolved, then the Board of Trustees may pay the segregated amounts to the person or persons who would have been entitled to those amounts if there had been no order. If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with the fiduciary responsibility provisions of the Plan, then the Plan's obligation to the Participant and each Alternate Payee is discharged to the extent of any payment made. (Ord. No. 1266, § 1.)
Section 32.12.810 Investment of Plan Assets.
The duty of the Trustee is to hold in trust the funds it receives. The Trustee in accordance with the instructions of the Board of Trustees, will have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the Plan and to manage, invest, and reinvest the

(Ord. No. 1266, § 1.)
Section 32.12.920 Termination of Plan and Trust.
The City expects to continue this Plan and Trust indefinitely, but the continuance of the Plan and Trust is not assumed as a contractual obligation by the City and the right is reserved to the City to terminate this Plan and Trust in whole or part at any time.

Section 32.16.180 Required Distributions
[a] The Required Beginning Date is the April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which occurs the later of (1) the date the Participant attains age 70-1/2, or (2) the date the Participant retires from employment with the City.
[b] All distributions required under this section will be determined and made in accordance with the Regulations under Code Section 401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). Effective with respect to distributions made on or after January 1, 2003 and prior to January 1, 2005, all required distributions under this Section were determined in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9). Effective with respect to distributions made on or after January 1, 2005, all distributions required under this section will be made in accordance with the final Regulations under Code Section 401(a)(9) issued on April 17, 2002 and June 15, 2004, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary.
[c] The vested Accrued Benefits of a Member must be distributed or begin to be distributed no later than the Members Required Beginning Date.
[d] As of the first Distribution Calendar Year, distributions shall be made in the form of an annuity for the life of the Member.
[e] Payments under the annuity must satisfy the following requirements:
(1) the annuity distributions must be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year:
(2) the distribution period must be over a Life described in Section 401(a) (9) (A) (ii); and
(3) payments must either be non-increasing or increase only to provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the Members death; or because of an increase in benefits under the Plan.
[f] The following rules shall apply to any distribution with an annuity starting date prior to January 1, 2005. The Life Expectancy is calculated using the attained age of the Member (or Designated Beneficiary) as of the Members (or Designated Beneficiary's) birthday in the applicable calendar year. The applicable calendar year will be the first distribution calendar year. If annuity payments commence before the Required Beginning Date, the applicable calendar year is the year such payments commence. Life Expectancy and Joint and Last Survivor Expectancy are computed by use of the expected return multiples in Tables V and VI of Section 1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations.
The following rules shall apply to any distribution with an annuity starting date on or after January 1, 2005. Unless the Members spouse is the sole Designated Beneficiary, the period certain for the single life annuity with 120 payments guaranteed commencing during the Members lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Member under the Uniform Table set forth in Section 1.401(a) (9) -9, Q&A-2 of the Regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the calendar year in which the Member reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution period for the Member is the distribution period for age seventy (70) under the Uniform Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A-2 of the Regulations plus the excess of seventy (70) over the age of the Member as of the Members birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date If the
Page 557 of 878
Members spouse is the Members sole Designated Beneficiary, the period certain for the single life annuity with 120 payments guaranteed may not exceed the longer of the Members applicable distribution period (determined as described in the preceding sentence) or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Member and the Members spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A-3 of the Regulations using the Members and Spouses attained ages as of the Members and Spouses birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.
[g] If a Member dies after distribution of the Members interest begins in the form of an annuity meeting the requirements of this section, the remaining portion of the Members interest (if any) will continue to be distributed over the remaining period over which distributions commenced.
[h] If a Member dies before distributions begin, the benefit provided to the Members surviving spouse or surviving children pursuant to Section 32.16.150 shall begin by the December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died. (Ord No. 1375 §5)

This actuarial equivalent straight life annuity shall be determined under the following rules.
(1) Not §417(e)(3) Forms. If the benefit is paid in a form to which Code Section 417(e)(3) does not apply (e.g., lifetime annuity), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit is the greater of
(A) the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Member under the Plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit that is payable to the Member, or
(B) the annual amount of straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit that is payable to the Member, computed using a five percent (5%) interest and the applicable mortality table described in Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Regulations for that annuity starting date.
(2) §417(e)(3) Forms. If the benefit is paid in a form to which Code Section 417(e)(3) does apply (e.g., lump sum), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit is the greatest of:
(A) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit that is payable to the Member, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the Plan for determining the amount of that form of benefit, or
Page 560 of 878
(B) the annual amount of straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit that is payable to the Member, computed using a five and one half percent (5.5%) interest and the applicable mortality table described in Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Regulations for that annuity starting date, or
(C) the annual amount of straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit that is payable to the Member, computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2), divided by 1.05.
(3) Excluded Contributions. The annual benefit does not include any benefits attributable to employee contributions, rollover contributions or the assets transferred from a qualified plan that was not maintained by a Controlled Group Member.
(4) Ancillary Benefits. No actuarial adjustment to the annual benefit is required for: (A) the value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity (to the extent such value exceeds the sum of the value of a straight life annuity beginning on the same date and the value of post-retirement death benefits that would be paid even if the annuity were not in the form of a joint and survivor annuity), or (B) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a pre-retirement disability benefit, a pre-retirement death benefit or a post-retirement medical benefit), or (C) the value of post-retirement cost of living increases made in accordance with regulations under the Code.

(2) Early Commencement. If the annual benefit commences before age sixty-two (62) years and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) years and the age of benefit commencement, the maximum permissible benefit may not exceed the actuarial equivalent of a One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62) years.
If the annual benefit commences before age sixty-two (62) years and the Plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the maximum permissible benefit may not exceed the lesser of:

Page 563 of 878
the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Code Section 415(d). The new amount will apply to limitation years ending within such calendar year. The new amounts shall also apply to a Member who has had a severance from employment or an annuity starting date.
[g] Participation Reduction. If a Member has less than ten (10) Years of Participation in the plan, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limit otherwise defined and adjusted above shall be reduced to an amount equal to One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) as otherwise defined and adjusted above multiplied by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which is the number of Years (and part thereof) of Participation (not less than one), and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10).

A Member who is permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) for an accrual computation period shall receive a Year of Participation with respect to that period. In addition, for a Member to receive a Year of Participation (or part thereof) for an accrual computation period, the Plan must be established no later than the last day of such accrual computation period. In no event will more than one Year of Participation be credited for any 12-month period.
[j] Multiple Annuity Starting Dates. If a Member is entitled to benefits under this plan and under defined benefit plans that commenced as of an earlier annuity starting date, the annual benefits due under all such plans must not exceed the maximum permissible benefit at all annuity starting dates.
[k] Effect on Members. Benefit increases resulting from the increase in the limitations of Code Section 415(b) will be provided only to active Members who are credited with an hour of service on or after the first day of the first limitation year ending after December 31, 2001.

Section 34.010 Planning Commission The planning commission of the City of Dickinson is hereby authorized and empowered to review and approve or disapprove the subdivision and platting of land within the city limits of the City of Dickinson and its extra-territorial jurisdiction. Such extra-territorial jurisdiction shall include all of that area set forth in the Dickinson Municipal Code §39.01. (Ord No. 1541 § 1; Ord No. 1684 § 1)
Section 34.020 Purpose of Subdivision Regulations; Approval of Plats.
As each new subdivision of land in the City becomes a permanent unit in the basic structure of the expanding community, to which the community will be forced to adhere, the design and arrangement of such subdivisions must correlate to the unified scheme of community interests. In order to provide for the proper arrangement of streets in relation to other existing and planned streets, and to the master plan of the City of Dickinson; to provide for adequate and convenient open spaces, for recreation, for light and air; in order to avoid congestion of population; in order to provide for traffic, for utilities, for access of fire-fighting apparatus; in order to promote, preserve and enhance area natural resources; in order to provide for and improve the public health, safety and general welfare of the City of Dickinson, the following rules and regulations for the platting and subdivision of land within the City of Dickinson and adjacent territory have been adopted by the Planning Commission of the City of Dickinson, in accordance with the laws of the State of North Dakota and the ordinances of the City of Dickinson.
Every piece of land proposed for division within the City or within the City's extraterritorial area shall be prepared, presented for approval and recorded as described in this Chapter. This chapter applies to the platting of land into a single parcel, the subdivision of a lot or parcel of land into two or more lots, or other division of land for the purpose of sale or development, whether immediate
Page 601 of 878
or future, including the resubdivision or replatting of lots. No plat of a subdivision of land within the City of Dickinson or within the adjacent territory as subject to subdivision regulations of the City of Dickinson, shall be filed or recorded until it shall have been approved by the Planning Commission of the City of Dickinson and such approval entered in writing on the plat by the chairman and secretary of the City Planning Commission. Such subdivision plats must be prepared in accordance with provisions of Chapter 40-50 of the North Dakota Century Code. The filing of a plat of irregular description in accordance with Chapter 57-02-39 of the North Dakota Century Code does not meet the requirements of this Chapter. However, the division of land zoned Agricultural into parcels of ten (10) or more acres not involving any new street or easement of access shall be exempted from these regulations, except as to the rezoning of property. (Ord No. 1541 § 1; Ord No. 1684 § 1)

The planning and zoning commission shall then consider the recommendations of the park district regarding dedication of land, payment of funds in lieu thereof, whether the owners or developers of such PUD shall provide and maintain privately such parks, playgrounds or recreational areas which are proposed and any other reasonable recommendations which the park district may submit.
v. At the sole option of the Board of Commissioners of the Park District of City of Dickinson, the Park District may permit the owner or developer of residential property, or the applicant for approval of a plat or zoning designation, to make cash payment in lieu of the deeding to the Park District of seven percent (7%) of the total usable land area to be developed, exclusive of all other dedications, as provided in subsection (c). The Park District may further permit such owner or developer to make partial cash payment in lieu, in the event that the owner or developer conveys some land to the Park District for park purposes, but less than seven percent of the total land area to be developed exclusive of all other dedications. Such cash payment in lieu of land shall be intended to provide the Park District with a substantially equivalent economic benefit as if the Park District had received the land itself, as provided in subsection (c).

In the event of an application for replatting or rezoning of property already platted or zoned for residential uses, the applicant for such replatting or rezoning shall pay cash in lieu only for the difference between such rezoned residential use and the prior residential use previously paid for. However, an applicant seeking rezoning or replatting of a residential
Page 620 of 878
land use shall not be permitted to receive any reimbursement of cash in lieu previously paid therefore. In the event that an applicant, owner, or developer cannot comply with the provisions of this Article, either by deeding seven percent (7%) of useable land to be developed or by paying cash in lieu therefore, the application for plat approval or application for zoning shall not be heard and considered by the City of Dickinson.
vi. Off-site assessment
(a) Any party applying for a Limited Commercial, Downtown Commercial, Community Commercial, General Commercial, Limited Industrial, or General Industrial zoning designation on any property within the corporate limits of the City of Dickinson shall be assessed an off-site impact assessment for the Park District.
(b) Such off-site impact assessment shall be in amounts as may be determined by the Board of City Commissioners, and included, by resolution, in the annual City Fee Schedule. The City shall work with the Park District to determine the amount of the off-site impact assessment.
(c) Such payment shall be calculated by the City, and shall be due and payable from the applicant for zoning at the time of zoning approval as a part of the application fee therefore. No zoning change shall be approved by the City prior to such payment being made.
(d) In the event that an applicant, owner, or developer cannot comply with the provisions of this Article by paying the off-site impact assessment therefore, the application for plat approval or application for zoning shall be denied.
vii. Any or all of the requirements of this section may be waived upon a two- thirds majority vote of the entire planning and zoning commission. (Ord. No. 1491 § 1; Ord. No. 1684, § 1.)

This title sets forth uniform requirements for Storm Water management systems within the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. It is the intent of the Board of City Commissioners that the requirements and standards contained in this ordinance comply with all applicable state and federal laws. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this ordinance and the provisions of an erosion control, shoreline protection, or floodplain ordinance, or other regulations adopted by the City, County, State or Federal authorities, the more restrictive standard prevails.
The objectives of this title are:
1. To promote, preserve, and enhance the natural resources within the City of Dickinson, its extraterritorial jurisdiction and water sheds;
2. To protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the people and property through effective Storm Water management practices;
Page 674 of 878
3. To protect the Citys natural resources from adverse impacts occasioned by development or other activities;
4. To regulate land development, land disturbing, or other activities that may have an adverse and potentially irreversible impact on water quality and environmentally sensitive lands;
5. To minimize conflicts and encourage compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and environmentally sensitive issues (i.e. land, water, habitat, etc.);
6. To require detailed review standards and procedures for land development activities proposed throughout the City, and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, water sheds and to persons outside the City who are, by contract or agreement with the City, users of the City Storm Water system, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development, and the protection of water quality; and
7. To provide for adequate Storm Water system analysis and appropriate Storm Water system design as necessary to protect public and private property, water quality, and existing natural resources. This title establishes and provides for the following Storm Water management criteria:
a) The regulation of development through the issuance of Storm Water permits and through the enforcement of general Storm Water drainage requirements throughout the City as they relate to managing Storm Water volumes, rates of runoff, flow duration, and their subsequent impacts to downstream property and Storm Water management facilities.
b) The regulation of, and the establishment of criteria for, existing public underground storm sewers, existing artificial and natural open channel drainage systems, existing Storm Water detention and retention ponds, and existing private Storm Water drainage systems discharging into the public system.
c) Provides for a Storm Water management system user charge and the method for calculating charges for each user classification for the equitable distribution of costs associated with the administration of the Storm Water management program established herein. Procedures for rate adjustments and annual review criteria are established.
d) Penalties for violating the provisions of this ordinance, and the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. (Ord. No. 1282 § 2.)

This section was repealed with Ordinance No. 1245 approved May 6, 2002.
Section 38.20.046 Storm Water Service Charge
(1) Generally. A monthly storm water charge shall be collected for each property located within the Dickinson city limits. The storm water charge shall be collected either from each water meter connection or on a monthly billing in lieu of the water meter connection. This charge shall be based on the square footage and use of the property draining into the citys storm drainage system and served by said water meter. This charge is based on the estimated increase in storm water runoff rates resulting from property development. This increase is to be determined by subtracting the runoff coefficient for undeveloped property from the runoff coefficient of the developed property, for the purpose of determining the monthly storm water surcharge. Based upon engineering judgment, the following runoff coefficients are adopted:
Low Density Residential 0.35
Mobile Home Parks 0.35
High Density Residential 0.45
Public Buildings 0.55
Commercial 0.75
Page 693 of 878
Undeveloped Land 0.15
Property within the city limits shall be assessed a monthly base charge. In addition, a surcharge will be charged for areas in excess of 20,000 square feet in all areas except low density residential and mobile home parks. The amount of the monthly base charge and surcharge shall be determined from time to time by the Board of City Commissioners in the City of Dickinson fee schedule. The initial monthly base charges and surcharges, until changed by the Board of City Commissioners as set forth above, shall be as set forth below:

Page 734 of 878
16. The permit holder shall appear annually before the Planning and Zoning Commission for renewal of the permit. The Planning Department may require an annual site inspection prior to renewal.
17. Any permit issued under this Section shall be non-transferrable as to the permit holder and/or the premises to be permitted.

19. Complaints regarding any zoning violation or any other condition of the permit shall be investigated by the Planning Department.
20. In the event a complaint is made, regardless of which department investigates, the Planning Department may conduct a site visit to determine whether the permit holder is in compliance with the terms of the Permit. The Planning Director may require the permit holder to appear before the Planning and Zoning Commission to address the complaint.
21. In the event two complaints of any nature against the permit holder are substantiated and validated through a hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission, within a rolling twelve month period, the Planning & Zoning Commission shall revoke the special use permit. Upon revocation, the permit holder shall cease operations within thirty days, or appeal the decision to the City Commission. Failure to appeal within thirty days of the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall constitute forfeiture of all rights of appeal, and the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall become final. If the permit holder appeals to the City Commission, the applicant may continue its operations until a decision has been rendered by the City Commission. If the City Commission affirms the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the permit holder shall have fifteen days from the date of the decision of the City Commission to cease operations.

Table 4-1 Purposes of Zoning District
Symbol
Title
Purpose
AG
Agricultural District
The AG District provides for and preserves the agricultural and rural use of land, while accommodating very low density residential development generally associated with agricultural uses. This district is designed to maintain complete agricultural uses within the Dickinson extra-territorial jurisdiction.
RR
Rural Residential
This district provides for the rural residential use of land, accommodating very low and low density residential environments. The districts regulations assure that density is developed consistent with: land use policies of the Dickinson Comprehensive Plan regarding rural subdivision; levels of infrastructure; and environmentally sensitive development practices. The district also accommodates developments that merge urban living with rural life.
R-1
Low-Density Residential
This district is intended to provide for low-density residential neighborhoods, characterized by single-family dwellings on relatively large lots with supporting community facilities and urban services. Its regulations are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.
Page 739 of 878
R-2
Medium-Density Residential
This district is intended to provide for medium-density residential neighborhoods, characterized by single-family dwellings on small to moderately sized lots and low-density, multiple-family development. It adapts to both established and developing neighborhoods, as well as transitional areas between single-family and multi-family neighborhoods. Its regulations are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.
R-3
High-Density Residential
This district is intended to provide locations primarily for multiple-family housing, with supporting and appropriate community facilities. It also permits some non-residential uses such as offices through a special permit procedure, to permit the development of mixed use neighborhoods.
MH
Mobile Home Residential
This district recognizes that mobile home development, properly planned, can provide important opportunities for affordable housing. It provides opportunities for mobile home development within planned parks or subdivision, along with the supporting services necessary to create quality residential neighborhoods.
LC
Limited Commercial
This district reserves appropriately located area for office development and a limited variety of low-impact commercial facilities which serve the needs of residents of surrounding residential communities. The commercial and office uses permitted are compatible with nearby residential areas. Development regulations are designed to ensure compatibility in size, scale, and landscaping with nearby residences.
CC
Community Commercial
This district is intended for commercial facilities which serve the needs of markets ranging from several neighborhoods to the overall region. While allowed commercial and office uses are generally compatible with nearby residential areas, traffic and operating characteristics may have more negative effects on residential neighborhoods than those permitted in the LC District. CC Districts are appropriate at major intersections, at the junction of several neighborhoods, or at substantial commercial
Page 740 of 878
sub-centers. Outdoor storage shall be limited and screened.
DC
Downtown Commercial District
This district is intended to provide appropriate development regulations for Downtown Dickinson. Mixed uses are permitted within the DC District and are encouraged in multi-story structures. The grouping of uses is designed to strengthen the town centers role as a center for trade, service, and civic life.
GC
General Commercial
This district accommodates a variety of commercial uses, some of which have significant traffic or visual effect. These districts may include commercial uses which are oriented to services, including automotive services, rather than retail activities. These uses may create land use conflicts with adjacent residential areas, requiring provision of adequate buffering. This district is most appropriately located along major arterial streets or in areas that can be adequately buffered from residential districts.
LI
Limited Industrial
This district is intended to reserve sites appropriate for the location of industrial uses with relatively limited environmental effects. The district is designed to provide appropriate space and regulations to encourage good quality industrial development, while assuring that facilities are served with adequate parking and loading facilities.
GI
General Industrial
This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of industrial uses, some of which may have significant external effects. These uses may have operating characteristics that create conflicts with lower-intensity surrounding land uses. The district provides the reservation of land for these activities and includes buffering requirements to reduce incompatibility.
P
Public
This district accommodates substantial public institutions or uses. It sets aside areas for conservation, public recreation, and full access public facilities.

Section 39.05.019 Purpose
FP/FW FLOODPLAIN/FLOODWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 39.05.020 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
3. Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
4. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program when identified by the Federal Insurance Administration as a flood prone community. (Ord. No. 1171 § 1.)
Section 39.05.020 Floodplain and Floodway Overlay Districts: Findings of Fact
Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation
Flood hazard areas of the City of Dickinson, North Dakota, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
Page 756 of 878
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
1. General Causes of These Flood Losses
These flood losses are caused by (a) the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities, (b) the occupancy of flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages.
2. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards
This ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps.
a) Selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one (1%) percent change of occurrence in anyone year, as delineated by applicable Flood Insurance Studies and the Federal Emergency Management Administrations Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, or any subsequent effective Flood Insurance Studies, Rate Maps, and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps issued after the effective date of this ordinance and adopted by the City of Dickinson.
b) Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood.
c) Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.
d) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height.
e) Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood.
Land to Which Ordinance Applies
This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Dickinson identified on the Flood Insurance Rate map (FIRM) as numbered and unnumbered A zone and/or within the Overlay Districts FP and FW established in this ordinance. In all areas covered by this ordinance, no development shall be permitted except upon a permit to develop granted by the City Council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community as contained in the City Code.
Enforcement Officer
The Zoning Administrator of the City of Dickinson is hereby designated as the City Council s duly designated Enforcement Officer under this ordinance. Unless otherwise provided by the City Council, the Natural Resources Commission shall assist the City of Dickinson on interpretation of floodplain/floodway rules and regulations. The Enforcement
Page 757 of 878
Officer shall obtain comments from the NRC as part of his/her review of all proposed activity in this Overlay District.
Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries
The boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute. The base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires.
Compliance
No development located within known flood hazard areas of the community shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restriction. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Interpretation
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City of Dickinson and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute.
Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Dickinson or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Severability
If any section, clause, provision or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
Application for Appeal
Where a request for a permit to develop is denied by the Zoning Administrator, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment. Procedures for appeals to the Board of Adjustment shall proceed as set forth by Section 39.12.010b of this Ordinance. (Ord. No. 1171 § 1.)
Page 758 of 878
Section 39.05.021 Floodplain and Floodway Permits and Administration

The mapped flood plain area within the jurisdiction of this ordinance are hereby divided into the two following districts: A Floodway Overlay District (FW) and a Floodplan Overlay District (FP) as identified in the official Flood Plain Study. Within these districts, all uses not meeting the standards of this ordinance and those standards of the underlying zoning district shall be prohibited. These zones shall be consistent with the numbered and unnumbered A
Page 759 of 878
Zones as identified on the official FIRM when identified in the Flood Insurance Study provided by the Federal Insurance Administration. (Ord. No. 1171 § 1.)
Section 39.05.023 Standards for Floodway Overlay District and Floodplain Overlay District
a. No permit for development shall be granted for new construction, substantial improvement or other improvements including the placement of manufactured homes within the identified flood plain unless the conditions of this section are satisfied.
b. All areas identified as unnumbered A Zones by the Federal Insurance Administration are subject to inundation of the 100-year flood; however, the water surface elevation was not provided. The unnumbered A Zones shall be subject to all development provisions of this ordinance. If Flood Insurance Study Data is not available, the community shall utilize any base flood elevation data currently available within its area of jurisdiction. Further, in cases of proposed development within unnumbered  A zones, the developer s engineer shall be required to conduct the necessary studies to determine the 100 year flood elevation and its extent in relation to such development.
c. New construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvement, prefabricated building, placement of manufactured homes and other development shall require:
1. Design or anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effect of buoyancy.
2. New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination.
3. Construction with materials resistant to flood damage, utilizing methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and with electrical, heating, ventilation that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
4. All utility and sanitary facilities be elevated or floodproofed one foot above the regulatory flood elevation. Such floodproofing is permitted only for non-residential properties.
5. That until a floodway has been designated, no development including landfill, may be permitted within the identified flood plain unless the applicant for the land use has demonstrated that the proposed use, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated uses, will not increase the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1 ) foot on the average cross-section of the reach in which the development or landfill is located as shown in the official flood plan study incorporated by reference herein.
6. Storage of Materials and Equipment
a) The storage of processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyancy, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited.
b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if
Page 760 of 878
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
7. Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivision, be required to assure that:
a) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
b) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
c) Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
d) Proposals for development (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) of five (5) acres or fifty (50) lots, whichever is less, include within such proposals the regulatory flood elevation. (Ord. No. 1171 § 1.)

Or risk premium rates are those established by the Federal Insurance Administrator pursuant to individual community studies and investigations which are undertaken to provide flood insurance in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 4014 and the accepted actuarial principles. Actuarial rates include provisions for operating costs and allowances.
Appeal. A request for a review of the Zoning Administrators interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.
Area of Shallow Flooding. A designated AO or AH zone on a community s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of Special Flood Hazard. The land in the flood plain within a community subject to one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Base Flood Elevation. Elevation indicated in the official flood plain study as the elevation of the 100-year flood.
Base Flood Protection Elevation. An elevation one foot higher than the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Channel. A natural or artificial watercourse of perceptible extent, with a definite bed and banks to confine and conduct continuously or periodically flowing water. Channel flow, thus, is that water which is flowing within the limits of a defined channel.
Community. Any state or area or political subdivision thereof which has authority to adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations for the area within its jurisdiction.
Development. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
Page 766 of 878
Existing Construction. (For the purposes of determining rates) structures for which the  start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRM s effective before that date. Existing Construction may also be referred to as existing structures.
Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) the overflow of inland or tidal waters; (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which the Flood Insurance Study has delineated the Flood Hazard Boundaries and the zones establishing insurance rates applicable to the community.
Flood Insurance Study. The official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the Flood Boundary Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Flood Plain Management. The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to, emergency preparedness plan, flood control works, and flood plain management regulations.
Flood Protection System. Those physical structural works constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a special flood hazard. Such a system typically includes levees or dikes. These specialized modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
Floodproofing. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, including utility and sanitary facilities, which would preclude the entry of water. Structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy.

Section 39.07.0055 DC Downtown Commercial District Commercial Development Standards
a. Purpose
The purpose of the Downtown Commercial District is to preserve and enhance the mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented nature of the Citys downtown area. The district allows a wide range of mutually supportive uses in order to enhance downtown Dickinsons role as a commercial, cultural, governmental, health or medical, entertainment and residential center. The district standards also facilitate the creation of a strong and distinctive sense of place through the inclusion of open space and public plazas. The use of design standards will maintain the historical integrity, enhance the quality of design, and preserve the human-scale development of downtown.
b. Uses
Uses are allowed in the Downtown Commercial District in accordance with Table 4-2 of Article 39.04 of the City Municipal Code
c. Dimensional Standards.
Commercial development within the Downtown Commercial District is subject to the following dimensional standards:
1. Front Yard Setback. There is no minimum front yard setback. The maximum front yard setback for all new construction shall be five (5) feet. Structures constructed on a corner shall be subject to the vision clearance zone requirements as they appear in Section 39.07.002 of this Code. If the development site is between two existing buildings which are both setback from the front property line, the front yard setback
Page 808 of 878
may not exceed the average setback of the adjoining buildings. In no case shall a setback greater than 15 feet be allowed. Consideration shall be given to privately-owned spaces that are designed to provide space for public seating, public events, public displays, public gatherings and public performance. The area must be landscaped and incorporate streetscape elements.
2. Side Yard Setback. There is no minimum side yard setback, unless the side property line abuts residentially-zoned property, in which case the minimum side yard setback shall be 6 feet. Structures constructed on a corner shall be subject to the vision clearance zone requirements as they appear in Section 39.07.002 of this Code.
3. Rear Yard Setback. There is no minimum rear yard setback, unless the rear property line abuts residentially-zoned property, in which case the minimum rear yard setback shall be 10 feet. Structures constructed on a corner shall be subject to the vision clearance zone requirements as they appear in Section 39.07.002 of this Code.
4. Height. The minimum height for new construction is 20 feet. The maximum height in the Downtown Commercial District is 65 feet unless a special use permit is granted in accordance with Article 39.12 of this Municipal Code.
d. Design Standards.
All development within the Downtown Commercial District is subject to the following design standards:
1. Intent. The intent of the design standards is to create and maintain a high visual quality and appearance for the Downtown Commercial District. The regulations are also intended to ensure that new buildings, building additions, façade alterations, building rehabilitations, and signage are compatible with or improve the character of the Downtown Commercial District, fit into their surroundings, and blend in with the historic character of the area. It is also the intent of these regulations to stimulate and protect public and private investment through the establishment of high standards with respect to architectural design, building materials, and appearance, and to support the preservation of historically significant buildings.
2. Review and Approval. All new buildings, building additions, facade alterations (both structural and non-structural), demolition of existing buildings, signage, streetscape installation or modification, fences, lighting and improvements within the public right-of-way within the Downtown Commercial District shall be subject to the Citys downtown design review procedures and shall adhere to existing lighting and tree planting plans. An administrative decision by the City Planning Director regarding the proposed design may be appealed to the Citys Planning and Zoning Commission subject to standard hearing procedures. Any decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission regarding design standards may be appealed to the City Commission.
3. Remodeling of Historically Significant Buildings. Any building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, identified as being individually eligible for listing on the National Register or identified in the Local Landmark
Page 809 of 878
Program, historic district, or any subsequent inventory and evaluation, is considered to be a historically significant building. For any building not identified above that is more than 50 years old, a determination shall be made by the Planning Director on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not the building is historically significant. Projects involving the remodeling, renovation or rehabilitation of existing historically significant buildings should generally reflect the original architectural character of the building. The introduction of any new design elements should be consistent with the traditional features of the building. The rehabilitation of existing historically significant buildings is encouraged to be in accordance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation.
4. New Construction. Projects involving new construction shall consider the context of the site and be compatible with the general historic character of the downtown area. While new buildings are required to fit into their surroundings, the City will not require complete uniformity of design or dictate specific architectural styles. The overall context of the downtown area includes a variety of architectural styles and these regulations are intended to allow both flexibility and creativity in achieving compatible design solutions while preserving similar facades, with similar building materials, complementing the historic character of the downtown.
5. Building Materials. For new construction, all walls visible from any street shall be primarily faced with architectural materials such as brick, stone, glass, exterior insulation finish insulation systems, or an equivalent or better. The use of plain surface concrete block and/or simple metal siding shall be prohibited (i.e. the surface must be dimensional). The use of typical residential exterior materials shall be prohibited (i.e. residential grade vinyl siding, residential grade steel siding, composite brick). Non-transparent mirrored or one-way glass with a reflectance greater than forty percent (40%) shall be prohibited from covering more than forty percent (40%) of the exterior walls. When remodeling all original door and window cut outs shall be used to preserve the buildings historic character.
All subsequent renovations, additions and related structures undertaken after the construction of an original building shall be finished with materials comparable to those used in the original construction and shall be designed in a manner conforming to the original architectural design and general appearance. For existing historically significant buildings, the sheathing or installation of another material over the facade or any wall visible from any street shall be prohibited unless deemed necessary to preserve the structural integrity of the building.
6. Building Colors. In order to maintain a sense of harmony within the Downtown Commercial District, color schemes used should complement the predominant hues of adjoining established and occupied buildings. Color schemes should generally be simple, using the minimum number of colors necessary to accentuate architectural features. Earth tone colors are the preferred building colors within the Downtown Commercial District. The use of extremely bright hues should generally be limited to smaller accent features of the building.
Page 810 of 878
Repainting projects which do not substantially change the existing color scheme are not subject to the building color criteria.
7. Alignment. New infill development in the Downtown Commercial District shall maintain the zero setback and the alignment of adjoining facades at the property line.
8. Width. New buildings shall reflect the existing characteristic rhythm of facades along the street. New construction on multiple lots, including parking ramps, should respect this pattern by designing the pattern of adjacent façade widths into the new facade.
9. Horizontal Rhythms. New development shall maintain the alignment of building windows, cornices, and rooflines that dominate the block on which it will be constructed. Character and scale shall be compatible with surrounding structures through the use of materials, detailing and window placement. A clear visual division between the street level and upper floors shall also be maintained. Canopies and awnings consistent with the architectural style of the building are encouraged to accentuate the street level relationship between the building and streetscape and to provide protection for pedestrians as long as it does not conflict with existing or planned tree or lighting expansions in the public right-of-way.
10. Entrances. Main entrances to buildings shall face and be clearly visible from the street, and be recessed to maintain a coherent pattern along the sidewalk and to define the entry point. Recessed entrances shall allow operation of the door(s) without the doors extending beyond the property line into the public right-of-way. Secondary alley access shall be utilized whenever possible.
11. Windows. Ground floor windows shall be transparent. The original size, shape and proportion of all windows on existing historically significant buildings shall be preserved and/or restored. For new non-residential buildings, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of first floor facades fronting the street shall be windows, doors and other transparent elements. In order to preserve the character of existing historically significant buildings, it is not the intent of this provision to require windows to be installed where none existed in the original design. However, if the exterior of an existing historically significant building is being remodeled, renovated or rehabilitated, the size, shape and proportion of the original window openings shall be restored or maintained. Replacement windows shall generally conform to the style and color of the original windows used in the building, with wood or prefinished aluminum as the finish material. White framed windows shall be discouraged unless it is part of the historical existing structure.
12. Rooftop Equipment. Rooftop equipment shall be screened from ground level views with parapet walls or enclosures similar in form, material and detail to the facade of the primary structure.
13. Vacant Buildings. Vacant and abandoned buildings shall be made to appear inhabited. Boarding up windows in vacant or abandoned buildings shall be prohibited. The placement of displays of building renovations, downtown renovations, and upcoming events is encouraged.
Page 811 of 878
14. Demolition and Vacant Lots. Any demolition shall be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 7 of the City Municipal Code. Any lots left vacant after demolition shall be treated to control fugitive dust. If the lot is to remain vacant for more than sixty (60) days, said lot shall be landscaped, mulched and seeded or sodded to establish a perennial vegetative grass cover. The lot shall be maintained and kept free of debris and litter by the property owner.
15. Exposed Common Walls. If common walls are exposed due to demolition of adjoining buildings, the walls shall be treated to ensure that the walls do not become a visual eyesore and/or create a nuisance. The treatment may be temporary or permanent depending on the potential for redevelopment of adjoining parcels. Temporary alternative treatments include masonry paint or vines. Permanent alternative treatments include architectural treatment that is similar to the front façade of the building or stucco. The wall treatment shall be in place within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the date of demolition, unless a longer period is authorized at the time of approval of the demolition plans, and shall be the financial responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the demolished building was located.
16. Off-street Parking and Loading. Off-street parking and loading shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of Article 39.09 of the Municipal Code.
17. Landscaping and Screening and Other Decorative Features. New construction and major remodeling, renovation or rehabilitation projects shall be subject to the requirements of Article 39.09 of the Municipal Code, including the installation of street trees and lighting if required. If decorative fencing, decorative lighting and any other streetscape elements are required or proposed, they shall be consistent with the Citys lighting and urban forestry plans or complementary to any downtown streetscape that has already been installed.
18. Signage. All signage in the Downtown Commercial District shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of Chapters 33 and 39 of the City Code of Ordinances. Canopies used for signage shall be consistent with the architectural style of the building and shall not interfere with the City lighting and tree planting downtown. Off-premises signs shall not be permitted within the Downtown Commercial District. (Ord. No. 1650 § 1.)
Section 39.07.006 Appeals
Denial, revocations, or cancellations of a building permit based on the provisions of this Section may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment, as set forth in Sections 39.12.010 through 39.12.012. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of administrative decisions regarding proposed design in the Downtown Commercial zoning district shall follow the process found in Section 39.07.0055 of this Code.
