BELEN, NEW MEXICO MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Belen, New Mexico 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 15, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Belen, New Mexico Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1998, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 15, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Sally G. Garley, assistant city manager/clerk. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. Beginning with Supplement No. 15, this legislative history will be complemented by a "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List," following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification. 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2018-05, passed September 4, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 15, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 15, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 15, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 15, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 15, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

2.32.110 - Elections. 
A.  Whenever, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board, a petition is filed by a labor organization containing the signatures of at least thirty (30) percent of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, the board shall post a notice to affected employees regarding the filed petition and proceed with the process for conducting a secret ballot representation election. 
B.  Once a labor organization has filed a petition with the board requesting a representation election, other labor organizations may seek to be placed on the ballot. Any labor organization may file a competing petition containing the signatures of not less than thirty (30) percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit no later than ten (10) calendar days after the board has posted a written notice that a petition for a representation election has been filed by a labor organization. 
C.  All representation elections shall include the option for "no representation", except in a run-off election where the choice of "no representation" was not one (1) of the two (2) choices that received the highest votes. 
D.  In the event of an election with two (2) or more labor organizations on the ballot and none of the choices on the ballot received a majority of the votes cast, then a run-off election shall be held within fifteen (15) calendar days. The choices on the run-off election shall consist of the two (2) choices, which received the greatest number of votes in the original election. 
E.  A valid election requires that at least forty (40) percent of the eligible employees in an appropriate bargaining unit cast a vote. In an election with only one (1) labor organization, and the majority of the votes cast are in favor of representation the board shall certify that labor organization as the exclusive representative for all the employees in the bargaining unit. 
F.  No election shall be conducted if an election has been conducted in the twelve-month period immediately preceding the proposed representation election. No election shall be held during the term of an existing collective bargaining agreement, except as provided in Section 2.32.130(B) of this section, or after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three (3) years. 
G.  Election disputes shall be resolved by the board. 
H.  As an alternative to the provisions of subsection A of this section, the employer and a labor organization with a reasonable basis for claiming to represent a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit may establish an alternative appropriate procedure for determining majority status. The procedure may include a labor organization's submission of authorization cards from a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit. The local board shall not certify an appropriate bargaining unit if the employer objects to the certification without an election. 
(Ord. 1994-2 § 11) 
(Ord. No. 2014-02, § 11, 3-3-2014) 
2.32.120 - Exclusive representation. 
    A labor organization that has been certified by the board as the exclusive representative for employees in an appropriate bargaining unit shall represent all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall act for all employees in the bargaining unit and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement covering all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall represent the interests of all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination or regard to membership or non-membership in the labor organization. The existence of an exclusive bargaining representative shall not prevent employees from taking their grievances through the grievance process or filing prohibited practices with the board. Any settlement of a grievance or relief given on a prohibited practice brought by an individual shall not be inconsistent with or in violation of the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the employer and the exclusive representative or inconsistent with or in violation of a memorandum of understanding between the employer and the exclusive representative applicable to the day-to-day administration of the collective bargaining agreement. The exclusive representative shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at such hearings and make its views known. 
(Ord. 1994-2 § 12) 
(Ord. No. 2014-02, § 12, 3-3-2014) 
2.32.130 - Decertification of exclusive representative. 
A.  Any member of a labor organization or the labor organization itself may initiate decertification of a labor organization as the exclusive representative if thirty (30) percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit make a written request to the board for a decertification election. A decertification election shall be valid only if at least forty (40) percent of the eligible employees in the bargaining unit vote in the election. 
B.  When there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect, a request for a decertification election shall be made to the board no earlier than ninety (90) days and no later than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, that a request for a decertification election may be filed at any time after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three (3) years. 
C.  When, within the time period prescribed in subsection B of this section, a competing labor organization files a petition containing signatures of at least thirty (30) percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit, a representation election rather than a decertification election shall be conducted. 
D.  When an exclusive representative has been certified but no collective bargaining agreement is in effect, the board shall not accept a request for a decertification election earlier than twelve (12) months subsequent to a labor organization's certification as the exclusive representative. 
(Ord. 1994-2 § 13) 
(Ord. No. 2014-02, § 13, 3-3-2014) 
2.32.140 - Scope of bargaining. 
A.  Except for retirement programs provided under the Public Employees Retirement Act, the parties shall bargain in good faith on all wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment and other issues agreed to by the parties. The parties shall enter into a written agreement covering employment relations regarding the issues agreed to in collective bargaining. 
B.  Bargaining in good faith shall not require either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession. 
C.  The obligation to bargain collectively imposed by the labor-management relations chapter shall not be construed as authorizing employers and exclusive representatives to enter into any agreement that is in conflict with state statutes or federal statutes. In the event of conflict between the provision of any federal or state statutes and any agreement entered into by the employer and the exclusive representative, the former shall prevail. 
D.  Payroll deduction of the exclusive representative's membership dues shall be a mandatory subject of bargaining if either party chooses to negotiate the issue. The amount of dues shall be certified in writing by an official of the labor organization and shall not include special assessments, penalties, or fines of any type levied by the exclusive representative. During the time that a board certification is in effect for a particular exclusive representative, the employer shall not deduct dues for any other labor organization from members of the same bargaining unit. 
E.  Fair share is a permissive subject of bargaining. 
F.  Any agreement or impasse resolution by the employer and an exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds to fund the agreed upon provision. An arbitrator's decision shall not require the re-appropriation of funds. 
G.  The parties have a requirement that a grievance procedure culminating with final and binding arbitration be negotiated. This applies only to grievances and the interpretation and application of the agreement between the parties and does not apply to negotiation impasses. The parties shall share the cost of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party is responsible for paying any cost related to its witnesses and representation. 
(Ord. 1994-2 § 14) 
(Ord. No. 2014-02, § 14, 3-3-2014)

B.  The following negotiation procedures shall apply to the employer and exclusive representatives:

The parties may open negotiations at any time by mutual agreement. 
2.  All negotiations will be conducted in closed sessions. Negotiations will be held at a facility and at a time mutually agreed upon by the parties. 
3.  Recesses and study sessions may be called by either team. Prior to the conclusion of any negotiating sessions, the reconvening time will be agreed upon. Caucuses may be taken as needed. 
4.  Tentative agreements reached during negotiations will be reduced to writing, dated, and initialed by each team spokesperson. Such tentative agreements are conditional and may be withdrawn should later discussion change either party's understanding of the language as it related to another part of the agreement. 
5.  Agreement on contract negotiations is accomplished when the union president and the city manager sign the agreement. Provisions in multi-year agreements providing for economic increases for subsequent years shall be contingent upon the governing body appropriating the funds necessary to fund the increase for the subsequent year(s). Should the governing body not appropriate sufficient funds to fund the agreed upon increase, either party may reopen negotiations. 
C.  The following impasse procedure shall be followed by the employer and exclusive representative: 
1.  If an impasse occurs, either party shall request mediation assistance. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, either party may request the assistance of the federal mediation and conciliation service; 
2.  If the impasse continues after thirty (30) calendar days, either party may request an unrestricted list of seven (7) arbitrators from the federal mediation and conciliation service. The parties shall choose one (1) arbitrator by alternately striking names from such list. Which party strikes the first name shall be determined by coin toss. The arbitrator shall render a final, binding, written decision resolving unresolved issues no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the arbitrator has been notified of his or her selection by the parties. The arbitrator's decision shall be limited to a selection of one (1) of the two (2) parties' complete, last, best offer. However, an impasse resolution decision of an arbitrator or an agreement provision by the employer and an exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds. An arbitrator's decision shall not require the employer to re-appropriate funds. The parties shall share all of the arbitrator's costs incurred pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party shall be responsible for paying any costs related to its witnesses and representation.

Chapter 9.20 - NUISANCE ABATEMENT 
Sections: 

9.20.010 - Intent. 
    The public purpose of this chapter is to prevent the use of private property as a marketplace for the sale of illegal drugs, as a haven for drug use, as a location for drug-related or other organized criminal activity, and/or as a place to which persons habitually or routinely go for the purpose of prostitution or gambling.

9.20.020 - Short title. 
    Sections 9.20.020 et seq. may be cited as the "nuisance abatement ordinance. 
(Ord. 1999-04 (part), 1999) 
9.20.030 - Findings. 
    The city council makes the following findings: 
A.  Illegal drugs and drug-related criminal activity or other organized criminal activity, prostitution, and gambling adversely affects all neighborhoods throughout the city. 
B.  Prostitution, gambling, drugs, drug-related criminal activity, or other organized criminal activity have caused an increase in crime and violence and have deteriorated the habitability of housing and rental accommodations in the city. This adverse effect is evidenced by: 
1.  Social-scientific studies which clearly show that a high proportion of violent and property crimes are committed by individuals who are engaged in prostitution, gambling, drug-related criminal activity or other organized criminal activity; 
2.  Studies which show that narcotic addiction directly causes an increase in crime intended to provide income to support the offender's addiction; 
3.  Sociological evidence which shows a relationship between prostitution, gambling or other drug-related criminal activity and the material and aesthetic deterioration of neighboring private property. 
C.  Prostitution, gambling, drugs and drug-related criminal activity or other organized criminal activity on or near private property have adversely impacted and continue to adversely impact our city by: 
1.  Diminishing property value; 
2.  Increasing the volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and from private property used as a marketplace for the sale of drugs and as a hideout for drug use, creating unsafe conditions for neighborhood residents, especially children; 
3.  Encouraging threatening solicitations by strangers wishing to sell illegal drugs; 
4.  Fostering the display and use of dangerous weapons and the discharge of firearms on or near private property; 
5.  Increasing the number of violations of the criminal statutes, the Uniform Building Code, the Uniform Fire Code and the zoning ordinance; 
6.  Decreasing the public order and reducing the ability of residents to enforce community norms; 
7.  Increasing the incidence of petty crimes on or to public or private property, including vandalism and destruction of the neighboring public/private property, an increase in trash and debris on public/private property, and other crimes which result in the physical decay of our city's neighborhoods; and 
8.  Having a continual and on-going detrimental effect on the surrounding community and on our city as a whole regardless of the location of property. 
D.  Eliminating the use of property for prostitution, gambling, drug-related criminal activity, or other organized criminal activity for an extended period of time will have a substantial positive impact on the community. The benefit to the community will include: 
1.  A reduction in the number of persons who intend to engage in prostitution, gambling, drug-related criminal activity, or other organized criminal activity and the relative concentration of such persons in affected communities; 
2.  The elimination of the locations participating in prostitution, gambling, drug-related criminal activity, or other organized criminal activity; 
3.  A reduction in the number of drug addicts and the availability of illegal drugs in the community; 
4.  A reduction in the addicts' income generating crime in the surrounding neighborhood; 
5.  A reduction in the number of prostitutes in the community; and 
6.  A reduction in the amount of organized criminal gang activity in the community. 
E.  Substantially reducing the incidence of prostitution, gambling, organized crime, or other drug-related criminal activity in our city's neighborhoods will substantially improve conditions for our city as a whole by: 
1.  Reducing city-wide violent, property and drug-related crimes; 
2.  Reducing the drug-related criminal activity in our city, allowing our city's police department to address other law enforcement issues of great concern to our city; 
3.  Increasing the general public order and improving the ability of our city to deal with other issues of public concern; 
4.  Improving property values in our city; and 
5.  Improving the quality of life for all city residents. 
F.  Based on all the evidence presented before it, the council finds that property used for prostitution, gambling, drug-related criminal activity, or other organized criminal activity adversely affects public health, welfare, and safety at all time and under any circumstances.

2.  The term "penalty assessment misdemeanor" does not include any violation which has caused or contributed to the cause of an accident resulting in injury or death to any person. 
3.  When an alleged violator of a penalty assessment misdemeanor elects to accept a notice to appear in lieu of a notice of penalty assessment, no fine imposed upon later conviction shall exceed the penalty assessment established for the particular penalty assessment misdemeanor and no probation imposed upon a suspended or deferred sentence shall exceed ninety (90) days. 
4.  The penalty assessment for speeding in violation of subsection 12-6-1.2(4) of the Uniform Traffic Ordinance is twice the penalty assessment established in subsection 10.04.140B.1 for the equivalent miles per hour over the speed limit. 
5.  In addition to the penalty assessment established for each penalty assessment misdemeanor pursuant to this section, there shall be assessed the following fees for each penalty assessment misdemeanor: a twenty-dollar corrections fee; a six-dollar court automation fee; and three-dollar judicial education fee. 
C.  Penalty Assessment Misdemeanors; Option; Effect. 
1.  Unless a warning notice is given, at the time of making an arrest for any penalty assessment misdemeanor, the arresting officer shall offer the alleged violator the option of accepting a penalty assessment. The violator's signature on the penalty assessment notice constitutes an acknowledgement of guilt of the offense stated in the notice, and payment of the prescribed penalty assessment is a complete satisfaction of the violation. 
2.  Payment of any penalty assessment must be made by mail to the Municipal Court, Traffic Violations Bureau, City of Belen, New Mexico, within thirty (30) days from the date of arrest. Payments of penalty assessments are timely if postmarked within the time limits set from the date of arrest. The traffic violations bureau shall issue a receipt when a penalty assessment is paid by currency, but a check tendered by the violator upon which payment is received is sufficient receipt. 
3.  No record of any penalty assessment payment is admissible as evidence in any court in any civil action. 
D.  Failure to Pay Penalty Assessment. 
1.  If a penalty assessment is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of arrest, the violator shall be prosecuted for the violation charged on the penalty assessment notice in a manner as if the penalty assessment notice had not been issued. Upon conviction in such prosecution, the court shall impose penalties as provided by the New Mexico Uniform Traffic Ordinance (Section 12-12-1.1), or other law relating to motor vehicles for the particular offense charged, and the scheduled penalty assessments shall not apply. 
2.  In addition to the prosecution provided for in subsection D.1, it is a misdemeanor for any person who has elected to pay a penalty assessment to failure to do so within thirty (30) days from the date of arrest. 
3.  The office of the municipal court shall notify the Motor Vehicle Division of the State of New Mexico when a person fails to pay a penalty assessment within the required period of time. The motor vehicle division shall report the notice upon the driver's record and shall not renew the person's license to drive until the municipal court notifies the motor vehicle division that the penalty assessment, or its equivalent, as well as any additional penalties imposed are properly disposed of.

Chapter 10.20 - SPEED HUMP POLICY FOR STREETS[2] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2011-05, adopted May 2, 2011, amended Ch. 10.20 in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 10.20, §§ 10.20.010-10.20.070, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 2000-07. 

10.20.010 - Purpose. 
    Reducing excessive speeds on residential streets is an important objective in ensuring the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and vehicles in neighborhoods, and in creating a calmer and more livable environment. Methods for discouraging speeding include enforcement, education and engineering efforts. While police enforcement remains the most effective means of dealing with speeding, limited resources prevent officers from covering all of the problem locations at all times. In response to this concern, the City of Belen has developed this policy which addresses engineering efforts, specifically the use of speed humps, as a "traffic calming" technique for retrofit use in existing neighborhoods. Many drivers ignore statutory and posted speed limits and, if the design of the road will allow them to do so, will drive at speeds exceeding those which suit the conditions prevailing in residential areas. Various physical devices have been developed to discourage this behavior; one (1) of these devices is the speed hump. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, 5-2-2011) 
10.20.020 - Definition of speed humps. 
    Speed humps are generally three (3) inches high, flat-topped or cylindrical raised sections of pavement, typically twelve (12) to twenty-two (22) feet in length in the direction of travel. The ends of a speed hump are tapered to be flush with the street at the curb and gutter to allow water to drain. Speed humps are spaced roughly two hundred fifty (250) to seven hundred fifty (750) feet apart, and have been proven to work by creating a vertical displacement of the vehicles traversing them. It should be noted that speed humps are not the typical speed "bump" frequently seen in parking lots. 
    Installation of speed humps must strictly adhere to approved designs. A typical flat-top-profile speed hump design is shown in Figure 1. Flat-top speed humps have been used successfully to diminish speeds on roads with high volumes. A typical cylindrical or "Watt's Profile" speed hump design is shown in Figure 2. Watt's Profile speed humps are generally limited for use on roadways with volumes no greater than three thousand (3,000) vehicles per day (vpd). In addition, advance warning signs must always be used in conjunction with speed humps; appropriate signing for flat-top speed humps is shown in Figure 1, while the typical signing for the Watt's Profile humps is shown in Figure 2. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, 5-2-2011) 


10.20.030 - Engineering criteria. 
A.  Alternative traffic management strategies should always be pursued before the decision is made to install speed humps. These strategies include: 
1.  Reviewing, establishing, and/or revising and enforcing general laws and ordinances pertaining to speed limits and other traffic control management items; 
2.  Educating residents and neighborhood groups so they can better understand causes of traffic problems, potential solutions to these problems, and the advantages and disadvantages of implementing different solutions; 
3.  Installing specific regulatory, warning, and guide message signs or other traffic control devices. 
    Speed humps are an effective and appropriate device for safely reducing vehicle speeds on certain types of streets when all of these other speed control alternatives have been investigated and determined to be ineffective. In order for speed hump installations to be effective, they should be located selectively in accordance with defined transportation engineering criteria. Proper installation will also minimize driver frustration and encourage safe driving practices. 
B.  If a location fails to meet any of the following criteria, the placement of speed humps should not be recommended. 
1.  Operational Criteria. 
a.  The functional classification of the roadway is a local or major local street. 
b.  Average weekly daily traffic (AWDT) volumes on the roadway segment are less than three thousand (3,000) vpd. 
c.  The posted speed limit of the roadway segment is twenty-five (25) miles per hour (mph) or less. 
d.  The eighty-fifth percentile speed measured on the roadway segment exceeds the posted speed limit by ten (10) mph or more. This criterion may be waived for dead-end streets. 
2.  The roadway segment is fronted by primarily (more than fifty (50) percent) residential land uses. 
3.  Geometric Criteria. 
a.  The roadway has a vertical grade of eight (8) percent or less. 
b.  The roadway segment is paved. 
c.  The roadway segment has only one (1) moving lane of traffic in each direction. 
d.  The section length is greater than or equal to two (2) blocks or one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet. 
e.  The width of the street is greater than eighteen (18) feet. 
C.  The following general conditions should also be considered when installing speed humps: 
1.  Motorists should have adequate sight distance to react to speed humps. 
2.  Speed humps should not be placed over manholes, gate valves, utility vault accesses or other similar features. 
3.  If a drainage inlet is near where a speed hump would be placed according to the general spacing criteria, an attempt should be made to locate the hump just downstream of the inlet. 
4.  Speed humps should be placed to take advantage of existing street lighting. 
5.  Speed humps should not be placed in front of driveways. 
6.  Speed humps should be placed at property lines, if possible, rather than directly in front of a residence. 
7.  Speed humps are placed perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
8.  Speed humps should not be placed within an intersection. 
9.  Speed humps should not be placed within a horizontal curve. 
10.  When curbs are not present, alternate means should be provided to discourage motorists from driving around the speed hump (Figure 3). 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, 5-2-2011) 

10.20.040 - Neighborhood support. 
    Property owners on the roadway segment must be in concurrence with the placement of the speed hump(s) and will be allowed one (1) vote of record. Concurrence will be indicated by the signing of a petition to the City of Belen. A minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of lot owners supporting the placement of speed humps in the petition area must sign in order for the petition to be considered. The petition will clearly state that those signing the petition would accept all warning signs and restricted parking associated with the placement of the speed hump(s). 
    Prior notification and written comments must also be obtained from the local fire, rescue, and police departments, as well as the transportation provider for the local public schools. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, 5-2-2011) 
10.20.050 - Prioritization and implementation. 
A.  The City of Belen will prioritize pending projects on a fiscal year basis by assigning points to each project. Projects will be scheduled for detailed design and implementation based on their point scores and the capital improvement funds available for the fiscal year. Points will be assigned as follows: 
1.  Speed. Two (2) points will be assigned for every one (1) mph that the eighty-fifth-percentile speed is above the speed limit for the roadway. 
2.  Pedestrian Activity and Facilities. Ten (10) points will be assigned if the street has no sidewalks; five (5) points will be assigned if the street has sidewalks on only one (1) side or has discontinuous sidewalks. In addition, ten (10) points will be assigned for each pedestrian generator along the roadway section, for instance, a school playground, or park, and five (5) points will be assigned if the street is designated as an on-road bike route. 
3.  Street Width. Five (5) points will be assigned if the combination of street width and parking characteristic results in areas of single lane, alternating flow. 
B.  The street yielding the highest numerical point score will be considered to have the highest priority. The street with the earliest application date will have the highest priority among streets with the same point score. 
C.  When a budgeted amount for speed humps has been approved, the City of Belen will, starting at the top of the ranking list and proceeding in descending order, determine which installations will be funded from the budgeted amount. Representatives of the applicants for all approved speed hump installations will be notified of which requests have been funded for the upcoming fiscal year. 
D.  As funding allows, preference shall be given to those roads qualifying for speed humps for which other improvements are already planned to be constructed.

The procedure for installation shall remain the same as outlined in this policy. Each case will be reviewed individually and a determination will be made based on consideration of emergency response, adjacent land uses, function in the transportation system, and safety. In all cases, should speed humps be installed, the speed humps will be removed when the roadway volume exceeds three thousand (3,000) vpd. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, 5-2-2011) 
10.20.070 - Speed hump installation procedure. 
A.  The initial request for the installation of speed humps must originate from a written petition indicating that a minimum percentage of the property owners in the petition area (per formula in section 10.20.040) support the installation of speed humps as provided in the speed hump policy. Only petition forms (Exhibit 2) supplied by the City of Belen or exact duplicates may be used for this purpose. 
B.  After verification of the petitions, the City of Belen will conduct the necessary transportation engineering studies and solicit comments and recommendations from other agencies. A determination of the street's eligibility for speed hump installation will then be made in a timely manner, based on all of the criteria of the speed hump policy as shown in the detailed engineering evaluation form (Exhibit 3). 
1.  If the roadway segment is determined not to be eligible, the applicant(s) will be notified in writing with the reason(s) for rejection being given. 
2.  If the roadway segment is determined to be eligible, the segment will be placed on a list of streets eligible for speed hump installation, subject to the availability of funding. 
C.  The City of Belen will annually prioritize pending projects on a fiscal year basis by assigning points to each project (Exhibit 4). Projects will be scheduled for detailed design and implementation based on their point scores and the capital improvements funds available for the fiscal year. 
1.  The street yielding the highest numerical point score will be considered to have the highest priority. The street with the earliest application date will have the highest priority among streets with the same point score. 
2.  When a budgeted amount for speed humps has been approved, the City of Belen will, starting at the top of the ranking list and proceeding in descending order, determine which installations will be funded from the budgeted amount. Representatives of the applicants for all approved speed hump installations will be notified of which requests have been funded for the upcoming fiscal year. If the required funding is not available, the petitioners may pay all estimated material and labor costs prior to installation. 
D.  The process for speed hump removal or alteration by residents is the same as the process for installation. 
E.  The City of Belen City Council reserves the right to install, remove, or alter any speed hump for the health, welfare, and safety of the public. 
F.  Speed humps recommended as part of a system level analysis to address traffic flow and control for a particular area of the City of Belen will not be subject to the provisions of this policy.

Chapter 11.08 - COMMERCIAL SERVICES AT MUNICIPAL AIRPORT 
Sections: 
Article I. - General Information on Minimum Standards for Airport Aeronautical Services 

11.08.010 - Preamble. 
    The airport manager of the city of Belen is the designated agent of the owner and in a position of responsibility for the administration of the Belen Alexander Municipal Airport. 
    In order to ensure adequate aeronautical services and facilities to the user(s) of the Belen Alexander Municipal Airport, and to encourage the development of the airport and its activity, and to foster the economic health and orderly development of commercial aeronautical operators at the airport, the city establishes the following minimum standards in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 150/5190-5, entitled "Exclusive Rights and Minimum Standards for Commercial Aeronautical Activities." 
    The minimum standards are intended to be the threshold entry requirements for those wishing to provide commercial aeronautical services to the public and to ensure that those who have undertaken to provide commodities and services as approved are not exposed to unfair or irresponsible competition. These minimum standards were developed taking into consideration the aviation role of the Belen Alexander Municipal Airport, facilities that currently exist at the airport, services being offered at the airport, the future development planned for the airport and to promote fair competition. The uniform application of these minimum standards, containing the minimum levels of service that must be offered by the prospective service provider, relates primarily to the public interest and discourages substandard entrepreneurs, thereby protecting both the established aeronautical activity and the Belen Alexander Municipal Airport. Off airport operators not meeting the off-site requirements will not be allowed. 
    Special Restrictions on Airport Land and Facility Use. No person shall be granted the right to conduct any commercial aeronautical activity upon the airport, nor shall any person be permitted to use any land or conduct any commercial aeronautical activity or the solicitation of business in connection therewith, unless such aeronautical activity is conducted in accordance with these minimum standards. 
    Herewith provide: 
A.  The minimum standards for a person or persons, firm or corporation based upon and engaging in one or more aeronautical services at the Belen Alexander Municipal Airport; 
B.  Requirements for all nonprofit aviation clubs based at the airport;

Where more than one activity is proposed, the minimum requirements will vary (dependent upon the nature of individual services in such combination) but will not necessarily be cumulative in all instances. Because of these variables, the applicable minimum standards on combinations of services will be discussed with the prospective operator at the time of application or, otherwise, during lease negotiations. 
Z.  All services provided will be done by the operator's employees or by an approved off-site operator meeting the standards for that category.

    Other definitions are as set out in NMSA 1978 Compilation, 3-39-17; and in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace. 
(Ord. 1981-5 § 2) 
11.12.030 - Zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of these regulations, there are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zone and conical zone. Such areas and zones are shown on the Alexander Municipal Airport zoning map consisting of one sheet, adopted by the city council and dated May, 1979, a copy of which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and made a part hereof. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
A.  Approach Zones. An approach zone is established at each end of all runways on the Alexander Municipal Airport for landings and take-offs. The approach zone shall be longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface and having a width of five hundred (500) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of two thousand (2,000) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet at a slope of twenty (20) feet horizontally to one foot vertically beyond each end of the runway. 
B.  Transition Zones. Transition zones are established adjacent to each runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline at a slope of seven feet horizontally to one foot vertically from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zones, or the conical zone. 
C.  Horizontal Zones. A horizontal zone is established as within the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of a radius of five thousand (5,000) feet from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach zones, conical zones, and the transition zones. 
D.  Conical Zones. A conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zones and extends outward therefrom at a slope of twenty (20) feet horizontally to one foot vertically for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. The conical zone does not include the approach zones and transition zones. 
(Ord. 1981-5 § 3) 
11.12.040 - Height limitations. 
    Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created by these regulations to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for each zone. Such height limitations are established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
A.  Approach Zones. One foot in height for each twenty (20) feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from and at the elevation of the end of the runway and extending to a point five thousand two hundred (5,200) feet from the end of the runway; 
B.  Transition Zones. One foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point two hundred fifty (250) feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of the runways extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end thereof, extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation which is five thousand one hundred ninety-three (5193) feet above the mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal, and conical surfaces; 
C.  Horizontal Zones. One hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or a height of five thousand three hundred forty-three (5343) feet above mean sea level; and 
D.  Conical Zone. One foot in height for each twenty (20) feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zones, extending to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation. 
    Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitations shall prevail. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to two hundred (200) feet above the surface of the land within a three mile radius of the airport reference point, except when such tree or structure intrudes within one of the restricted zones described above. 
(Ord. 1981-5 § 4) 
11.12.050 - Use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations, no use may be made of land within any zone established by these regulations in such manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking-off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(Ord. 1981-5 § 5) 
11.12.060 - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  Regulations Not Retroactive. These regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, nor otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and is diligently prosecuted. 
B.  Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city council to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the owner of the nonconforming tree or structure, and shall conform to the current Federal Aviation Administration, Advisory Circular 70/7460-1. 
(Ord. 1981-5 § 6) 
11.12.070 - Permits. 
A.  Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (A)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of the land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
1.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone but not within the limits of an approach zone or transition zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than one hundred fifty (150) feet of vertical height above the ground except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone. 
2.  In the areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than fifty (50) feet of vertical height above the established airport elevation, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such instrument or noninstrument approach zone. 
3.  In the areas lying within the limits of the conical zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zones, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than one hundred fifty (150) feet of vertical height above the ground except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic feature would extend above the height limit prescribed for such conical zones. 
    Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by these regulations except as set forth in Section 11.12.040. 
B.  Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
C.  Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the city council determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
D.  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his or her property, not in accordance with these regulations, may apply to the city council for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations. 
E.  Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to carry out the purpose of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or trees in question to, at his or her own expense, install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
(Ord. 1981-5 § 7)

13.04.120 - User fees. 
A.  Establishment of Equitable User Fees. The governing body of the city shall take the necessary steps to establish an equitable system of user fees. The purpose hereof is that each individual user shall pay an equitable portion of the city's cost of owning the wastewater facilities plus an equitable portion of the total operation and maintenance costs. 
B.  Fee Computation for Single-Family Homes within City Limits. For single-family homes, the user fees shall be computed as follows: 
UC= A + (K)(V) 
Where UC = Monthly user charge fee in dollars per month 
A = Fixed charge in dollars per month for being connected to the sewer system whether or not any wastewater is discharged to the system and for which up to three thousand (3,000) gallons per month of water may be discharged to the sewer system. 
K = Basic charge in dollars per month made per thousand gallons of water used per month above the three thousand (3,000) gallons per month allowed by paying the fixed charge. 
V = Volume of water used per month in thousands of gallons above the three thousand (3,000) gallons per month allowed by paying the fixed charge; based on the average water consumption for the months of October through February, inclusive, and becoming effective for each user for a twelve (12) month period beginning with the city's billing for the month of January; if actual water use measurements are not available, this value shall be established by the city on the basis of expected water use for the building being served. 
C.  Fee Computation for Other Users within City limits. For all other users, the user fees shall be computed as follows: 
UC = A + (K)(V) 
Where UC, A, V, and K are as previously defined. 
V = Volume of water used per month in thousands of gallons above the three thousand (3,000) gallons per month allowed by paying the fixed charge; if actual water use measurements are not available, this value shall be established by the city on the basis of expected water use for the building(s) being served. 
D.  Fees for Single-Family Homes and Commercial Properties Outside City Limits. For single-family homes and commercial properties, the user fees shall be computed as follows: 
1.  A fee will be charged based on the current adopted rate, per residential grinder pump. This will also be used as a calculation when the property is not connected to a city water line. 
2.  A fee will be charged based on the current adopted rate, per commercial grinder pump. This will also be used as a calculation when the property is not connected to a city water line. 
E.  Fees for Other Users Outside City limits. For all other users, the user fees shall be computed as follows: 
1.  For institutional and industrial properties, a fee will be charged using the current adopted rate, using calculations based on the estimated water usage and institutional population. This will also be used as a calculation when the property is not connected to a city water line. 
F.  Industrial Surcharge. A surcharge will be assessed against persons discharging industrial liquid wastes which are of a greater strength than normal, untreated domestic wastewater. Normal untreated domestic waste-water is defined as having a maximum yearly average chemical oxygen demand not in excess of four hundred (400) milligrams per liter and a settleable solids level not in excess of 5.0 milliliters per liter. The monthly industrial surcharge shall be computed from the following formulation: 
SR = (Vi) Kss (SS-5) + K COD (COD-400) 5 400  
Where SR = Surcharge in dollars per month; such surcharge being in addition to the monthly user charge. 
Vi = Volume of water used per month in thousands of gallons. 
Kss = Charge in dollars per month made per thousand gallons of water used for wastes of normal settleable solids concentration. 
K COD = Charge in dollars per month made per thousand gallons of water used for wastes of normal COD concentration. 
SS = Settleable solids concentration of the industrial waste in milliliters per liter; shall not be less than five for computation of the surcharge. 
COD = COD concentration of the industrial waste in milligrams per liter; shall not be less than four hundred (400) for computation of the surcharge. 
Kss and K COD shall be computed by the city to reflect the city's estimation of the respective costs of treating the settleable solids and COD components of normal wastewater. To compute Kss and K COD, the following formula shall be utilized: 
K= Kss + KCOD + Kv 
Where K, Kss, and K COD are as previously defined. 
Kv = The estimated portion of K which may be attributed to the processing of a thousand gallons of wastewater independent of treatment or renovation of that wastewater. 
E.  Access of City to Water Utility Records of User. For the purpose of assessing equitable user fees, any person discharging wastes to the sanitary sewers shall permit access by the city to water utility records for that person's property.

13.08.060 - Industrial liquid waste disposal permit. 
    Before any person shall discharge any industrial liquid waste into a main line sewer maintained by the city such person shall obtain from the city manager a revocable industrial waste permit for each industrial connection sewer. This requirement shall not become effective, however, until six months after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
    Any person desiring to discharge industrial liquid waste into a main line sewer maintained by the city, shall file an application for such a permit with the city manager on a form to be furnished by the city. In his or her application such person shall set forth such information as to the kind and size of the industrial operation producing such industrial liquid waste, the quantity and characteristics of such waste, detailed plans for any pretreatment facilities planned to prevent discharge of improper materials into the sewer, together with such other information as may be required by the city manager. 
    If the city manager finds from the application and from such other investigation as the city manager desires to make or cause to be made, that the quality of the industrial liquid waste and the facilities for discharge into the sewer conform to this chapter, the provisions of this code and other applicable statutes; that any required pretreatment facilities have been constructed in accordance with approved plans and the applicable statutes and ordinances, and that the main line sewer capacity will handle the sewage flow, the city manager may issue such revocable permit. The revocable industrial liquid waste permit so issued shall state the nature of the industrial liquid waste, the nature and amount of the flow which the permittee may discharge into the main line sewer and such other conditions and restrictions as the city manager may deem necessary in order that the public sewer may serve its intended purpose. 
(Ord. 355 § 6, 1972) 
13.08.070 - Industrial liquid waste discharge requirements. 
    The city manager may require that all industrial liquid waste discharged into a public sewer maintained by the city be routed through a manhole or sampling compartment which shall be constructed and maintained by the person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit is issued. The design of such manhole or sampling compartment shall meet with the approval of the city manager. The manhole or sampling compartment shall be available and accessible at all times to the city manager or other persons authorized by law to make such inspections. The piping to and from the manhole or sampling compartment shall be arranged so that observations may be made of all of the industrial liquid waste flow prior to mixture with domestic sewage so that the industrial liquid waste flow may be plugged off without impeding the flow of domestic sewage. 
    The city manager may require the person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit has been issued, to install a measuring device so that the measurement of the flow may be made. If there is a possibility of the industrial liquid waste consisting of low pH acid waste the city manager may require the installation of pH recording equipment, the record shall be submitted to the city manager. The city manager may require a person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit is issued to provide at his or her own expense for inspection of the quality of the industrial liquid waste or performance of industrial liquid waste pretreatment facilities by an impartial third party, which party shall meet the approval of the city manager. Such third party shall furnish to the city manager a signed copy of such report. The city manager may require a person to whom an industrial waste permit is issued to report to him or her from time to time the nature and amount of materials processed by the industry and such other information as the city manager may find necessary to evaluate the effect of industrial liquid waste on the public sewer. 
(Ord. 355 § 7, 1972) 
13.08.080 - Pretreatment. 
A.  Persons or owners discharging industrial wastes which exhibit any of the prohibited wastes set out in Section 13.08.030 shall pretreat or otherwise dispose of such industrial wastes to make the remaining waste acceptable to the city water utilities. 
B.  Persons or owners discharging industrial wastes which exhibit none of the characteristics of wastes prohibited in Section 13.08.030 other than excessive B.O.D. or suspended solids but having a concentration for a duration of fifteen (15) minutes greater than four times that of "normal" sewage as measured by suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand (B.O.D.) or a concentration during a twenty-four (24) hour period average of suspended solids or B.O.D. content in excess of "normal" sewage as defined in Section 13.08.020 as "normal" domestic sewage shall be required to pretreat the industrial wastes to meet the requirements or "normal" sewage; however, such wastes may be accepted for treatment if all the following requirements are met: 
1.  The wastes will not cause damage to the collection system. 
2.  The wastes will not impair the treatment processes. 
3.  The donor of the wastes enters into a contractual agreement with the city providing for a surcharge over and above published water and sewer rates. The basis for surcharge on industrial wastes is a capital and operating cost of $0.096/parts per million/million gallons, for the suspended solids and B.O.D. (biochemical oxygen demand) exceeding "normal" sewage, such rate to continue until changed by action of the city council. 
    Any person who refuses to comply with, or who resists or willfully violates this section, or who refuses to comply with the provisions of this section, shall be served by the city manager with a written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for satisfactory correction thereof. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit shall be guilty of violation of his or her service contract and shall be summarily disconnected from the sanitary sewer and/or water service, such disconnection and reconnection to be at total expense to the customer. Where acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment processes are released to the sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures or interfering with proper treatment of sewage, the city manager is authorized to immediately terminate service by such measures as are necessary to protect the facilities. 
(Ord. 355 § 8, 1972) 
13.08.090 - Control chambers. 
    Within one year from the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, any person discharging or desiring to discharge an industrial waste mixture into the sewers or sewer works of the city, or any sewer connected therewith, shall provide and maintain in a suitable accessible position on his or her premises, or such premises occupied by him or her, an inspection chamber, or manhole, near the outlet of each sewer, drain, pipe, channel or connection which communicates with any sewer or sewer works of the city, or any sewer or sewer works of the city, or any sewer connected therewith. 
    Every such manhole, or inspection chamber, shall be of such design and construction as to prevent infiltration by ground and surface waters or introduction of slugs of solids by the installation of screens with maximum openings of one inch but of sufficient fineness to prevent the entrance of objectionable slugs of solids to the sanitary sewer system, and shall be so maintained by the person discharging wastes so that any authorized representative or employee of the city may readily and safely measure the volume and obtain samples of the flow at all times. Plans for the construction of control manholes, or inspection chambers, including such flow measuring devices as may be required by this chapter, shall be approved by the city manager prior to the beginning of construction. 
(Ord. 355 § 9, 1972) 
13.08.100 - Volume of waste. 
    When the public water supply is used exclusively, the water consumption during the previous month, as determined from the meter records of the water utilities department, shall be the valid basis for computing a sewage flow, unless actual sewage flow is measured by a recording meter of a type to be approved by the city manager. The owner shall maintain such device in proper condition to accurately measure such flow. Upon failure to do so, the water consumption shall be basis for charges. 
    In cases where all or part of the water consumed is obtained from private supplies, well, etc., such person shall provide and maintain at all times suitable metering devices, approved by the city manager, in connection with all sources or private water unless the control manhole provided for in the preceding section shall be equipped with an approved volume measuring device. The volume of private water consumed during the previous month, together with the consumption of public water as determined from the records of the water utilities department, shall be the basis for computing the sewage volume, or the owner may install at his or her expense an approved metering device to accurately measure sewage flow as before mentioned. 
    When water is contained in a product, or is evaporated, or is discharged as unpolluted waste in an uncontaminated condition to surface drainage, an application may be made for a reduction in the volume of waste discharged to the public sewer; provided, that supporting data satisfactory to the director is furnished. This data shall include a flow diagram, destination of the water supply or wastes, supported by submetering data installed on such process piping at the expense of the private owner. 
(Ord. 355 § 10, 1972) 
13.08.110 - Sampling of wastes. 
    Sampling of the effluent or waste discharges may be accomplished manually or by use of mechanical equipment to obtain a composite sample which would be representative of the total effluent. Samples shall be taken at intervals to be established by the contractual agreement between the owner and the city manager, or at such intervals as determined by the city manager as necessary to maintain a control over the discharges from the establishment. The method used in the examination of all industrial wastes to determine suspended solids, B.O.D. and prohibited wastes shall be those set forth in Section 13.08.060. 
(Ord. 355 § 11, 1972) 
13.08.120 - Revocation of industrial liquid waste and waste water disposal permits. 
    If the city manager finds that the person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit or a waste water disposal permit has been issued has not complied with the provisions of the permit, or has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of this code, or other applicable ordinances or statutes governing the discharge of industrial liquid waste or waste water into a main line sewer or such person supplied false or misleading information in his application or if the discharge of industrial liquid waste or waste water into a main line sewer causes a nuisance in the operation of a main line sewer, the city manager may give such person a thirty (30) day notice, in writing, specifying the manner in which such person has failed to comply with the provisions of the permit, or the manner in which the discharge constitutes an unreasonable burden in the operation of a main line sewer. If such person within the time specified in the notice does not remedy the condition, or conditions, specified in the notice, the city manager may revoke said permit and cause to be capped the industrial liquid waste outlet or the waste water outlet so that industrial liquid waste or waste water will not be discharged into a main line sewer. 
(Ord. 355 § 12, 1972) 
13.08.130 - City manager to enforce. 
    The city manager shall enforce all of the provisions of this chapter and for such purpose shall have all of the powers of a peace officer. Such powers shall not limit or otherwise effect the powers and duties of the city health officer or other persons authorized by law to make inspections. 
(Ord. 355 § 13, 1972) 
13.08.140 - Right of entry of city employees. 
    The city manager and other duly authorized employees of the city acting as his or her duly authorized agent and bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to gain access to such properties as may be necessary for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 355 § 14, 1972) 
13.08.150 - Maintenance of plants, interceptors and other facilities. 
    The requirements contained in this chapter covering the maintenance of sanitary sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping plants, industrial liquid waste pretreatment plants, interceptors or other appurtenances shall apply to all such facilities now existing or hereafter constructed. All such facilities shall be maintained by the owners thereof in a safe and sanitary condition and all devices or safeguards which are required by this chapter for the operation of such facilities shall be maintained in good working order. This section shall not be construed as permitting the removal or nonmaintenance of any device or safeguards or existing facilities unless authorized in writing by the city manager. 
(Ord. 355 § 15, 1972) 
13.08.160 - Reimbursement for cost of disconnection. 
    If an industrial connection, sewer or a connecting sewer through which waste water is disposed, has been disconnected from the public sewer by the city manager or the director of public service for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter, any applicant requesting permission to reconnect such industrial connection sewer or connecting sewer to the public sewer shall pay the city manager the reasonable cost of making such disconnection. The cost shall be determined by the city manager and the city manager may require the installation of a manhole for the purpose of measuring the flow or making periodical tests of the waste passing through such connection. 
(Ord. 355 § 16, 1972) 
13.08.170 - Costs recovery system. 
A.  The following costs recovery system is herewith considered reasonable and acceptable for charges of sewage rates herein and shall be based on a basic rate for wastes, which do not exceed the concentration of "normal" domestic sewage (with respect to B.O.D. and SS), plus a surcharge for wastes which exceed the concentration of "normal" sewage. The industrial charge as above shall be calculated with the following formula, to-wit: 
IC = JV+V a(BOD-200*) + (SS-200*) 
B.  Definitions for Computation. The following constitutes definitions for the above formula: 
IC - Industrial charge. 
V - Volume discharge in millions of gallons. 
J - Basic rate (dollars per million gallons treated) 
a - BOD surcharge factor (dollars per million gallons per milligram per liter) based on the treatment costs attributable to the removal of BOD. 
BOD - Five-day @ 20 C BOD of the industrial wastes (mg/l) to be measured at intervals from composite samples. 
b - SS surcharge factor (dollars per million gallons per milligram per liter) based on the treatment costs attributable to the removal of SS. 
SS - Suspended solids of the industrial waste (mg/l) to be measured at intervals from composite samples. 
(Ord. 355 § 17, 1972) 
13.08.180 - Penalty for failure to pay bills. 
    The schedule of changes and charges for disconnection provided for in this chapter shall be deemed an essential part of any service rendered by the water utilities department. Failure to pay the monthly bills when due or failure to pay the established pro rata fee or charges for sanitary or water installations when due, or repeated discharge or prohibited wastes to the sanitary sewer, shall be sufficient cause to disconnect any and all services to the water mains of the water utilities department, and the same penalties and charges provided by the provisions of this code and other ordinances of the city for failure to pay the bills for water service when due shall be applicable in like manner in case of failure to pay the established charge for sanitary sewer service as herein provided.

Chapter 15.14 - VACANT OR FORECLOSED STRUCTURE REGISTRATION 

15.14.010 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known as cited as the city of Belen Vacant or Foreclosed Structure Registration Ordinance. 
(Ord. 2013-02) 
15.14.020 - Purpose. 
    Due in large part to current economic conditions, mortgage fraud, foreclosures and increased bankruptcies, certain properties have become vacant, unsupervised and are not being maintained. This, in turn, leads to an increased instance of unsecured or open windows and doors, broken water pipes, theft of metals and other materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds, shrubs and bushes, illegal dumping, and vermin activity at and around such structures. In many cases, the interiors of the structures have been damaged by the former occupants or trespassers. Unsupervised vacant properties have a negative impact on surrounding properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located. Owners of such properties are often difficult to locate or contact for various reasons, including the fact that the ownership may change either by act of the owner(s), financing agencies or lien holders. The ability of the city of Belen to fulfill its obligations to the citizens of Belen is enabled where the city of Belen has the current name, address, and telephone number for persons or entities holding an interest in vacant or foreclosed properties.

    "Ordinance 1012-06: Property Maintenance Code: IPMC" means the current edition of the International Property Maintenance Code, as published by the International Code Council, as it exists at the time of the adoption of this chapter or as it may be amended in the future by the International Code Council. 
    "Ordinance 2012-2" means appendix A, rate and fee table. 
    "Owner" means any owner by way of a fee interest, any lien interest claimant, any holder of an ownership interest by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or any mortgage property servicing group being compensated to manage the property, or any real estate management person or entity being compensated to manage the property. 
    "Planning and zoning" means the department or division of the city of Belen charged with matters pertaining to planning and zoning for the city of Belen. The code enforcement officer shall include in the file, pertaining to any property, a written record of any information received from any source pertaining to the history, problems, status or impact on the community of Belen of the status of any property.

Chapter 15.24 - CITY HOUSING POLICY 
Sections: 

15.24.010 - Adopted. 
    The following housing policies are adopted: 
A.  The city shall encourage the development of publicly funded housing for low-income people as defined by H.U.D. or publicly subsidized housing for low or moderate income people, henceforth referred to as low-income or subsidized housing projects, in scattered sites throughout the city and avoid locating them in areas of high numbers of low-income persons, or areas that have a high percentage of minority persons, unless housing is needed for replacement units or used as a move to upgrade the neighborhood in those areas. 
B.  The city shall not approve a proposed low-income or subsidized housing project of more than twenty-five (25) units at one site, except for elderly residents, in which case the total number of units cannot exceed seventy-five (75) in any one location, unless the project has been reviewed and passed affirmatively by the environmental planning commission, whose decision may be appealed to the council. 
C.  The city shall review design of proposed new construction of low-income or subsidized housing, and shall encourage flexibility and compatibility in design type and construction techniques. 
D.  All census tracts within the Belen city limits are acceptable for new construction of low-income or subsidized housing projects. Within acceptable tracts, individual sites not requiring a zone change will be reviewed and considered as any nonsubsidized housing development. If a zone change is required, it will be considered on the grounds of suitability of the site for residential use and requested density, not on the merits of a low-income housing project. 
E.  In designated redevelopment areas, existing housing shall be eligible for rehabilitation with public monies in accordance with the eligibility criteria for rehabilitation approved by the council as a part of the area redevelopment plan. 
F.  The site and neighborhood of all new subsidized and low-income housing projects shall be reasonably free from disturbing noises and reverberations and other hazards to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents, including adverse environmental conditions, natural or man-made. 
G.  The code enforcement program shall be administered equally in all areas of Belen. Because of the higher percentage of need in some areas, e.g., redevelopment neighborhoods, those areas may receive higher priority than another area, but in order to avoid occurrence of severe deterioration elsewhere, the code enforcement policies shall be equally administered.

Chapter 15.28 - FLOOD PROTECTION REGULATIONS[2] 
Sections: 
Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 2010-01, adopted May 17, 2010, repealed ch. 15.28 in its entirety and enacted a new ch. 15.28 as set out herein. The former ch. 15.28 derived from Ord. 1982-4, §§ 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 3.1-3.6, 4.1-4.4, 5.1, and 5.2. 

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

15.28.010. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of New Mexico has in Statutes Amended (NMSA) 1978 Section 3-18-7 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the governing body of the city of Belen, New Mexico, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. 2010-01, § 1.1) 
15.28.020. - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of Belen are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. 2010-01, § 1.2) 
15.28.030. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
G.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. 2010-01, § 1.3) 
15.28.040. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. 2010-01, § 1.4)

Chapter 16.08 - PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURES 
Sections: 

16.08.010 - Pre-application procedure. 
A.  Submission. All proposed subdivisions, replats or plat vacation shall comply with the requirements of these regulations. Whenever there is not a need for dedication of streets or easements, the council may waive the requirements for topography, street, utility, and/or storm drainage as set forth herein. However, submittal of a series of two-lot subdivisions on a tract of land will be considered a subterfuge to defeat the purposes of these regulations and such plats shall not be approved. 
    Previous to the filing of an application for approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the commission and city engineer a sketch plan and data as specified herein. This step does not require formal application, payment of fee, or filing of a plat with the council. 
B.  Advice. The pre-application procedure affords the subdivider the opportunity to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the commission and city engineer, early and informally before preparation of the preliminary plat and before formal application for its approval. The commission may assist the subdivider in analyzing the development and plan for its sound integration with the city, and may give informal guidance to the development at a stage when potential points of difference can be more easily resolved, thus simplifying official actions and saving unnecessary expense and delay to the subdivider. The city shall not be held liable for possible lack of understanding on the part of the subdivider. 
C.  Review. Within thirty (30) working days of sketch plan submittal, the commission, upon concurrence with the council, shall inform the subdivider whether the sketch plans and data meet the intent of these regulations. If the sketch plans and data do not meet the intent, the commission and council shall reject it and express the reasons therefor in writing. 
(Ord. 1993-3 § 9) 
16.08.020 - Plans and data for pre-application. 
A.  Location Map. A location map shall show the relationship of the proposed plat to existing community facilities which serve it; all abutting streets, shopping centers, schools, and parks; and north arrow. 
B.  Sketch Plan. A simple sketch plan on a current topographic survey shall show the proposed layout of street, lots, and other features in relation to existing conditions. The sketch plan may be a freehand pencil sketch made directly on a print of the topographic survey. 
C.  Written Information. General plat information shall list the name and address of the subdivider and his or her agent, if any, the total area of the proposed plat, the area of each proposed use, and a description of the existing conditions of the site and the proposed development as necessary to supplement the sketch plan. The information may include data on existing covenants and land characteristics including surface drainage, grading, landfill areas, and available private and municipal utilities. This information may also describe the subdivision proposal, such as the number and typical lot width and depth of residential lots, a business area, public areas, and proposed utilities.

Upon reaching a general understanding established by the preapplication review, the subdivider shall submit to the commission a written application on prescribed forms, together with the original and seven copies of the preliminary plat, improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified herein. The application package shall be submitted at least fourteen (14) days prior to the regular meeting of the commission at which time the plat is to be presented for review. 
B.  Review. The commission shall review the required preliminary plat and supplementary material and shall request comments from city staff, city engineer, and other governmental agencies as may be appropriate. 
C.  Annexation and/or Rezoning. If annexation and/or rezoning is proposed or required to accomplish the development envisioned in connection with the plat, the council shall withhold conditional approval of the preliminary plat until such time as annexation and/or rezoning shall be officially adopted by the council. The council shall have a written report available containing its recommendation prior to the public hearing on the annexation or rezoning. 
D.  Decision. Following review of the required preliminary plat and other material, and following negotiations with the subdivider on changes as may be deemed advisable, the council shall, within thirty-five (35) days of receipt of the application package act thereon as submitted, or modified. However, if the city engineer or any agency other than the staff of the city should be required to review the submitted materials, the time period within which the council must act may require reasonable extension. If an extension is granted, the council shall act on the preliminary plat within twenty-one (21) days after the last opinion requested of the city engineer or any agency is received. If this preliminary plat is approved, the council shall express its conditional approval and state the conditions of such approval, if any. If the plat is disapproved, the council shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefor. The action of the council shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any condition determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained by the council.

Chapter 16.24 - WATER RIGHTS 
Sections: 

16.24.010 - Transfer of water rights. 
A.  Requirement. An applicant for subdivision approval shall agree that if the city of Belen approved the subdivision, in consideration of that approval the applicant will make water rights available to the city in amounts as specified in this title. The applicant shall make these water rights available by transferring ownership and location of the water rights to the city in accordance with the rules and procedures of the state engineer of New Mexico. 
B.  Amount of Water Rights to be Transferred or to be Compensated for. The amount of water rights required for any subdivision shall be not less than 0.336 acre-feet per annum of consumptive use for each dwelling unit in the subdivision. Two exceptions to this amount of water rights are made: special provisions for water-conserving developments are discussed in subsection C; commercial development is discussed in subsection D. 
C.  Water Conservation. Applicants will be permitted to transfer fewer rights than specified in subsection B if they are able to demonstrate that the subdivision in question will serve fewer people; require less water; or have a higher return flow than a normal subdivision. Such demonstration shall be made in a formal report submitted to the city, which report will be reviewed by the city engineer or other expert, and any reduction in water rights requirements shall be determined by the city based on all available evidence. Under no circumstances shall a subdivider be allowed to transfer water rights in an amount which is less than 0.2 acre-feet per annum of consumptive use per dwelling unit. 
D.  Commercial and Industrial Development. Where a subdivision involves land for commercial or industrial purposes, in the opinion of the city may exceed three AFY of consumptive use, the city shall require that the applicant provide a report that describes the use of the property and estimates the total diversion and consumptive water use for all commercial or industrial purposes within each submission plat under conditions of full development. 
1.  If the total consumptive use for these purposes will be no more than three acre foot per year (AFY), no grant of water rights or compensation shall be due from the applicant to the city. 
2.  If the total consumptive use for these purposes will be in excess of three AFY, the city may require that all or a portion of consumptive use in excess of three AFY, be offset by transferring consumptive use rights to the city as provided by subsection A of this section. 
3.  If the applicant amends the commercial or industrial purpose within the subdivision, an amended report must be filed and consumptive use must be recalculated. 
F.  Transfers in Excess of Requirement. Where an applicant transfers more water rights than required, the applicant shall be given credit for water rights in an amount equal to the difference between the right transferred and the rights required. The applicant may use this credit in one of three ways. 
1.  The credit may be used to help meet the requirements of this section with respect to a different subdivision owned by the applicant. 
2.  The credit may be used to help meet the requirements of this section with respect to a different subdivision owned by a different applicant, if and when the original applicant so assigns the credit for whatever consideration he or she deems adequate. 
3.  The credit may be assigned to the city in which case the city will compensate the applicant at current fair market value. 
G.  Engineering Fees to be Paid by Applicant. Any and all engineering or other professional fees incurred by the city under this regulation shall be paid for by the applicant at the time they are incurred.

    Whoever shall subdivide land or commence construction on subdivided land or transfer ownership of any lot within subdivided land prior to the approval of any subdivision by resolution of the council and recordation in the office of the county clerk of Valencia County, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall forfeit and pay a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each lot so transferred or sold or agreed or negotiated to be sold. The city may enjoin such sale, transfer, or agreement to sell, by action for an injunction and may recover the said penalty through civil action. In addition to the above penalties, the city shall be entitled to recover its legal fees and costs for enforcement of these regulations. 
(Ord. 1993-3 § 5) 
16.28.020 - Character of development. 
    The commission shall confer with the subdivider regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision, and may agree with the subdivider as to certain minimum restrictions to be placed upon the property: (1) to prevent the construction of substandard buildings, and (2) to control the type and use of structures and the use of lots which, unless so controlled, would clearly depreciate the character and value of the proposed subdivision and of adjoining property. The council shall have power to agree with the subdivider upon the use, height, area or bulk restrictions governing building and premises, providing that in the case of subdivision beyond the corporate limits the council may require the subdivider to conform to the land-use plans adopted by the city. Deed restrictions and covenants shall not contain reversionary clauses wherein any lot shall return to the subdivider because of a violation of the terms of the restrictions and covenants. 
(Ord. 1993-3 § 18) 
16.28.030 - Modifications and exceptions. 
    Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape and/or surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of these regulations would result in real difficulties and substantial hardships, the council may vary or modify the requirements, so that the subdivider is allowed to develop his or her property in a reasonable manner, but at the same time so that the public welfare and interests of the city are protected and the general intent and spirit of these regulations are preserved. However, such relief may not be granted if it is detrimental to the public good or impairs the intent and purpose of these regulations or the desirable development of the community in accordance with plans and policies of the city. Any modification granted shall be entered in the records of the council setting forth the reasons which justified the modification. Further, in granting modifications and exceptions, the council may place conditions which, in its judgment, substantially secure the objectives of the standards or requirements involved.

If the public right-of way proposed for vacation is paved, or if the entire width of the right-of-way is proposed for vacation, the applicant shall post and maintain one or more signs, as provided, and where instructed by the council at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing. The applicant is responsible for removing such signs within five days after the hearing is completed. Failure to properly post signs is grounds for deferral of the request. No one except the applicant, the agent of the applicant, or the city shall remove or tamper with any such required sign during the period it is required to be maintained under this paragraph. 
c.  In consideration of the vacation of all or part of a public right-of-way, the commission shall determine whether or not the vacation will adversely affect the interests of persons owning contiguous land or land within the subdivision being vacated. 
3.  The rights-of-way of any public or private utility, including drainage, existing prior to the vacation, total or partial, of any plat are not affected by the vacation of a plat unless an authorized representative of the utility involved agrees in writing to have the rights vacated. 
C.  Public Hearing. A decision on approval and endorsement shall be made at a hearing by the council. Public notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city shall be published at least fifteen (15) days before the date of the hearing; the notice shall indicate the location of the proposed vacation, where a map of the proposed vacation may be viewed, and information on the hearing. If approved by the council, the statement of vacation is endorsed "approved." Such endorsement shall be within ten days of the conclusion of the hearing. 
D.  Recording. The vacation is in full force and effect only after the approved statement declaring the vacation has been recorded in the office of the Valencia County clerk and shall be requested to mark the original plat with the words "vacated" or "partially vacated" and refer on the plat to the volume and page on which the statement of vacation is recorded. Submittal for recording is the applicant's responsibility. The applicant shall also provide certified proof of the recording by the Valencia County clerk to the city manager.

Chapter 17.52 - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 

17.52.010 - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
A.  Within the districts established by this title, or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist: lots; structures; uses of land and structures; and characteristics of use which were lawful before the ordinance codified in this title was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this title or future amendment. It is the intent of this title to allow these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. 
B.  On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls; provided, that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of the passage of Ordinance No. 370 shall not be increased. Nothing in this title shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting public safety, on order of such official. 
C.  A nonconformity shall not be enlarged, expanded, or extended, but the addition of a lawful use to any portion of a nonconforming building which existed prior to the enactment of the ordinance codified in this title shall not be deemed an extension of such nonconforming use. 
D.  A single-family dwelling and any customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record preceding the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the minimum requirements for area or width, or both, that are hereafter applicable within the zoning district; provided that setback and any other requirements of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
E.  A nonconforming building may not be reconstructed or structurally altered during its life to an extent exceeding an aggregate cost of twenty-five (25) percent of the assessed value of the building unless said building is changed to a conforming use. No building damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its assessed value shall be restored or rebuilt except in conformity with the provisions of this title. 
F.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of ninety (90) days or more, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished, and any future use shall be in conformance with the provisions of this title. 
G.  Nothing in this title shall require any change in plans, construction, or designated use of a building for which a building permit has been issued prior to enactment of this title. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 11-16-2015) 
Chapter 17.54 - LANDSCAPE REGULATIONS 

17.54.010 - Intent of regulations. 
    The intent of these regulations is to provide visually attractive landscaping for commercial and industrial developments, to encourage the conservation of water through the use of drought-tolerant plantings and xeriscaping principles, to provide shade in pedestrian and parking areas, and to reduce the erosion of soils and contamination of surface waters caused by stormwater runoff.

(Ord. No. 2015-14, 11-16-2015) 
17.54.030 - Landscaping plan. 
    All applicants for a building permit for construction of new commercial or industrial development, or for expansion of existing commercial or industrial development applicable to these regulations, shall submit a landscaping plan with a required administrative review fee to the city planning and zoning officer who shall determine compliance with these regulations. The landscaping plan shall include: 
A.  A site map drawn to scale showing topography in the form of finished contour lines and areas proposed to be landscaped upon completion of the building construction project; 
B.  Common or botanical names of the plants to be used, indicating plant size, location and spacing shown on the site map;

(Ord. No. 2015-14, 11-16-2015) 
17.54.040 - Landscape requirements. 
    All landscaping created pursuant to these regulations shall be planned, designed, and installed in compliance with the following requirements: 
A.  A minimum of five (5) percent of the total site area shall be landscaped in a manner that will meet the intent of these regulations. Landscaping shall consist of trees, shrubs, ground-cover, or other low-growing plants, and may include natural or manufactured materials such as rocks, walls, pavements for walkways or patios, works of art, and outdoor furniture. 
B.  Drought-tolerant plantings are encouraged in all landscape designs. Upon request, the city planning and zoning officer will provide a list of drought-tolerant plants for the area to be landscaped. 
C.  To the extent possible, healthy existing trees and shrubs should be preserved, especially if drought-tolerant, and incorporated into the landscaped area. 
D.  Trees shall be planted as a landscape border along all abutting roadways and may be planted as an interior landscape border within vehicle parking areas. Spacing of trees in a landscape border shall be no greater than forty (40) feet apart. 
E.  Vegetation may be used to satisfy a screen requirement in accordance with this title to visually separate the land use on the commercial or industrial development site from an abutting residential land use. 
F.  Landscaping shall not create a physical or visual obstruction to vehicular traffic whether on or off public rights-of-way. 
G.  Placement of new trees shall avoid locations where future tree growth might interfere with utility lines or cause structural upheaval of pavements or buildings. 
H.  All landscape areas should make use of stormwater catchment and retention on site for purposes of flood control, water pollution abatement, prevention of soil erosion, and increased soil moisture for vegetation. On-site stormwater retention structures shall be designed to ensure public health and safety, during and following storm events. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 11-16-2015) 
17.54.050 - Maintenance standards. 
    All landscaping installed in compliance with these regulations shall be maintained as long as the commercial or industrial land use remains an active facility. The following maintenance standards are required: 
A.  Any plant material in areas of required new landscaping that does not survive will be replaced with an equivalent size and species of plant within three (3) months. 
B.  Plants shall be pruned as necessary to control size or shape, but not to endanger its health, in order to prevent visual and physical obstructions to pedestrians or vehicles. 
C.  Regular landscape maintenance should ensure water efficiency and include, but not be limited to, pruning, mulching, weeding, litter and dead plant removal, fertilizing, insect and disease control, and improvements or repair of nonvegetative materials. 
D.  Substantial modifications to landscaping will require review and approval of a revised landscape plan by the city engineer. Minor modifications of the landscaping occurring as a result of routine maintenance or replacement of vegetation because of damage or disease are not subject to approval by the city engineer. 
E.  Irrigation systems will be maintained and replaced as necessary to minimize loss of water due to leaks or inefficient use of water. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 11-16-2015) 
17.54.060 - Administrative review and fee. 
    These landscape regulations shall be enforced by the city planning and zoning officer who is authorized to review and approve landscape plans. Applicants for building permits to be granted by the city for commercial or industrial development shall confer with the city planning and zoning officer regarding the landscape requirements contained herein. An administrative fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be paid to the city to cover the landscape plan review costs. For complex and extensive landscape plans, the city planning and zoning officer may request an independent review of such plan by the city engineer or other qualified individual. Specific costs associated with an independent review of a landscape plan shall be paid to the city by the building permit applicant. All reviews of landscape plans shall be completed within thirty (30) days of receipt and documented with reasons given for approval or disapproval. Requests for variances or waivers to the requirements of these regulations shall be submitted to the city planning and zoning officer in writing. A variance or waiver may be granted or denied at the discretion of the city planning and zoning officer with reasons given in writing and returned within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request for variance or waiver. Any decision made by the city planning and zoning officer in carrying out the provisions of these regulations may be appealed to the Belen city council.

Chapter 17.58 - SIGN REGULATIONS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-07, adopted Nov. 7, 2016, repealed Ch. 17.58 in its entirety and enacted a new Ch. 17.58 to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 17.58, §§ 17.58.010-17.58.080, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2015-14, adopted Nov. 16, 2015. 

17.58.010 - Intent. 
    It is the intention of the city of Belen to allow such signs that will not endanger the public safety, will not obstruct or detract from visibility necessary for traffic safety, and will not conflict with the development policies and land use objectives set by the city of Belen. No sign shall be installed or maintained within the city of Belen unless such sign conforms to the regulations herein. Every sign shall be maintained in good structural condition at all times. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07, 11-7-2016) 
17.58.020 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this section, the following words, terms, and phrases shall apply: 
    "Advertising support structure" means any structural part of an advertising device. 
    "Billboard" means an advertising sign that is not physically located on the premises to which the sign refers. Billboards are also called off-premises signs. Advertising support structure without a sign face is regulated as a billboard. 
    "Building-mounted sign" means any sign attached to any part of a building, as contrasted to a freestanding sign. 
    "Freestanding sign" means a sign attached to an independent supporting structure which is not an integral part of a building. 
    "Interstate sign" means an on-premises sign within one thousand two hundred (1,200) linear feet in any direction of an interstate. 
    "Nonconforming sign" means any sign which does not conform to the regulations of this section upon the effective date of adoption or amendment thereto. 
    "On-premises sign" means a sign which advertises the primary goods or services sold or taking place upon the premises on which the sign is located. 
    "Portable sign" means a temporary sign which has removable lettering, usually mounted on wheels, and is not permanently attached to a building. 
    "Portable sign dealer" means a sign dealer in the business of renting portable signs to businesses or individuals and placed within the city. 
    "Residential sign" means any sign located in a district zoned for residential uses that contains no commercial message except advertising for goods or services legally offered on the premises where the sign is located, if offering such service at such location conforms with all requirements of the Belen zoning ordinance. 
    "Sign" means a device which is constructed to convey information visually to the public. A sign shall be construed to be a display surface or device containing organized and related elements composed to form a single unit. The size of signs shall be regulated according to the sign face. 
    "Sign face" means that area of the sign which is enclosed by a continuous line, connecting the extreme points or edges of the sign, but not including structural supports of the sign. For any two-sided sign on which both sign faces cannot be viewed at once, only one (1) sign face shall be counted in calculating the sign size. 
    "Temporary sign" means any sign that is used only temporarily and is not permanently mounted. 
    "Wall sign" means any sign painted on or applied directly onto the outside wall of a building and which displays only one (1) advertising surface. 
    "Wayfinding sign" means a sign that directs or guides pedestrian and vehicular traffic from point to point or confirms traffic is on a correct path to or have arrived at a location. An example would be a "finger point" sign that points an arrow in a certain direction and identifies what (specific businesses, points of interest) is located in that direction and is dual sided. 
    "Window sign" means any sign placed inside or upon a window facing the outside and which is intended to be seen from the exterior of a building; provided, however, that the total square feet of window sign shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of any of the window areas. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07, 11-7-2016) 
17.58.030 - Business signs. 
    The following regulations shall apply to all signs relating to business, commercial, industrial, institutional and service provider activities: 
A.  On-premises business signs shall be regulated as follows:

Title 18 - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS 
Chapters: 
Chapter 18.04 - APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

18.04.010 - General policies. 
A.  General Use. PIDs should be utilized primarily in connection with the financing of infrastructure for development of residential projects, master planned communities or substantial commercial development and redevelopment. PIDs may also be utilized to provide an enhanced level of public infrastructure amenities and/or municipal services. In order to avoid inefficient use of the limited resources of the city, unless otherwise agreed by the governing body, PIDs will not be approved to finance less than five million dollars ($5,000,000.00). The city's approval of a PID shall be based on an applicant's demonstration, to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, that the PID will provide benefit to the end-users of the PID-financed infrastructure or to the city which would not otherwise be available, which benefit may include, without limitation, additional amenities, services, increased quality of development or pricing benefits. A master planned development which has had a fiscal impact analysis which demonstrates that the cost of infrastructure delivery to the development will not have a net cost to the city will be deemed to have met the end-user benefit requirements of the city. Public improvements financed by a PID should conform to applicable city policies for development. Except as expressly agreed by the city based upon its determination that city-owned utilities will not be adversely affected, "stand alone" utilities which compete directly or indirectly with city services shall not be financed through PIDs. Real property dedications and conveyances required by existing city policies for development, growth management and conservation would remain in effect notwithstanding the establishment of a PID. The governing body may agree to participate in various projects depending on project type, location and cost when such factors have a clear benefit to the public. Public infrastructure proposed for the PID shall be concurred to by the governing body and must be of the type specified in the state statutes namely: 
1.  Sanitary sewage systems, including collection, transport, storage, treatment, dispersal, effluent use and discharge; 
2.  Drainage and flood control systems, including collection, transport, diversion, storage, detention, retention, dispersal, use and discharge; 
3.  Water systems for domestic, commercial, office, hotel or motel, industrial, irrigation, municipal or fire protection purposes, including production, collection, storage, treatment, transport, delivery, connection and dispersal; 
4.  Highways, streets, roadways, bridges, crossing structures and parking facilities including all areas for vehicular use for travel, ingress, egress and parking; 
5.  Trails and areas for pedestrian, equestrian, bicycle or other nonmotor vehicle use for travel, ingress, egress and parking; 
6.  Pedestrian malls, parks, recreational facilities and open space areas for the use of members of the public for entertainment, assembly and recreation; 
7.  Landscaping, including earthworks, structure, lakes and other water features, plants, trees and related water delivery systems; 
8.  Public buildings, public safety facilities and fire protection and police facilities; 
9.  Electrical generation, transmission and distribution facilities; 
10.  Natural gas distribution facilities; 
11.  Lighting systems; 
12.  Cable or other telecommunications lines and related equipment; 
13.  Traffic control systems and devices, including signals, controls, markings and signage; 
14.  School sites and facilities with the consent of the governing board of the public school district for which the site or facility is to be acquired, constructed or renovated; 
15.  Library and other public educational or cultural facilities; 
16.  Equipment, vehicles, furnishings, and other personally related to the items listed in this subsection; and 
17.  Inspection, construction management and program management costs. 
B.  Cost and Expenses-Reimbursement. Unless otherwise agreed by the city, all costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with (i) its review of a PID application; and (ii) the formation of a PID shall be paid by the applicant through advance payments as provided in this chapter. Costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with the application and formation of a PID shall not be a liability of the city. Costs and expenses shall include the costs of services rendered by city staff and services rendered by outside consultants who may be retained by the city including, but not limited to, bond counsel, financial advisers, engineers, appraisers, tax consultants and attorneys, at the rates normally charged by those consultants. If authorized by the PID, all or part of such costs may be reimbursed to the applicant from a PID tax levy, PID assessments, PID revenues or PID bond proceeds, provided that such reimbursement shall be in conformity with federal law, state law and these guidelines. Except as otherwise agreed by the city, PIDs will construct or finance improvements on such terms with such persons as the PID board of directors determines to be appropriate, in accordance with Section 5-11-10(D), of the Act as amended. Unless otherwise agreed by the city, all costs of administration and operation of the PID and the operation and maintenance of public infrastructure in the PID which has not been dedicated to and accepted by the city shall be the responsibility of the PID, the applicant, applicable homeowners' associations, or any combination of the foregoing, as may be acceptable to the city and the PID. 
C.  PID Boards of Directors-Delegated Authority. PIDs will initially be governed by a five-member board of directors appointed by the governing body which shall be composed of two full-time employees of the city, two persons selected by the applicant with the approval of the governing body, and a fifth member selected by the other four members. The governing body may, in accordance with law, delegate certain responsibilities of governance of PIDs to public officials employed by the city. Day-to-day responsibilities of PIDs will be performed by outside personnel pursuant to an agreement (including a PID development agreement entered into pursuant to Section 5-11-10(a)(2) of the Act), or the city staff (which development agreement may be denominated a "PID development agreement" or otherwise, at the parties' discretion, in order to avoid confusion with other development agreements entered into by the parties with respect to real property within the city). Each PID development agreement shall be in implementation of this chapter and upon execution by the city and the applicant shall supersede this chapter in the event of any conflict between this chapter and the development agreement. On a date not more than six years after the formation of a PID, new PID board members shall be elected or the governance of the PID shall revert to five members of the governing body, in accordance with the Act. 
D.  Self-Supporting-No Impact on City. Unless otherwise agreed to by the city, PIDs shall be self-supporting with regard to financing, operations and maintenance, and city funds will not be used for PID purposes. Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, neither the city's property, its full faith and credit nor its taxing power shall be pledged to the payment of any PID obligation or indebtedness. The amount and structure of debt of a PID shall not have any direct negative material impact on the city's debt ratings with Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Fitch Investor Services, Inc., or any other nationally recognized bond rating agency service then rating the city's outstanding bonds. 
E.  PID Development Agreement-Feasibility Reports. The amount, timing and form of financing to be used by a PID shall be determined by the PID board based upon a project feasibility report and established by agreement of the city, the PID and the applicant through a PID development agreement pursuant to Section 5-11-10(A)(2) of the Act. 
(Ord. 2007-04 (part))

The form and substances of the MAI appraisal shall be acceptable to the city, in its discretion. 
F.  Market Demand Study. To the extent applicable a market demand study for private development in the PID shall be prepared or reviewed and concurred in by an independent consultant acceptable to the city.

(Ord. 2007-04 (part)) 
18.04.040 - Application and approval process. 
A.  Application Submission. Ten copies of an application for the formation of a PID and an application fee of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) (the "application fee") shall be submitted to the city manager. 
B.  Application Fees. The application fee shall be utilized by the city for initial application review and project feasibility analysis, including the payment of the city's financial and legal advisors, at their customary rates, to assist in the evaluation of the feasibility of the proposed PID project. Five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) of the application fee shall be nonrefundable. The balance of the application fee shall be used by the city in connection with its review of the application. If the applicant withdraws its application prior to the city's completion of its application review, the city shall remit the unused portion (if any), of the application fee (but not the nonrefundable five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) portion) to the applicant. Upon the applicant's request, the city will provide an accounting of expenditures of funds advanced. Any unused portion of advances shall be refunded to the application at such time as the city determines that all costs and expenses have been paid. The city and its legal consultants shall use reasonable efforts to determine whether any features of a PID proposed in an application appear not to be feasible, and to advise the applicant early in the review process, for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary additional costs of review. 
C.  Post-Application Conference. After the application fee has been submitted, the city manager will arrange a conference with the appropriate PID review staff for the purpose of reviewing the application and determining whether the application is complete. If, following the application conference or any other time during the application process, PID review staff requests additional information, the applicant shall provide any and all supplemental information requested, in accordance with the provisions of subsection D of this section. 
D.  PID Review Staff Report. After analysis of an application is supplemented, PID review staff, under the direction of the city manager or his or her designee will prepare a report including recommendations relating to the PID, an analysis of the impact of the formation of the PID and its effects on the city. The report may provide a recommended disposition of the application and any additional requirements that are recommended in connection with the applicant and/or the PID. If all costs billed to or incurred by the city have been paid by the applicant by a date at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the meeting of the governing body at which the appropriate resolution(s) approving the application is to be introduced, and if the application meets the qualifications provided herein, the application, along with any report and recommendations by PID review staff, will be forwarded to the governing body, along with drafts of the appropriate implementing resolution(s). 
E.  PID Development Agreement. If the governing body preliminary approves an application for formation of a PID, the applying applicant and the staff of the city shall coordinate a schedule of events for the formation of the PID and shall negotiate an appropriate PID development agreement between the city and the applicant which shall be entered into in connection with the formation of the PID which, if approved by the governing body, shall incorporate the recommendations of the PID review staff relating to such PID, and any other restrictions, provisions and agreements required by the city. 
F.  Preliminary Approval. An applicant may request preliminary, nonbinding approval of its PID application by the governing body ("preliminary approval"). 
1.  A request for preliminary approval will be considered following payment of the initial application fee and information such as the following: 
a.  A description of the proposed PID's boundaries; 
b.  A description of the improvements to be constructed by the applicant; 
c.  The estimated construction costs of the improvements and anticipated completion time; 
d.  A description, by category, of improvements and related costs to be financed by the PID; 
e.  The estimated issuance amount of PID bonds; 
f.  The total annual special levy amount (i.e., estimated aggregate annual debt service on bonds); and 
g.  The maximum annual PID property tax or, in the case of a special levy, the allocation method and maximum special levy per dwelling unit (single-family residences) or per acre (multifamily and commercial), and method by which the levy will be allocated from bulk tract to finished lots. 
2.  The PID review staff report will advise the governing body whether preliminary approval is recommended, not recommended, or that no recommendation is made. 
G.  Additional Fees. An applicant that has received preliminary approval may be required to make such additional advances as the city staff determines are necessary to pay the costs of reviewing the applicant's request for formal approval of the formation of the PID based on a PID development agreement within the meaning of the Act. However, an applicant may be required to submit an additional initial application fee if, in city staff's determination, the application for formal approval of a PID departs substantially from the parameters set forth in the application for preliminary approval. 
H.  Approval of Formation and PID Financing. The governing body may consider the granting of formal approval to the formation of the PID development agreement that may be approved prior to or concurrently with the approval of the formation of the PID. The governing body may include in its approval of the PID formation the issuance of one or more series of PID bonds, subject to the terms and conditions of the PID development agreement. The governing body's approval of PID formation and issuance of bonds shall be conditioned on the requirement that the PID shall utilize bond counsel, underwriters and/or other consultants selected by or otherwise acceptable to the written approval by the governing body. 
(Ord. 2007-04 (part)) 
18.04.050 - PID operations and debt financing. 
A.  PID Administration Expense Fee. In addition to the amounts set forth in Section 18.04.040 upon formation of a PID the applicant shall deposit with the PID a nonrefundable administrative expense fee in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The administrative expense fee shall be applied by the PID to the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the formation, review of any feasibility study, election costs, administration, operation and maintenance of the PID or its public improvements. From time to time, upon depletion of the administrative expense fee, the PID, additional amounts deemed by the PID to be reasonably necessary for the purposes contemplated in this subsection. Nothing in this subsection preclude the reimbursement of such expenses from PID taxes, levies, charges or bond proceeds, as permitted by the Act. 
B.  Administration, Operation and Maintenance Charge. In order to provide for the PID to be self-supporting or its administrative, operation and maintenance expenses, and to finance services in addition to those provided by the city, the city may condition its approval of a PID, on the PID's imposition of up to three dollars ($3.00) per one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) of assessed value ad valorem tax, not as tax or charge of the city, but in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-11-23 of the Act, as amended, upon the PID taxable property which is not city-owned infrastructure otherwise maintained by the city; provided, however that, to the extent permitted by law the PID shall be entitled to charge such rates, fees, and charges to property owners as are necessary to address any shortfall in the expense required to operate and maintain the PID's improvements, and that such rates, fees and charges shall be established in the development agreement for the PID. 
C.  General Obligation Bonds. General obligation bonds of the PID will be payable from an unlimited valorem tax on taxable property located within the PID designated by the general plan for the PID as subject to the PID property tax, as required by the Act. 
1.  An applicant for general obligation bonds shall describe to the PID board of directors in a project feasibility report the following: 
a.  The current direct and overlapping tax and assessment burden on the taxable property that is proposed to be taxed and the fair market value and assessed valuation of the taxable property as shown on the most recent assessment roll; 
b.  The projected amount and timing of PID general obligation bonds to be used; 
c.  The projected market absorption of the development within the PID; 
d.  The effect of the PID bond issuance on PID tax rates, calculated as of the beginning, midway through and at the end of the marked absorption period or based on the phasing of the project to be financed, as applicable; 
e.  An estimate of the applicant's construction costs associated with the public improvements, in excess of the estimated PID-funded costs of the project; 
f.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID entering into a contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee of the bonds by the applicant. 
2.  The projected tax rate for debt service set forth in feasibility report shall be established in the PID development agreement, and may include provisions which (i) limit the maximum tax rate that will be imposed by the PID for payment of debt service on PID bonds, (ii) require a contribution agreement from the applicant for the payment of debt service in the event of a shortfall in revenue from the PID tax revenues projected in connection with, and all the time of, PID formation, or (iii) establish, to the city's satisfaction other protection for homeowners or other end-users of the property located in the PID against excessive tax rates in the event that PID indebtedness exceeds PID tax revenues available to pay debt service in any particular year. 
D.  Special Levy Bonds. Special levy bond shall be secured by a first lien (co-equal to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments) on the property benefited in the manner contemplated by Section 5-11-20(G) NMSA 1978. 
1.  Applicants for special levy bonds shall describe in each project feasibility report, the following: 
a.  The current direct and overlapping tax and assessment burden and special levy on real property to comprise the PID and the full cash value and assessed valuation of that property as shown on the most recent assessment roll; 
b.  The projected amount and timing of the PID special levy bonds to be issued; 
c.  The projected market absorption of development on the PID; 
d.  The projected special levy burden to be placed on the assessed parcels and the anticipated mythology of assessment; 
e.  An estimate of the applicant's construction cost associated with the public improvements in excess of the estimated PID-funded costs of the project; 
f.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID entering into a contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee of the bonds by the applicant; 
g.  The value to lien ratio, after the issuance of the bonds and construction of the improvements to be financed by the PID, will be at least three to one based on an MAI appraisal. 
2.  At the time the PID is formed, the maximum allowable rate of special levy for residential property shall not cause the total tax and assessment obligation for such property, including projected ad valorem taxes, special levies and special assessments, to exceed 1.99 percent of the anticipated market value of residential property as determined by a then current MAI appraisal. The 1.99 percent shall include all known and authorized, but unissued debt and any other anticipated fees or assessments which may be imposed by the city or special district on a property within the PID, i.e., special assessment districts, including the proposed maximum special levy, except service charges for utilities and refuse. 
E.  Revenue Bonds. Revenue bonds shall be payable from a PID revenue source. 
1.  An applicant for revenue bonds shall describe in each project feasibility report, the following: 
a.  The current fee structure for comparable services or otherwise incurred by persons who would be responsible for paying the proposed rates, fees, and charges; 
b.  The revenue source from which bonds will be payable. The city reserves the right to require the applicant to produce such independently prepared feasibility studies or reports as it deems necessary to confirm the amount and availability of revenues; 
c.  The projected market absorption of development within the PID; 
d.  The projected amount and timing of PID revenue bonds to be issued; 
e.  The financial impact of the proposed rates, fees, and charges on prospective residents or other users of such rates, fees and charges; 
f.  An estimate of the applicant's construction cost associated with the public improvements in excess of the estimated PID-funded costs of the project; 
g.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID shall enter into an as appropriate contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee of the bonds by the applicant. 
F.  Suitability. The city intends that the PID only have the power to sell the proposed bonds to suitable investors. If the proposed bond issue is not rated (either on its own merits or by the use of appropriate credit enhancement) in one of the three highest investment grade ratings issued by the Standards & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or any other nationally recognized bond-rating agency service, then the bonds must have minimal denominations of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) and be available for purchase and restricted with respect to resale to "Qualified Institutional Buyers" (as such term is defined in Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or to "accredited investors" (as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation d of the Rules Governing the Limited Offering and Sale Securities without Registration under the Securities Act of 1933). It is the intention of the city to have investor suitability achieved through the rating requirements set forth in the preceding sentence or the establishment of large minimum denominations (e.g., not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)) and, if the city determines it is appropriate, covenants limiting secondary market sales of PID bonds through registered broker-dealers. Notwithstanding the restrictions pertaining to public sales and private placements of bonds set forth in this section, the restrictions may be modified or relaxed if other financing structures or features are presented which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, provide other means to address investor suitability concerns. The minimum denomination requirements set forth above for the PID bonds which are initially issued without rating shall not continue to apply if the PID subsequently obtains a rating in one of the three highest rating categories as provided in this section. 
G.  Contribution. At the time the PID is formed financial projections must demonstrate that the landowners shall provide over the life of the project at least twenty-five cents ($0.25) in infrastructure or community improvement (which may include, for example, dry utilities and other improvements for the benefit of the property owners within the PID, irrespective of whether such improvements are publicly or privately owned) for each one dollar ($1.00) of debt to be issued by a PID to finance public infrastructure purposes, except as otherwise determined by the city in its discretion. The city, in its discretion, may condition approval of PID formation on additional financing requirements, including, without limitation, the deposit of cash, or letter of credit (or similar credit facility) as security for completion of the infrastructure development. If agreed to by the city or PID board, as applicable, in the discretion of the city of PID board, infrastructure and community improvement constructed or acquired by the applicant prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the formation of the PID may be included in calculating the applicants compliance with this subsection; provided, that no improvements which have not already been constructed or acquired shall be included in that calculation unless the completion of the improvements is guaranteed or secured by an appropriate completion bond, cash deposit or other security acceptable to the city or PID board, as applicable. 
H.  Debt Service Reserve Funds. If allowed by law (including any applicable federal laws relating to the tax exempt status of the bonds), all bond issues may include a debt service reserve fund in an amount acceptable to the PID board. 
I.  Environment Site Assessments. Unless otherwise provided to the city pursuant to the other requirements prior to PID financing and acquisition by the PID or city, the PID and city will require an independent environmental report or assessment of any real property which will be dedicated to or otherwise owned, leased or operated by the city or the PID and a proposed form or indemnity agreement with respect to all environmental law liability. 
J.  Refinancing and Refunding Bonds. Refinancing and refunding of bonds issued on behalf of a PID will be considered utilizing the same criteria set forth in this section and shall be subject to the review and approval of the governing body or its designee. Refinancing and refunding will be expected to either (1) generate interest rate or net present value savings; (2) restructure payment of principal; (3) reimburse the applicant for actual costs expended for public improvements contemplated to be part of the proposed project; or (4) eliminate burdensome covenants. 
K.  Cost of Change. Applicants shall be responsible for all additional costs and expenses incurred in any special levy or property tax modifications resulting from changes to the development not anticipated in the application. 
(Ord. 2007-04 (part)) 
18.04.060 - Miscellaneous. 
A.  Discretion and Waiver. Based upon the recommendations of PID review staff and/or financing legal consultants retained by the city, the governing body may approve the PID applications which do not meet the foregoing criteria, if the governing body, in its discretion, determines that the particular features of the proposed PID, likelihood that the PID's projects and purposes will be successfully completed and mechanisms protecting against default on bonds, warrant that the foregoing criteria need not be applied. In making that determination, the governing body may consider an opinion of an underwriter with a reputation satisfactory to the governing body that the particular features of the PID, the proposed projects and the bonds proposed to be issued can be successfully marketed and that the plan of finance is feasible. 
B.  Purchaser Disclosure-Marketing Materials. Each purchaser of real property located in the PID shall execute an acknowledgement of the PID disclosure form. The applicant shall also supply the city with a copy of the receipt. (Applicants are required to describe in their promotional material the financial and other relative impacts on the development being induced in a PID. Copies of the disclosure form must be placed on file with the city.) 
C.  Indemnity. The applicant (or such other third party acceptable to the city and the PID), shall indemnify the city and the PID and their agents and employees and shall hold the city and the PID and their agents, officers and employees harmless for, from and against any and all liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in any challenge or proceeding to the formation, operation, administration of the PID, the offer and sale of PID bonds, the levying by the PID of any tax, assessment, special levy or charge and the operation and maintenance of public infrastructure financed or owned by the PID. 
D.  Amendment. All amendments to this chapter shall have a prospective effect only and shall not in any way effect or otherwise modify the approval of preexisting PID.
