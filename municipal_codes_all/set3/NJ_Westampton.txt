Chapter 66
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 66-1. Statement of policy; violations.
§ 66-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
A. It is the policy of Westampton Township to maintain a working
environment that is free from discrimination, including sexual
harassment.
B. Sexual harassment is a form of misconduct that undermines the
integrity of the employment relationship. No employee, either male or
female, should be subjected to unsolicited and unwelcome sexual
overtures or conduct, either verbal or physical. No employee should be
subjected to a hostile or offensive working environment created by
sexual harassment.
C. Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a
socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome,
that is personally offensive, that lowers morale and that, therefore,
interferes with our work effectiveness.
D. Each supervisor has a responsibility to maintain a workplace free of
sexual harassment. This duty includes discussing this policy with all
employees and assuring them that they are not to endure insulting,
degrading or exploitive sexual treatment.
E. It shall be a violation of this policy for any employee of Westampton
Township to harass another employee through conduct or
communications of a sexual nature or because of that employee's
gender. It shall also be a violation of the policy for any supervisor who is
aware that sexual harassment is taking place to fail to promptly report
the matter to the Clerk/Administrator. [Amended 9-21-992 by Ord.
No. 10-1992]
Unwelcome sexual advance, requests for sexual favors and other
inappropriate verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature made by
any employee when:
Submission to sexual harassment is made, whether explicitly or
implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's employment.
(1)
Submission to or rejection of sexual harassment by an individual
is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting that
individual.
(2)
A.
§ 63-7 SEXUAL HARASSMENT § 66-2
66:59
§ 66-3. Procedures. [Amended 9-21-1992 by Ord. No. 10-1992]
Because of the nature and seriousness of sexual harassment in the
workplace, the receipt of complaints, investigation and recommendation for
disciplinary action, if necessary, shall be the responsibility of the Clerk/
Administrator.
Sexual harassment has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
(3)
"Sexual harassment" may include but is not limited to the following:
Unwelcome sexual advances, such as offensive sexual flirtations,
repeated requests for dates or love letters after rejection of
overtures.
(1)
(2) Discussing sexual activities.
(3) Pressure or coercion for sexual activity.
Repeated remarks to a person, with a sexual or demeaning
implication.
(4)
Unwelcome intentional touching, such as patting, pinching or
brushing against another's body.
(5)
Suggesting or demanding sexual involvement accompanied by
implied or explicit threats concerning one's evaluation, raise,
promotion, etc.
(6)
Displaying nude or pornographic pictures, lewd or vulgar cartoons,
etc.
(7)
(8) Practical jokes about gender-specific traits.
B.
"Sexual harassment" may also consist of intimidating, abusive or hostile
behavior of a nonsexual nature toward an employee because of his/her
gender. Verbal abuse and hostility that is not sexual in character but is
directed solely at females because they are female, or males because
they are male, for example, is likewise a violation of this policy on the
same level as harassment of a sexual nature.
C.
"Sexual harassment" can also take the form of offensive conduct by
nonemployees, such as vendors, outside contractors, etc., against
employees in the workplace.
D.
A. Reporting violations. Any person who feels he/she is the victim of sexual
harassment as defined herein may file a complaint directly with the
Clerk/Administrator. If any supervisory personnel receives a complaint
regarding sexual harassment, or becomes aware of instances of sexual
harassment, he/she shall promptly report the incident to the Clerk/
§ 66-2 WESTAMPTON CODE § 66-3
66:60
Administrator. There is no chain of command in relation to sexual
harassment complaints.
B. Investigation.
(1) The Clerk/Administrator shall promptly commence an investigation
of the allegations of sexual harassment, which may include
interviews and written statements from the victim, the alleged
harasser and any witnesses. The Clerk/Administrator may request
the assistance of counsel, other supervisory personnel or outside
sources in conducting the investigation. Confidentiality shall be
maintained throughout the investigation process.
(2) A written report of the investigation shall be prepared by the Clerk/
Administrator within three days of the conclusion of the
investigation, with a copy sent to the victim and alleged harasser.
C. Sanctions.
(1) If the allegations of sexual harassment are found to be meritorious,
the Clerk/Administrator shall immediately institute remedial and/or
corrective action, which may include counseling, change in work
assignments or disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Any disciplinary action shall be consistent with applicable
collective bargaining agreements. The victim of sexual harassment
shall be informed of the nature of any disciplinary action taken.
(2) The Clerk/Administrator may monitor future conduct of the parties
involved in order to reasonably ensure that the remedial action
taken has been effective in stopping the harassment and that no
retaliation has occurred.
D. Appeal. If any individual is aggrieved with the investigation, findings
and/or remedies pursuant to this policy, he/she may assert any right of
appeal contained in the applicable collective bargaining agreements,
file a complaint with the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights or pursue
any other civil remedy.
E. Notifications. This policy will be distributed to all employees of the
township. Every employee shall be required to certify that he/she has
received a copy of this policy.
F. Employee responsibility. It is the duty of all employees, including
supervisory personnel, to be familiar with this policy. More importantly,

§ 95-5. Bamboo planting prohibited; containment and removal.
[Added 5-16-2016 by Ord. No. 12-2016]
It is determined that certain types of the bamboo plant are invasive and
often difficult to control, and can and have caused significant damage
to properties. The purposes of this section are to preserve and protect
private and public property from the damaging spread of bamboo, to protect
indigenous and other plant materials from the invasive spread of bamboo
and to maintain the general welfare of the residents.
A. Prohibition. No owner, tenant or occupant of a property, or person,
corporation or other entity, shall plant, install or cause or permit the
planting or installation of plant species commonly known as "running
bamboo" upon any property. For the purposes of this section, "running
bamboo" means any bamboo in the genus Phyllostachys, including
Phyllostachys aureosulcata.
B. Duty to confine. In the event that any species commonly known as
"running bamboo" is located upon any property prior to the effective
date of this prohibition, the owner and occupant of said property shall
jointly and severally be required to confine such species to prevent the
encroachment, spread, invasion or intrusion of same onto any other
private or public property or public right-of-way. In lieu of confining the
species, the property owner or occupant may elect to totally remove the
bamboo from the property, and all affected properties. Failure to
properly confine such bamboo shall require removal as set forth below.
The cost of said removal shall be at the bamboo property owner's
§ 95-3 WESTAMPTON CODE § 95-5

expense. This duty to confine shall not apply if the property owner and/
or occupant can establish to the satisfaction of the Code Enforcement
Officer that the bamboo which is on his/her property at the time of the
adoption of this section originated on another property.
C. Removal.
(1) In the event that running bamboo is present on the effective date of
this prohibition and a complaint is received by the Township
regarding an encroachment of any bamboo plant or root, and the
Code Enforcement Officer of the Township after observation and/or
inspection determines that there is an encroachment or invasion on
any adjoining/neighboring private or public property or public
right-of-way (hereinafter, "the affected property"), the Township
shall serve notice to the bamboo property owner in writing that the
bamboo has invaded other private or public property(s) or public
rights-of-way and demand remediation of the encroachment of the
bamboo from the affected property, and demand approved
confinement against future encroachment. Notice shall be provided
to the bamboo property owner as well as to the owner of the
affected property by certified return receipt requested mail and
regular mail. Within 45 days of receipt of such notice, the bamboo
property owner shall submit to the Code Enforcement Officer, with
a copy to the owner of the affected property, a plan for the
remediation of the encroachment of the bamboo from the affected
property, which plan shall include restoration of the affected
property after remediation of the encroachment. Within 120 days of
receipt of the Code Enforcement Officer's approval of the plan of
remediation and restoration, the remediation and restoration shall
be completed to the satisfaction of the Code Enforcement Officer.
(2) If the bamboo property owner does not accomplish the remediation
of the encroachment from such other private or public property or
public right-of-way in accordance herewith, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall cause a citation to be issued with a penalty up to $100
for each day the violation continues, enforceable through the
Municipal court of the Township of Westampton. The
Administrative Officer may request, and the Municipal Court may
grant, a specific performance remedy. The Township may also
institute civil proceedings for injunctive or civil relief.
(3) Nothing herein shall be interpreted as limiting the rights of a
private property owner to seek civil relief through a Court of proper
jurisdiction, nor the institution of civil proceedings against the
property parties.
(4) When an encroachment is upon public property or public right-ofway
and the bamboo property owner and/or occupant has not
complied with the written notice provided as set forth above, the
Township of Westampton, at its discretion, may remove or contract
for the removal of such bamboo from the Township property or

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization; Findings of Fact; Purpose and Objectives
§ 131-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Township Committee of the Township of
Westampton of Burlington County, New Jersey does ordain as follows:
§ 131-2. Findings of fact.
§ 131-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Township of Westampton are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and

usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
§ 131-6. Terms defined.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AH ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone.
AO ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Official's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH Zone on a
community's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) with a one-percentannual
or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. It is shown on the FIRM as Zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO, A1-A30,
AE, A99, or AH.
BASE FLOOD  A flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS), including the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). For zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, the elevation represents
the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
§ 131-5 FIREARMS § 131-6
124:139
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or
storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood
hazard.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM)  The official map
on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the
areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building built, in the case of a
building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated
floor elevated above the base flood elevation plus freeboard by means of
piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the
water, and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity
of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an
area of special flood hazard, "elevated building" also includes a building
elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to
be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  The official map on which the
Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS)  The official report in which the
Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the
Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS  Zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion
control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term
describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which
provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
A. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.

additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without accumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than
0.2 foot.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in § 131-16A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
§ 131-16 WESTAMPTON CODE § 131-16
124:150
or victimization of the public as identified in § 131-16A(4), or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 131-8 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
(1) Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
§ 131-17A(2).

and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral
movement.
A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If Subsection A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with Article V, Provisions for flood hazard
reduction.
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
accumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 a foot at any
point.

B. Permits. Except when review is expressly exempted pursuant to
§ 140-6, all applications pertaining to historic landmarks or property in
historic districts shall be referred to the Commission by the Zoning
Officer for a written report on the application of the Zoning Ordinance28
provisions concerning historic preservation to any of those aspects of
the change proposed, which aspects were not determined by approval
of an application for development by the Land Development Board
pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law. The Commission, through its
Secretary, shall report to the Zoning Officer within 45 days of his
referral of the application to the Commission. If within the forty-five-day
period the Commission recommends against the issuance of the permit
or recommends conditions to the permit to be issued, the Zoning Officer
shall deny issuance of the permit or include the conditions in the
permit, as the case may be. Failure to report within the forty-five-day
period shall be deemed to constitute a report in favor of issuance of the
permit and without the recommendation of conditions to the permit.
C. Review when an application for development or building permit is not
required. In the event that the Zoning Officer shall determine that a
building permit and/or application for development involving any
development activity that would effect an historic district or historic
landmark is not needed, then the property owner and/or tenant of the
property on which the exterior changes, alterations or improvements
are proposed to be made shall make application directly to the
Commission for a certificate of appropriateness. The Commission shall
hear such applications employing its procedures set forth in § 140-7 and
the criteria set forth in the Commission bylaws and will render its
findings in writing. The findings of the Commission, in such cases, shall
be enforceable by the Zoning Officer.
A. When an historic landmark requires immediate emergency repair to
preserve the continued habitability of the building and/or health and
safety of its occupants or others, emergency repairs may be performed

§ 140-5 HISTORIC PRESERVATION § 140-6
140:171
§ 140-7. Application procedures for certificate of appropriateness.
in accordance with existing codes then in effect, without the necessity
of first obtaining the Commission's review. If the repairs utilize identical
materials and colors as were previously used, Commission review is
not necessary. If there is a change in material or color, the repairs
performed shall only be such that are necessary to maintain the
habitability of the improvement. A request for the Commission's review
shall be made as soon as possible and no additional work shall be
performed upon the improvement until an appropriate request for
approval is made and obtained in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this chapter.
B. For changes to the interior of improvements.
C. For ordinary repairs and maintenance which utilize identical materials
and colors as were previously used and which do not constitute a
change to the appearance of the improvement.
A. Application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made by the
applicant on forms available from the Secretary of the Historic
Preservation Commission and/or the Township Clerk. The application
must be completed and in the hands of the Secretary or the Township
Clerk at least 10 days prior to the next scheduled meeting of the
Historic Preservation Commission in order to be considered by the
Commission.
B. The Historic Preservation Commission shall reach a decision on the
application within (45) days after the Secretary has declared an
application to be complete; otherwise, the application shall be deemed
to have been approved. Nothing herein shall prohibit an extension of
time by mutual agreement of the applicant and the Commission. The
Commission may advise the applicant of its recommendations
regarding the consistency of the proposed action with the standards
applied by the Commission. If an application is approved, the
Commission shall forthwith issue a certificate of appropriateness. If the
Commission disapproves an application, the Commission shall state its
reasons, in writing, within 10 days of such decision.
C. In the event that an applicant alleges that the compliance with the
requirements of this section would be an unreasonable hardship and
that the nature of his application is such that the minor change sought
neither justifies the time and expense of the plenary proceeding nor will
impact negatively on the public good nor specifically on the historic
qualities sought to be preserved, the Commission, by a majority
affirmative vote of its full authorized membership, may grant such relief
from the requirement of this section as it deems consistent with the
public good and the purposes of this chapter.

cause nor prevent the filing of any collateral application or other
proceeding required by any other municipal ordinance to be made prior
to undertaking the action requested concerning the landmark or

C. Class III: a member of the governing body to be appointed by it.
D. Class IV: six other citizens of the municipality to be appointed by the

member of the Environmental Commission who is also a member of the
Land Development Board as required by N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1 shall be a
Class IV Land Development Board member.

respective terms of office, whichever occurs first. The term of the Class
IV member who is also a member of the Environmental Commission
shall be for three years or terminate at the completion of his term of
office as a member of the Environmental Commission, whichever comes
first.
B. The terms of all Class IV members first appointed pursuant to this
chapter shall be so determined that to the greatest practicable extent
the expiration of such term shall be evenly distributed over the first four
years after their appointment as determined by resolution of the
governing body; provided, however, that no term of any member shall
exceed four years, and further provided that nothing herein shall affect
the term of any present member of the Land Development Board, all of
whom shall continue in office until the completion of the term for which
they were appointed. Thereafter all Class IV members shall be
appointed for terms of four years except as otherwise herein provided.
All terms shall run from January 1 of the year in which the appointment

Disorderly conduct  See Ch. 117.
§ 171-1. Legislative intent.
The Township Committee does specifically find that far too many minors
are committing breaches of the public peace, which, in significant part, is
occasioned by a failure of the parent of the minor to exercise reasonable
control and supervision over the minor. Although the existing statutes do
afford a means to alert parents to their responsibilities to both the minor
and society in general, it is the considered opinion and legislative judgment
of the Township Committee that further legislation is necessary to
accomplish effective parental control and supervision. This chapter,
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, is intended to fill this void.
§ 171-2. Definitions and word usage.
A. Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the terms used herein are
defined as follows:
MINOR  An person under the age of 18 years.
PARENT  Includes either or both parents of a minor, the legal
guardians of such minor or any other person(s) having the care or
custody of the minor committing the violation of the public peace.
However, the term "parent" shall not apply to parents, legal guardians
or other persons whose custody and control over such minor has been
removed by court order, decree or judgment or military service or
marriage of such minor.
VIOLATION OF THE PUBLIC PEACE  Includes any of the following
acts: defacing, damaging or destroying public property or the private
property of another within the Township of Westampton; or committing
an assault or assault and battery upon another in the township; or
consuming and/or possessing alcoholic beverages in a public place in
the township; or breaking and entering or entering without breaking
into the property of another with the intent to steal; or threatening
another with the intention of extorting money or anything of value; or
possession and/or use of a controlled dangerous substance, as same
shall be defined under Title 24, Revised Statutes of New Jersey; or
juvenile delinquency based upon any of the above offenses.
B. Word usage. In order for a parent to violate § 171-3 of this chapter,

It shall be unlawful for any parent to assist, aid, abet, allow, permit, suffer
or encourage a minor to commit a violation of the public peace, as defined
herein, either by overt act, by failure to act or by lack of supervision and
control over such minor.
§ 171-4. Violations and penalties.
Any parent who shall violate the terms of this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, be subject to punishment by a fine not exceeding $500, in the
discretion of the court.

The remedy provisions of this chapter shall be cumulative, not exclusive,
and the state or any other person shall have the right to proceed under any
other legally available remedies.

§ 196-1. Purpose; site plan approval required; conformance with
other standards.
§ 196-2. Changes in use; requests for waiver of site plan review;
minor site plan.
A. The purpose of site plan review is to determine whether the proposed
building, structure or use will conform to the Revised Statutes of New
Jersey, the Zoning Chapter, the Land Subdivision Chapter and other
applicable requirements of the township. Site plan review shall work
towards the development of an aesthetically acceptable and wellordered
community serving the interest of the public health, safety and
general welfare of the township residents.
B. Prior to the excavation, grading or clearing of land for other than
agricultural purposes, or construction or issuance of any permit of the
Construction Official or Zoning Officer of the township, said
construction or permit pertaining to any building, structure or use
within the township, with the exception of a single-family dwelling in a
residential zone, site plan approval for the proposed grading, building,
structure or use must be obtained. No certificate of occupancy shall be
issued until and unless all construction and required improvements
shall have been completed in conformity with the approved site plan.
Notwithstanding the above, all development in the flood hazard area
shall require a site plan and be subject to the provisions of Chapter 131,
Floodplain Management, of the Township of Westampton, in addition to
the applicable sections of this chapter. Site plan review shall be
required prior to excavation, grading or clearing of land for other than
agricultural purposes in whole or in part in connection with the
installation of a second driveway on any premises. [Amended
8-18-1983 by Ord. No. 15-1983]
C. All construction and improvements shall be in accordance with the
design and construction standards for improvements set forth in the
Land Subdivision Chapter.57
57.Editor's Note: See Ch. 215, Subdivision of Land.
§ 192-7 WESTAMPTON CODE § 196-2
192:228
A. With the exception of residential dwelling units, any change of
permitted use will void the previously issued certificate of occupancy
and require the issuance of a new certificate of occupancy. The new use
will be subject to site plan review.
B. Any applicant may request a waiver from site plan review as required
under the terms of this chapter, provided that the applicant's site plan
involves the following and is not within the flood hazard area:
(1) An existing building.
(2) No new construction.
(3) No extension of the on-tract parking improvements are required.
(4) No change in the existing drainage.
(5) Construction of a building for agricultural purposes.
C. Request for waiver of site plan review shall be made by completion of
an appropriate form provided by the administrative official and
payment of the requisite fee. In the event that site plan waiver is not
granted, the applicant's fee will be applied to the site plan application.
The applicant will then be required to go forward with the requisite site
plan application. The balance of the fee and all escrows will be required
in the event site plan review is not waived.
D. Minor site plan submission; definition and required data. [Added
8-10-1987 by Ord. No. 13-1987]
(1) Definition. For site development which is not large in scale but
which does not qualify for site plan waiver, submission as a minor
site plan shall be permitted. A "minor site plan" shall be defined as:
(a) Building construction of less than 1,000 square feet; and/or
(b) Clearing, grading, paving or excavation of less than 1,500
square feet.
(2) Required data. The required data to support a minor site plan
application are as follows:
(a) A plan which may be drawn by the applicant.
(b) A plan showing all existing improvements on the site.
(c) The plan showing those improvements to be constructed.
(d) The plan showing a North arrow or North point.
(e) The plan containing a scale.
(f) The plan showing the zoning district in which the property is
located.

§ 196-3. Submission of preliminary site plan.
§ 196-4. Submission of final site plan.
A. No later than 15 working days prior to a regularly scheduled Land
Development Board meeting, the applicant shall submit six copies of
the preliminary site plan to the administrative official, who shall certify
the site plan as complete or incomplete within 45 days from the date of
filing. The administrative official shall transmit the site plans to the
Land Development Board for review except for those site plans
connected with a use variance which shall be submitted to the Zoning
Board of Adjustment. The appropriate board shall review the plan at a
public meeting, at which time the applicant may be called to explain,
amplify or discuss the plan. In the event of nonappearance of the
applicant, the plan may be denied for lack of prosecution. In the event
that the plan is denied by the reviewing authority, a statement of
reasons for the decision shall be given to the applicant. The applicant is
not required to amend the plan until after the reviewing authority has
acted at a public meeting, as all conditions and recommendations prior
thereto are purely advisory. [Amended 3-4-1986 by Ord. No. 7-1986;
11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
B. The reviewing authority shall take action on the site plan in such a
manner and within the time period as prescribed by the applicable
statutes of the State of New Jersey, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. and the
Land Use Procedures Chapter of the Township of Westampton.58
C. If preliminary site plan approval with conditions is granted, an
amended site plan conforming to the amendments or conditions
required by the approving resolution shall be submitted to the applicant
and certified by the Township Engineer prior to the applicant's
submittal of final plans.
D. Review or approval by the municipal reviewing authority does not
preclude the necessity for submission, review and approval by other
appropriate reviewing authorities. In appropriate instances, the
municipal authority may require approval by other reviewing
authorities prior to the municipal approval. In other instances, the
municipal reviewing authority may condition any approval that it grants
upon timely receipt of a favorable report by the other reviewing
authority.
A. No later than 15 working days prior to a regularly scheduled Land
Development Board meeting, the applicant shall submit six copies of
the final site plan to the administrative official, who shall certify the site
plan as complete or incomplete within 45 days from the date of filing.
The Township Engineer or other appropriate municipal employee or
official shall prepare a report which shall include a comparison of the
final site plan submission to the approved preliminary site plan. Said

§ 196-5. Concurrent submission of preliminary and final site plans.
The applicant may request at the time of preliminary filing that the plan
be processed through the preliminary and final stages concurrently. If
the reviewing authority concurs, the application may be processed in one
step with preliminary and final approvals being granted simultaneously.
However, the reviewing authority may, at its sole discretion, grant only
preliminary approval at the time of first review thereby requiring the
applicant to make a separate final site plan submission.
§ 196-6. Concurrent submission of site plan with request for
variance or conditional use.
report shall contain any recommendations and/or conditions to be
recommended to the reviewing authority. [Amended 3-4-1986 by
Ord. No. 7-1986; 11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
B. The reviewing authority shall either approve, approve with conditions
or deny. In the event of disapproval the applicant shall be given a
statement of reasons for the rejection of the plan.
C. After approval the applicant shall submit six copies of a revised plan
which conforms to any conditions imposed by the reviewing authority to
the administrative official of the municipality. No building permit shall
be issued or construction commenced until the final site plan has been
certified by the Township Engineer. No certification of the plan by the
Township Engineer nor signing of same by the chairman and secretary
of the reviewing authority shall be done until the required improvement
shall be completed or bonded for in conformity with those sections of
the Municipal Land Use Law and township requirements which deal
with the performance and maintenance guaranties. In the event that
said performance guaranty is not posted prior to final approval and final
approval is made contingent upon the posting of said performance
guaranty, the date of the vote of the resolution shall be the date of the
plan. If the performance guaranty is not posted within 190 days from
the date of approval, the approval shall expire and become null and void
and of no effect.
A. An applicant may submit to the Land Development Board for approval a
site plan accompanied by a request for a variance from the bulk and
area requirements of the Zoning Chapter, or a site plan accompanied by
a conditional use application. An applicant may submit to the Zoning
Board a use variance application accompanied by a site plan.
[Amended 11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
B. The municipal agency originally granting preliminary site plan approval
shall be responsible for reviewing and acting on the final site plan.

(2) General considerations. The site and surroundings should be
thoroughly analyzed. The following items shall be reviewed to
determine the design layout and/or plant material selection:
(a) The shape or form of the land itself.
(b) The geology and soil characteristics.
§ 196-8 SEWERS § 196-8
192:233
(c) The surface and subsurface water conditions.
(d) Existing vegetation patterns. (Except in urban and other highly
disturbed sites, the native vegetation found on and around the
site is usually a good indicator of which vegetation types will
perform well.)
(e) Movement of the site (earth) relative to the sun. Landforms and
other physical features will affect light and shadow patterns
and their motions.
(f) Local and regional climate (precipitation, temperature ranges,
humidity, wind patterns, etc.).
(g) Air and water pollution.
(h) Physical features both on and off site (existing or proposed
buildings, land forms, vegetation massings, etc.).
(i) Community, social and cultural values.
(3) General recommendations.
(a) Retaining the services of a New Jersey certified landscape
architect is recommended for the site analysis, design and
selection of plant material.
(b) A specific standard design module for street and highway
plantings will not be put forth here since each site (and its
surroundings) has a unique character. A downtown street tree
planting may only require a single species of shade tree equally
spaced in a geometric pattern. With the landscape forms most
often found in Westampton Township, the use of a single
species of trees in geometric patterns becomes less
appropriate. The linear, less formal hedgerow seen commonly
bounding cropland, fields and pastures is often a more suitable
model for plantings along lot lines and street and highways
traversing such landscapes.
(c) Rather than specify a modular design to be used on each
design proposal, the following plant material density for a
hypothetical fifty-foot-long by twenty-five-foot-wide module
which could be repeated as many times as necessary both in
length and width (e.g., a site with a highway frontage of 500
feet and a one-hundred-foot-wide buffer requirement would
need 40 modules). The plant material requirements of these
modules may be arranged to suit the specific landscape design
objectives of the proposed plan.
[1] The front yard buffer module shall include two canopy
trees (i.e., large deciduous trees) and three understory
trees (i.e., deciduous and/or evergreen trees that do not
generally reach the mature height of the canopy trees).
§ 196-8 WESTAMPTON CODE § 196-8
192:234
Species selection should be based on an appropriate
woodland successional model and shall include species
from the following list of canopy and understory trees:

(d) Plants native to the physiographic province in which the site
lies should comprise a minimum of 70% of the total number of
plants proposed for installation.
(e) The percentage of evergreen usage should be decided after
completion of site analysis and the statement of design goals.
(f) Canopy trees should be installed with minimum trunk
diameters of 1 1/2 to two inches (B&B).
(g) Understory trees should be installed with a minimum height of
five feet (B&B).
(h) Soil conditions should be renovated if necessary to improve
growing conditions.

192:236
§ 196-9. Required preliminary and final site plan details.
(i) Should it not be necessary to plant all the required modules
due to driveway and sight triangle locations, a credit should be
made (i.e., unused trees should be located elsewhere on the
site).
(j) All plans and installation of plant material are subject to review
and inspection by the municipal landscape architect, if there
be one, or the Township Engineer.
(4) Where parking is located in a front yard, the Land Development
Board may require construction of landscaped berms up to a height
of five feet, with slopes at a ratio of not less than two to one.
[Amended 11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
(5) Where off-street parking and loading areas adjoin or face premises
situated in a residential zone, the Land Development Board may
require the construction of a fence or wall not less than four feet
nor more than six feet in height, maintained in good condition.
[Amended 11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
C. Interior parking lot landscaping. All parking lots shall satisfy the
following design standards unless specifically exempted by this
subsection: [Added 8-9-2011 by Ord. No. 11-2011]
(1) A landscaped island of least 200 square feet shall be located at the
ends of all rows of parking.
(2) There shall be no more than 20 parking spaces in a row without an
intervening landscaped island of at least 200 square feet in size
separating additional parking spaces in the row. All nonresidential
buildings of 10,000 square feet or less in size shall be exempt from
this standard.
(3) Each landscaped island shall contain, at a minimum, at least one
deciduous shade or ornamental tree. In islands containing parking
lot light standards, signage, fire hydrants, electrical equipment or
similar equipment that prevents the placement of trees, lowgrowing
shrubs shall be substituted for the required trees.
(4) All trees within landscaped islands shall be limbed to seven feet
above-grade and all other plantings shall be limited to a mature
height of 30 inches.

§ 196-10. Fire lanes. [Added 4-19-1984 by Ord. No. 3-1984]
A. Fire lanes shall be designated as set forth hereafter on all plans and
specifications for the construction or remodeling of any public or quasipublic
structure where deemed necessary by the Township Fire
Marshal. The owner of any property on which there is presently located
a public or quasi-public structure which has no fire lanes or on which
the fire lanes presently existing are deemed inadequate by the Fire
Marshal shall be required, upon reasonable notice, to provide, locate
and designate appropriate fire lanes in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
B. Design. Each fire lane shall be constructed to a minimum width of 18
feet and shall be constructed of either asphalt paving, concrete,
concrete paving blocks or gravel. The fire lane shall be designed to
support a weight of approximately 40 tons. Where the fire lane is
required to access a roadway, a depressed curb must be provided.
Construction of the fire lane can be combined with a pedestrian path if
appropriately located and constructed. All fire lanes shall be visually
designated either by their form or by the materials used in their
construction. The design of the fire lanes shall be subject to review by
both the Township Fire Marshal and the Township Engineer.
[Amended 11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 19-1998]
C. Location. Fire lanes shall be located so as to serve the entire building
from the building site; so as to provide the most direct means of access
for all emergency vehicles; to be sufficiently close to the building to
provide the means to provide protection for the structure while being
far enough removed so as to provide safety for the emergency vehicle
using the fire lane in the event of collapse of the building. However, the
ultimate authority with respect to the determination for the location of
the fire lanes shall lie with the Fire Marshal of the Township of
Westampton. The Fire Marshal shall make the aforesaid determination
after reviewing recommendations of both the Township Engineer and
Township Planner.
D. Fire lanes shall be appropriately posted with signs indicating the words
"NO PARKING - FIRE ZONE" or "NO PARKING - FIRE LANE" in red
letters on a white background, with a red line bordering the perimeter
of the sign, said sign to be 12 inches by 18 inches, made of metal with
rust-resistant reflectorized coating, posted at the ends of each fire lane,
and at one-hundred-foot intervals therein. Fire areas shall also be
designated by covering the face and top of the curb of the prohibited
area with a solid yellow color of paint. The above criterion for the
painting of fire areas is to be considered a minimum, and additional
painting may be placed on the site consisting of crosshatches, solid
yellow areas or such other designations, in addition to the curb
painting, as may serve to act as a deterrent to parking in fire zones.

§ 196-10 WESTAMPTON CODE § 196-10
192:240
§ 196-11. Fees. [Amended 8-10-1987 by Ord. No. 13-1987]
The following fees shall be applicable:
E. The owner of the site upon which a fire lane is located shall be
responsible for constructing, designating and marking fire lanes as
required by this section. All maintenance and repair of the signs and
pavement markings, if any, shall remain the responsibility of the owner
and any successor. The maintenance and repair shall be a continuing
condition of any approval conferred with respect to the construction,
remodeling or occupancy of the building or structure on the premises.
Any failure to maintain or repair said signs or pavement markings shall
be a basis for voiding the prior approval. Approvals which shall be
conditional under this subsection shall include, but not be limited to,
final site plan approval and certificates of occupancy. No such approval
shall be held to be void unless a hearing by the issuing officer or agency
has been held on due notice to the owner of the premises.
F. Enforcement.
(1) No unauthorized vehicles shall be allowed to park, stand or stop in
any fire lane, nor shall any person in any manner obstruct any fire
lane. Any violation of this section shall be subject to a fine not to

Licenses and permits  See Ch. 152.
§ 203-1. Findings; purpose.
It is hereby determined, declared and recited that the legitimate business
or practice of soliciting and canvassing from door to door, regardless of
purpose, affords a means for the criminal-minded to obtain admittance to
private homes in furtherance of some present or future unlawful objective
and an opportunity for the practice of fraud, deceit and dishonest dealing by
the unscrupulous minority, with redress difficult because of lack of means
of identifying the solicitor, and, consequently, public safety and welfare
require that those going from door to door for any purpose be required first
to give such information as will identify themselves and prevent possible
abuse of the right by the criminally inclined.

orders or subscriptions for present or future delivery or furnishing of any
such things or matters; or for the purpose of making canvasses, surveys or
the like or doing any other act which is commonly comprehended in the
terms of soliciting, canvassing or peddling. "Solicit" does not include giving

A. Prior to the granting of final approval, the subdivider shall have
installed or shall have furnished performance guaranties for the
ultimate installation of the following:
(1) Streets. [Amended 2-28-1974 by Ord. No. 1-1974; 8-15-1977
by Ord. No. 6-1977]
(a) All streets shall be graded in accordance with approved
profiles and shall be paved with the following:
[1] Six-inch depth compacted Type 2, Class A or B subbase.
[2] Five-inch depth compacted bituminous stabilized base
course.
[3] Two-and-one-half-inch minimum compacted thickness
surface course of bituminous concrete FABC-2, laid in two
layers. The first course shall be one-and-one-half-inch
minimum thickness applied in one construction season.
The second course shall be one-inch minimum thickness
and applied in the second construction season. A period of
time of five months shall elapse between the first and
second courses unless a shorter period is approved by the
Township Engineer.
[4] The requirement of six-inch compacted thickness Type 2,
Class A or B subbase will not be required where the
seasonal highwater table is not within 2 1/2 feet of the top
of the proposed subgrade and where a CBR of 15 or
greater is obtained by proper testing of the existing
subgrade material. Additional depth subbase in excess of
the minimum six-inch depth required under Subsection
A(1)(a)[1] above shall be installed if, in the opinion of the
Engineer, six inches of subbase is not sufficient to provide
a stable subgrade.
[5] All low points in road profiles shall be properly
underdrained as approved by the Township Engineer.
(b) Test borings and observation wells, located at a minimum of
five-hundred-foot intervals in street areas, to determine the
types of soils and the water table shall be provided to the
Township Engineer prior to any street construction. To
ascertain the seasonal high-water table, these tests shall be
performed between December 1 and April 30. If the
performance of the tests during the above-mentioned time
period causes an undue delay upon the developer or applicant,
§ 215-14 SOIL REMOVAL § 215-14
199:345
existing available data and an inspection of the site shall be
the basis of determination by the Township Engineer of the

shall be supplied at any time prior to or during construction, if
requested by the Township Engineer, in areas of questionable
subgrade conditions.
(c) An underdrain system satisfactory to the Township Engineer
shall be designed and installed in all street areas where the
seasonal high-water table is within two feet six inches of the
top of the proposed subgrade or where, in the opinion of the
Engineer, subsurface conditions require underdraining to
properly protect any proposed street construction. Underdrain
systems shall consist of either combination drains, Type F
underdrains and subbase outlet drains, or a combination
thereof.
(d) All materials and methods of construction shall comply with
the New Jersey State Highway Department Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction 1961, and all
addenda and amendments thereto.
(e) All the above are minimum requirements and, based on test
borings, CBR tests, core borings, existing data, field
observation and information, the installation of underdrains,
subbase and/or alternate pavement designs may be required at
any time during construction.
(f) The costs of all soil test borings, CBR tests, core borings, field
investigation and observations and research and compilation of
existing data regarding the suitability of land for street
construction shall be the responsibility of the applicant and/or

used as spoil. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall
be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover to all
areas of the subdivision and shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting.
(8) Monuments. [Amended 8-12-1997 by Ord. No. 18-1997]
(a) Monuments shall be the size and shape required by N.J.S.A.

improvements which are necessary or appropriate for the
protection of the public interest by reason of the development's
effect on land other than the developer's property; street
improvements, water system, sewerage, drainage facilities and
easements therefor.
(b) Where such improvements are required, the approving
authority shall refer the requirements to the governing body
for concurrence and for approval of a performance guaranty to
be followed by a maintenance guaranty, if any shall be so
required.
(c) The governing body shall determine as to each required
improvement whether it is to be constructed or paid for by the
municipality as a general improvement or as a local
improvement or whether it is to be done by the developer with
a formula providing for partial reimbursement if the
improvement specifically benefits properties other than the
subdivision. In the absence of any specific finding or
determination made by the governing body with respect to
each off-tract improvement, each off-tract improvement shall

including the lands subject to development, will be
specially benefited therefrom.
(e) Bond, cash deposit or other surety.

condition for approval of this development application a
bond, cash deposit or such other surety as is satisfactory
to the municipality and the governing body thereof, to
insure payment to the municipality of the estimated
amount by which the subdivided property or property
subject to development will be specifically benefited by the
improvement of one of the following amounts:
[a] If the improvement is to be constructed by the
municipality as a general improvement, an amount
equal to the difference between the estimated cost of
the improvement and the estimated total amount by
which all properties to be serviced thereby, including
the subdivision property or property subject to
development, will be specially benefited by the
improvement.
[b] If the improvement is to be constructed by the
municipality as a local improvement, then, in addition
to the amount referred to in Subsection A(12)(e)[1][a]
above, the estimated amount by which the subdivision
property or property subject to development will be
specially benefited by the improvement.
[c] If the improvement is to be constructed by the
subdivider, site plan applicant or developer, an amount
equal to the estimated cost of the improvement.

loops with other lines which enclose areas of not more
than 1/4 of a square mile.
[3] Lines which provide the main feed from present or future
sources of supply or storage shall be 12 inches or larger
and shall be laid out so as to form loops with other lines
which enclose not more than one square mile.
[4] Lines whose only purpose is to serve abutting properties
and to which there is no fire hydrant connected and which
do not serve more than four residences may be four inches
if specifically approved by the township.
(b) In any event the township shall decide upon the size of lines to
be used and the above general criteria are set forth only as a
guide to the subdivider. A blowoff shall be provided beyond the
last connection. Air relief at high points shall be provided.
(c) In general, criteria affecting valve and hydrant locations shall
be that not more than one hydrant is affected by shutting off
any one section; hydrants are located within 600 feet along
street lines of any property in the subdivision; not more than
three valves are necessary to shut off any one section; and the
number of homes affected by shutting off any one section shall
be limited to approximately 25. The developer may be required
to furnish calculations of estimated operating pressure and fire
pressure for the proposed system, including dynamic and static
tests of the existing system.

(15) Drainage and drainage improvements. All drainage areas are to be
piped, where feasible, rather than ditched. Where piping is not
possible and swales and/or ditches must be used, the swales and
ditch lines shall be concrete-lined. The applicant shall submit his
proposed design, which must be approved by both the Board and
the Township Engineer. [Added 8-10-1987 by Ord. No. 12-1987]

maintain a civil action:
(1) For injunctive relief.
(2) To set aside and invalidate any conveyance made pursuant to such
a contract or sale if a certificate of compliance has not been issued
in accordance with Section 24 of Chapter 433 of the Laws of 1953,

(a) Meets regularly on a monthly or more frequent basis; and
(b) Whose governing body has adopted standards and procedures
in accordance with Section 20 of Chapter 433 of the Laws of

entitled to a lien upon the portion of the land from which the
subdivision was made that remains in the possession of the subdivider
or his assigns or successors, to secure the return of any deposit made or
purchase price paid, and also a reasonable search fee, survey expense
and title closing expense, if any. Any such action must be brought within

operation under the terms of this chapter shall give primary consideration
to the above-mentioned matters and to the welfare of the entire community.

because of peculiar conditions pertaining to his land, the literal
enforcement of one or more of these regulations is impracticable or will
exact undue hardship, the Land Development Board and governing body for
Land Development Board operation may permit such variance or variances
as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the
rules, regulations and standards established by this chapter.

name and address of the handicapped individual and the specific
location of the proposed restricted parking space.

the vehicle requiring the space and, if the applicant is the vehicle
operator, a valid motor vehicle operator license.
(3) The applicant may request a designated handicapped parking
space only for the applicant's place of residence.

has no objection to the restriction of parking in front of the
property.
D. The Township Clerk shall forward said application to the Bureau of
Traffic Safety for a recommendation on whether to approve or
disapprove said permit. Said recommendation shall be made within 21
calendar days of receiving such request.
E. Upon receipt of an application to designate a restricted parking space
for handicapped persons, the Bureau of Traffic Safety shall perform a
site inspection to determine the following:

(2) The location, width, grade and physical condition of off-street
parking and sidewalk connecting said parking to the residence.
(3) Whether parking is presently prohibited in front of said residence.

handicapped parking space could be designated without
interfering with the normal flow of traffic.
§ 232-23 TAXICABS § 232-23
221:405
F. An application for a handicapped space shall be denied if:
(1) Pursuant to applicable state or municipal law, the parking of motor
vehicles is prohibited at the location of the requested handicapped
parking space or the permitting of such parking would interfere
with the normal flow of traffic.
(2) The applicant or handicapped person is the owner of the property
at which the space is to be designated and has reasonable access to
a driveway on the property or reasonable access to some other area
of the property which may permit the transport of the handicapped
person.

complex which provides off-street parking and has reasonable
access to said parking and an on-site handicapped parking space
has been provided by the owner of the housing complex.
G. Upon receipt of a favorable recommendation for approval, the Township
Clerk shall forward the recommendation to the Township Committee for
adoption of an ordinance designating the handicapped space.
H. All permits issued under this article and prior to this article for the
establishment of a restricted handicapped parking space shall be
reviewed every year to determine the continued eligibility of the
parking space as follows:
(1) Annually, on or before July 1, written notice shall be sent by the
applicant to the Township Clerk, on forms provided by the
Township, indicating that a valid and continued need for the
handicapped parking space exists. In the event that such notice is
not received within 30 days, the handicapped parking space sign
shall be removed and the space will be repealed.
I. The addition of handicapped parking spaces in addition to the number
that are presently on the streets is a matter that the Township may
pursue on behalf of individuals who qualify fully under the article.
However, there is no obligation by the Township to create such spaces
in the event that creating the spaces would result in a shortage of
spaces for nonhandicapped drivers.

provide a means to coordinate long-range public and private
planning of projects for the medical campus use. Approval of
the GDP is intended to provide protections as set forth in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45.1 prior to preliminary and final site plan
and/or subdivision approvals. A GDP may have a term up to 20
years. Approval of the GDP is separate, and must be acted
upon separately, from preliminary and final site plan or
subdivision approvals, but nothing herein shall be deemed to
prohibit the simultaneous processing of separate applications
for subdivision and/or site plan approval, or both, for one or
more constituent components of the overall campus facilities.
(b) Eligibility.
[1] A GDP application shall be submitted prior to, or
simultaneously with, the filing of a preliminary subdivision
or site plan application, provided that all the requirements

the medical campus consist solely of hospital uses which are
exempt from real estate property taxation. Except for the acute
care hospital, hospice care residence and long-term-care facilities
(to a maximum of the first 800,000 square feet of area), there shall
be a one-to-one proportion between exempt and nonexempt uses
for all subsequent development within the medical campus, and the
developer shall use diligent efforts to attract nonexempt users to
the medical campus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the developer proposes to construct further development of
exempt uses within the medical campus and construction of a like
amount of nonexempt use has not commenced, then in that event
the developer and the Township shall negotiate a suitable
agreement in accordance with applicable law for payment in lieu of
taxes (PILOT) for the proposed exempt use until such time as the
one-to-one ratio provided herein has been restored.

§ 250-20 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-21
238:464
[1] No maximum or minimum percentages of any one
residential unit type are applied. A variety of unit types
and models as permitted in this section are encouraged in
accordance with the statements of objectives and intent. A
portion of the residential units may be age-restricted as
defined in the Zoning Ordinance.
[2] Residential development types permitted include, but are
not limited to, multifamily garden-style units, townhomes
and detached patio-style, Z-lot-style or zero lot line singlefamily
detached units.
[a] "Garden-style multifamily units" are defined as
architecturally designed units placed one on top of
another up to two units in height and having common
open spaces.
[b] Townhomes have no fewer than two nor more than 10
one-family adjacent units erected in a row as a single
building and have either condominium or fee-simple
ownership.
(b) Commercial and office uses and buildings, including the
private operation of a golf course. Commercial and office uses
must be incidental to the residential and recreational
character of the development.
(c) Permitted accessory buildings and structures for residential
areas, to include garages and carports, decks and attached
private greenhouses not operated for profit.
(d) Community oriented support facilities, such as guardhouses, a
community house, swim club, tennis club or other private or
public recreational facility.
(e) The golf course with accessory residential, commercial and
recreational facilities shall be administered under the laws of
the State of New Jersey as a planned unit development and
shall be referred to hereinafter in this chapter as a "planned
unit development." No planned unit development shall be
developed unless the residential, commercial and recreational
uses are ancillary and accessory to the golf course and related
golf course support facilities as set forth above.
B. Development objectives. The development objectives for the planned
unit development are as follows:
(1) In order that the public health, safety, morals and general welfare
be furthered to provide for housing and necessary office and
commercial facilities conveniently located to such housing.
§ 250-21 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-21
238:465
(2) To provide for well located, clean, safe, pleasant office and
commercial sites involving a minimum of strain on transportation
facilities.
(3) To ensure that the provisions of the Municipal Land Use Law,
Chapter 291 of the Laws of 1975, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., which
direct the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk, density and
open space within each zoning district are met.
(4) To encourage innovations in residential types and forms of
ownership and office and commercial development so that the
growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety
in type, design and layout of buildings and by the conservation and
more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings so that
greater opportunities for better housing and recreation, shops and
offices conveniently located to each other may extend to all citizens
and residents of the Township.
(5) In order to encourage a more efficient use of land and of public
services in lieu thereof and to reflect changes in the technology of
land development so that resulting economies may benefit those
who need housing
(6) To lessen the burden of traffic on streets and highways.
(7) To conserve the value of the land.
(8) In aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can relate
the type, design and layout of residential, commercial and office
development to the particular site and the particular demand for
housing and other facilities, including the foregoing, at the time of
development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the
property values within established residential areas and to ensure
that the increased flexibility of substantive regulations over land
development authorized herein is subject to such administrative
standards and procedures as shall encourage the disposition of
proposals for land development without undue delay.
C. Development intent. The Township of Westampton hereby adopts the
following Statement of Intent for Planned Unit Development: It is the
intent of this section to make possible, as a planned unit development, a
modification of lot density, lot area, lot width and use requirements in
R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, C and OR-1 Zones. These provisions are hereby
established in order to accomplish the following objectives: [Amended
4-28-1998 by Ord. No. 8-1998]
(1) To encourage the provision, conservation and more efficient use of
open space in new residential communities.
(2) To encourage the creation of new recreational facilities in
Westampton Township, including golf courses and swimming
facilities.
§ 250-21 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-21
238:466
(3) To encourage a pattern of development which promotes the best
interest of the Township regarding aesthetics, cultural resources,
ecological considerations and the preservation of natural
resources, including wetlands, floodplains, streams, tree masses
and natural topography.
(4) To allow for innovation in residential development to meet the
demands for a variety of housing types, sizes, designs and forms of
ownership.
(5) To provide a method for developing land for residential and
recreational use to allow the clustering of dwelling units to provide
a variety of housing types and to encourage flexible designs
enabling the preservation of open space in selected areas while
providing other associated benefits.
(6) To buffer new housing units from high-speed, high-volume
roadways and potentially conflicting nonresidential uses.
(7) To address the growing need for senior citizen housing.
(8) To provide for well located, clean, safe, pleasant office and
commercial uses incidental to the permitted residential uses,
involving a minimum strain on transportation facilities.
D. Standards of development.
(1) Minimum number of units, land size and location. No planned unit
development adopted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
shall be authorized that contains less than 150 contiguous acres, of
which the golf course shall be a minimum of 100 acres, and 300
residential units. R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, C and OR-1 Zoning Districts
within the Township may be used as a site for an overlay planned
unit development. In existing C and OR-1 Zones, golf courses are
permitted as part of the planned unit development overlay since
they may be operated as a commercial use. Residential uses as part
of the planned unit development are prohibited in existing C and
OR-1 Zones in order to maintain the consistency and integrity of
the adjacent commercial zone. Properties which adjoin an
approved planned unit development and which contain a minimum
of five acres may also be considered for application if the plan for
the parcel offers a logical continuation of the existing planned unit
development's streets, utilities, open space and overall lot layout.
[Amended 4-28-1998 by Ord. No. 8-1998]
(2) Residential density and associated standards. In consideration of
the amount, location and proposed use of common open space,
exclusive of the building area, for recreation and natural areas not
necessarily being contiguous; the location and existing physical
characteristics of the site of the proposed planned community; and
the location, design and type of dwelling units and other uses, the
densities may be varied on a net per-acre basis for construction of
§ 250-21 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-21
238:467
units. However, gross densities and related development and bulk
standards for residential use shall be the following:
(a) "Developable or buildable land" shall mean the gross acreage
of the tract, subtracting floodplains and wetlands and such
other developmentally restricted lands as are described below.
The remaining net acreage of the development shall then be
multiplied by 2.5 dwelling units per acre to achieve the
allowable number of units throughout any planned unit
development. Residential density calculations for a planned
unit development are inclusive of currently zoned residential,
commercial and commercial-industrial properties.
(b) The density of the site or tract shall be calculated based upon
the buildable acreage contained in the site or tract. Existing
lakes, streams, floodways, floodplains, flood hazard areas,
wetlands, environmentally sensitive land, slopes exceeding
15%, soils which do not have the necessary stability coefficient
to support the building or structure proposed, any land
encumbered by an easement where the right to build has been
precluded and areas of the tract which contain an historic
resource must all be excluded from the buildable acreage when
calculating density.
(c) No more than two townhomes may be attached in a straight
line. Consideration must be given to facade treatment with an
air toward variety and/or breaks in the line of the facade. The
maximum building length in any one plane for any multifamily
housing structure, excluding congregate care and nursing
home facilities, shall be 250 feet. "Plane" shall be defined as
the general building line, including facades or rooflines, with
breaks and/or projections. It is not intended to be interpreted
as only those perfectly straight lines.
(d) The lot on which each townhome is located shall be a minimum
of 20 feet in width at its narrowest point.
(e) No unit shall exceed three stories in height from ground level.
Where topography permits, three-story buildings shall be
constructed with the first story dwelling unit at ground level on
one side of the structure and the second tier of units fronting
on the other side of the structure at ground level. There shall
be no dwelling units below ground or below the first story
unless those units front on one side of the structure at ground
level with the second tier of units fronting on the other side at
ground level.
(f) The maximum number of garden-style units per structure shall
be 24, and the maximum number of townhomes per structure
shall be 10 units.
§ 250-21 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-21
238:468
(g) The maximum height of any building shall be 35 feet, as
measured from the high point of the ridge line to the average
elevation of the building at the grade line.
(h) Setbacks from perimeter property lines, from streets and one
building from the other.
[1] Setbacks. No multifamily building shall be closer than 25
feet to any perimeter property line of the tract or 35 feet
where a buffer is required. No paved or otherwise
improved impervious surface shall be closer than 10 feet
to any perimeter property line or 20 feet where a buffer is
required.
[2] The distances between multifamily buildings shall be as
follows:
Position Minimum Distances
(feet)
Front-to-front 60
Rear-to-rear 50
End-to-end or side-to-side 20
Where buffers are required 35
[3] No multifamily structure shall be located closer than 25
feet to the roadway right-of-way line or, if a private drive is
involved, 25 feet to the cartway from which access is
obtained.
[4] Setbacks; additions to existing multifamily structures.
Setbacks shall be measured in accordance with the
definition of setbacks, subject to the exception that any
dwelling unit being part of a multifamily structure shall be
held to have a minimum rear yard which runs from the
original rear building line to the rear lot line of the
property, and no structure may be erected therein, which
structure has either walls or is covered, without a
variance. This provision is intended to protect the
availability of light and air to adjacent structures and
properties and is not intended to prohibit or apply to the
construction of fences or patios.
(i) Building coverage and impervious surface coverage. Not less
than 20% of the gross area of the multifamily development
shall be devoted to green area. Twenty percent open space
may include detention basins and wetlands to the extent of 1/2
of said open space but shall not include retention basins, lakes,
streams, other areas of water, floodways, floodplains or flood
hazard areas. The eighty-percent impervious surface coverage
§ 250-21 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-21
238:469
can be apportioned in any manner among building coverage,
accessory building coverage, paving coverage, including
parking lot coverage, cartways and sidewalks, retention
basins, lakes, streams, etc.
(j) Outside lighting for security purposes shall be provided and
shall be so arranged as not to affect adversely the enjoyment of
any adjacent residential buildings or streets, sidewalks and
pedestrian walkways.
(k) No commercial, business or professional use shall be permitted
in any multifamily building unless approved by the Township
Land Development Board after review as being a use
compatible with the general residential nature of the building
and compatible with the appropriate use of adjoining lands.
[Amended 11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
(l) To encourage flexibility of housing density and type intended
by the planned unit development enabling legislation, in cases
of planned unit development proposed to be developed over a
period of years, deviations in the net density per acre may be
authorized from the density or intensity of use established for
the entire planned unit development. The Township Land
Development Board may allow for a greater concentration of
density or intensity of land use within some section or sections
of development, whether it be earlier or later in the
development, than upon others subject to the overall gross
density of the planned unit development. [Amended
11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
(m) Single-family residential buildings.
[1] For single-family residential buildings, no individual lot
shall contain less than 6,000 square feet nor have a lot
width of less than 40 feet. Building setbacks shall be as
follows:
[a] Front yard: 20 feet from the curbline of the street.
[b] Side yard: five feet each side or 10 feet on one side
when zero lot lines are used.
[c] Rear yard: 20 feet from the rear of each building to the
property line.
[2] Notwithstanding other regulations to the contrary,
setbacks for single-family homes shall be measured from
the nearest point of the building foundation. Eave
overhangs, chimneys, box windows and other building
protrusions extending from the vertical plane of a building
foundation shall not be considered in calculating building
setbacks. The developer shall be permitted to create lot
§ 250-21 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-21
238:470
easements to address building encroachments on
contiguous lots and for building maintenance where the
wall of a single-family home abuts or is in close proximity
to a property line.
(n) Required utilities. All units, residential, commercial or
recreational, located within the planned unit development shall
be served by public sewer and water facilities. The only
permitted exceptions shall be isolated residential properties on
existing roadways with lot sizes of greater than one acre.
(o) The planned unit development shall address fire protection and
make adequate provisions to minimize the risk and exposure to
fire in light of the type of housing and proposed layout of the
development.
(3) Commercial and office density and associated standards.
Commercial and office development serving the needs of nearby
residential areas shall have a building coverage such as described
by the Zoning Ordinance of the Township of Westampton.
(4) Common open space, buffer, recreation and access easement
requirements.
(a) A minimum of 20% of the planned unit development shall be
open space. Open space requirements may include credit of up
to 50% for the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas
such as wetlands and floodplains of equal or greater area. An
additional credit of 50% may be given for commercial golf
course open space when special benefit is offered to
homeowners within the planned unit development in the form
of reduced annual membership fees.
(b) Ownership arrangements of common open space areas shall be
as determined by the Land Development Board at the time of
approval. Ownership arrangements may include public
dedication or private ownership such as a homeowners'
association or proprietorship. [Amended 11-10-1998 by
Ord. No. 24-1998]
(c) Buffer areas are required between residential and
nonresidential development and also between multifamily
development, including townhome development, garden-style
multifamily units and single-family dwellings, whether part of
the same project or on an adjacent tract. A buffer area will also
be required between multifamily development of the nature set
forth above from one another or single-family dwelling areas,
developed or proposed, whether on the multifamily housing
tract or adjacent thereto. For uses within the same project, the
Land Development Board shall waive this buffer requirement if
appropriate transitional uses or open space are employed or if
§ 250-21 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-21
238:471
topography eliminates the need for said buffer. Buffers are
required where the perimeter property line abuts a public
roadway and the setbacks set forth in this chapter are adhered
to. Where a buffer is required along a side or rear property
line, a strip of land at least 20 feet wide in the yard or setback
area shall be designated as a buffer area. Buffer areas shall
adjoin residential property lines and be of uniform width. The
buffer area shall contain a landscape screen consisting of a
six-foot-high visual barrier of plantings of suitable materials
set in a double row, staggered and spaced to accomplish this
purpose, or a landscaped earthen berm parallel to the lot
line and set back an appropriate distance, said berm to be
improved with a suitable landscape buffer treatment. Plant
materials, spacing and location of the plant materials as set
forth elsewhere in the developmental ordinances of
Westampton Township shall be controlling. [Amended
11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
(d) With respect to any multifamily dwelling structure, which

ARTICLE VII
General Provisions
§ 250-22. Performance standards.
The following provisions and performance standards shall apply to all zones:
A. Accessory buildings and portable storage units. [Amended 6-13-2000
by Ord. No. 12-2000; 4-22-2003 by Ord. No. 13-2003; 11-10-2009
by Ord. No. 14-2009]
(1) Accessory buildings. Any accessory building attached to a principal
building is part of the principal building and shall adhere to the
yard requirements for the principal building. No building permit
shall be issued for an accessory building prior to the issuance of a
building permit for the principal building. Construction of the
principal building shall precede or coincide with the construction of
the accessory building, otherwise the building permit for the
accessory building may be revoked. The accessory building shall be
compatible in appearance with the area in which it is located. No
accessory building in any zone or district shall exceed 600 square
feet unless the lot exceeds three acres in size. No accessory
building shall be located closer to the front property line than the
rear building line of the principal building. No accessory building
shall be located any nearer to any rear or side yard property line
than that number of feet specified on the Schedule of Yard, Area
and Bulk Requirements,97 except that sheds 120 square feet or less
can have a three-foot side and rear setback.
(2) Portable storage units.
(a) Permit required; application fee; exception for new residential
construction. Before placing a portable storage unit on his, her
or its property, a person or other owner of residential property

shall be units utilized for new residential construction;
however, any unit shall be removed from the new residential
dwelling lot within 30 days of the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy.
(b) Duration. Permits will be granted for a period of 30 days. Prior
to the expiration of the thirty-day period, applicants may seek
to extend their permits for an additional 30 days by seeking an
extension with the Zoning Officer. Extension of a permit will
cost $25 for each 30 days granted. In no event shall a permit

this chapter.
§ 250-22 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-22
238:481
with extensions be granted for more than 90 days except upon
application to the Westampton Land Development Board for
approval upon good cause shown.
(c) Public property. No temporary storage unit shall be placed or
maintained by any private party on any Township property,
street or right-of-way, except that such a unit may be placed in
a street right-of-way subject to the following conditions:
[1] Approved by the Westampton Police Department.
[2] Limited to a maximum of seven days; no extensions are
permitted.
[3] Unit shall be marked with reflective striping.
[4] Applicant must demonstrate there are no viable locations
on-site.
(d) Private property. Portable storage units are prohibited from
being placed on or in the front yard of a property and shall only
be permitted in the driveway of the property at the furthest
accessible point from the street. All locations must be paved
off-street surfaces.

§ 250-22 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-22
238:482
B. Buffers.
(1) Where multifamily housing projects, commercial or industrial uses
or conditional uses abut any residential district or zone or existing
residential use, the multifamily housing project, commercial,
industrial or conditional use must buffer along the abutting
property line along such other property lines as are necessary in
order to effectively screen and buffer its use from the residential
districts and/or uses.
(2) Where specified above or as it is determined necessary as a result
of site plan review and/or the applicant's landscape plan, a buffer
strip shall be provided along property lines adjacent to a zone of
lesser degree of use so as to provide protection to adjacent
properties, except where such lot lines abut or are along street
frontages and the relaxation of the buffer requirements is
necessary to provide for the safe access to and from a public street.
Buffer strips shall be free from structures, accessory buildings,
signs, driveways, parking areas, outdoor storage areas, recreation
facilities or other active uses.
(3) Buffer areas shall require site plan approval and are required along
all lot lines and street lines which separate a townhouse, apartment
or nonresidential use from either an existing residential use or a
residential zoning district. Buffer areas shall be developed in an
aesthetic manner for the primary purposes of screening views or
reducing noise perception beyond the lot. Buffer widths shall be
measured horizontally and perpendicular to lot and street lines. No
structure, activity, storage of materials or parking of vehicles shall
be permitted in a buffer area. The location and design of buffer
areas are intended to provide flexibility in providing effective
buffers. The location and design of buffers shall consider the use of
the portion of the property being screened, the distance between
the use and the adjoining property line, difference in elevations, the
type of buffer, such as dense planting, existing woods, a wall or
fence, buffer height, buffer width and other combinations of manmade
and natural features. The buffer shall be designed, planted,
graded, landscaped and developed with the general guideline that
the closer a use or activity is to a property line or the more intense
the use, the more effective the buffer area must be in obscuring
light and vision and reducing noise beyond the lot. Parking areas,
trash collection and utility areas and loading and unloading areas
shall be screened around their perimeters by either a landscape
screen, fence or grass buffer area, whichever is appropriate for the
use involved.
(4) All buffer areas shall be planted and maintained with either grass
or ground cover maintained at a maximum height of eight inches,
together with a screen or scattered planting of trees, shrubs or
other plant material meeting the following requirements:
§ 250-22 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-22
238:483
(a) The preservation of all natural wooded tracts shall be an
integral part of all site plans and may be calculated as part of
the required buffer area, provided that the growth is of a
density and the area is of a width to serve the purpose of a
buffer. Sizes and varieties of plants in newly established
plantings shall be grouped so as to screen 75% of the headlight
glare within three years and be a minimum of eight feet in
height within three years. Ground cover of mulch, grass or
other plant material shall be used to reduce collecting debris
and present a pleasant appearance. Ground elevations shall
require adjustments of plant height and shall relate to adjacent
parking areas; loss in elevation in planting areas in relation to
parking areas will necessitate proportionate increases to plant
sizes. Where additional plantings are necessary to establish an
appropriate tone for an effective buffer, the plantings may be
required. [Amended 4-28-1998 by Ord. No. 8-1998]
(b) The buffer planting shall be so placed that, at maturity, it will
not be closer than 10 feet to any cartway. [Amended
4-28-1998 by Ord. No. 8-1998]
(c) Shade trees shall be of nursery stock, free of insects and
disease, as shown by valid nursery inspection certificates, a
minimum of 10 feet to 12 feet in height and 1 1/2 inches to two
inches in caliper, with grading quality and balling standards in
accordance with the USA Standard for Nursery Stock, as
sponsored by the American Association of Nurserymen, Inc.
(1967).
(d) Any plant material which does not live shall be replaced within
one year or one growing season.
(e) Screen plantings and landscaping shall be broken at points of
vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress to assure a clear
sight triangle at all street and driveway intersections.
(5) Species and varieties of plantings recommended for planting
Township streets and buffer areas shall be those approved by the
Township Engineer and/or the Township Planning Consultant,
using the following guidelines for development of the landscape
plan:
(a) Screening shall be provided with buffer strips so as to provide
a visual or partial accoustical barrier to conceal the view or
sounds of various utilitarian operations and uses from the
street or adjacent properties. Screening may consist of the
following:
[1] Landscape berms planted with attractive vegetative
covering.
§ 250-22 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-22
238:484
[2] A solid masonry wall not less than five feet, six inches
above ground level.
[3] A solid fencing, uniformly painted or of a naturally durable
material such as cedar, cypress or redwood, not less than
six feet above ground level and open to the ground to a
height of not more than four inches above ground level.
[4] Dense hedges of shrubbery or evergreens planted at 30
inches on center in a single row or at five feet on center in
two staggered rows. Evergreens or shrubs shall be a
minimum of five feet above ground level at the time of
planting and permitted to grow to a minimum of six feet
above ground level.
(b) Living buffers and screens shall be maintained by the owner of
the property where the use requires a buffer or a screen. Any
failure to maintain the buffer or screen in the future
constitutes a violation of this chapter subjecting the owner of
the property to penalties imposed herein and revocation of a
certificate of occupancy which will require a new submission of
site plan to the Land Development Board with particular
emphasis on the buffer and screen area and a resolution of the
problems involved by replacing the living buffer with screening
of solid fencing and masonry, as set forth above. [Amended
11-10-1998 by Ord. No. 24-1998]
(c) Size of buffer strips. Buffers in nonresidential districts shall be
as provided in the standards for the individual nonresidential
zoning district. In other cases where buffers are required,
pursuant to § 250-22B(1), the buffer shall be 50 feet in width.
[Amended 4-28-1998 by Ord. No. 8-1998]
C. Corner lots. Any principal or accessory building located on a corner lot
shall have a minimum setback from both street right-of-way lines equal
to the required front yard and shall not interfere with a required sight
triangle. The remaining yards shall both be considered as side yards
with respect to setback. Corner lots shall meet the requirements of the
zone where located both as to frontage and setback. In no case shall the
frontage be less than 200 feet on any street. Measurement shall be
made from the ends of the connecting curve.
D. Energy conservation. All development shall be carried out in a manner
which promotes energy conservation and maximizes active and passive
solar energy in accordance with any applicable statutes. Such measures

easily accessible for police review and inspection so as to maintain
safety, peace and order in the community.
(8) Where two or more developments are proposed for construction or
are in the process of construction, which developments are either
adjacent to one another or are in close proximity to one another,
the number of dwelling units in the two developments shall be
added together to determine the type of recreation facilities
needed for the area, and the responsibility for providing and
constructing the recreation facilities so determined shall be
allocated proportionately between or among the developments.

Housing (COAH) Third Round Substantive Rules, N.J.A.C 5:94-1.4, as
amended, are hereby incorporated by reference.
B. Phasing of units. Inclusionary developers shall complete construction
on and obtain certificates of occupancy for units intended for low- and
moderate-income occupancy in tandem with the market-rate
(unrestricted) units according to the following schedule:

10% and no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units;
(b) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units are twobedroom
units; and
(c) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units are threebedroom

(2) Age-restricted, low- and moderate-income units shall provide, at a
minimum, that the number of bedrooms shall equal the number of
age-restricted, low- and moderate-income units within the
inclusionary development. The standard can be met by creating all
one-bedroom units or by creating a two-bedroom unit for each
efficiency unit.
§ 250-27 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-27
238:529
E. Controls on affordability. In placing households in low- and moderateincome
units, the Housing Officer shall utilize the following verification
and certification procedures:
(1) Every household member 18 years of age or over who will live in
the affordable unit and receives income shall be required to provide
income documentation as applicable and determined by the
Housing Officer. This includes income received by adults on behalf
of minor children for their benefit. Household members 18 years of
age or over not receiving income must produce documentation of
current status.
(2) Verification may include, but is not limited to, the following:
(a) Four (4) consecutive pay stubs, including overtime, bonuses or
tips, dated within 120 days of the interview date, or a letter
from an employer stating current annual income figures as
projected annually;
(b) A copy of regular IRS Form 1040 (Tax Computation Form),
1040A or 1040EZ, as applicable, and state income tax returns
filed for each of the three years prior to the date of the
interview;
(c) A letter or appropriate reporting form verifying benefits, such
as social security, unemployment, welfare, disability or pension
income (monthly or annually);
(d) A letter or appropriate reporting form verifying any other
sources of income claimed by the applicant, such as alimony
and child support;
(e) Reports that verify income from assets to be submitted by
banks or other financial institutions managing trust funds,
money market accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks or
bonds;
(f) Evidence or reports of income from assets, such as real estate
or businesses that are directly held by any household member;
(g) Evidence or reports that verify assets that do not earn regular
income, such as non-income-producing real estate or savings
that do not earn interest; and
(h) A notarized statement of explanation in such form as to be
satisfactory to the reviewer.
(3) Generally, sources of annual income shall be based on regular
income reported to the IRS and which can be utilized for mortgage
approval. Household annual gross income shall be calculated by
projecting current gross income over a twelve-month period.
§ 250-27 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-27
238:530
(4) Income includes, but is not limited to, wages, salaries, tips,
commissions, alimony, regularly scheduled overtime, pensions,
social security, unemployment compensation, AFDC, verified
regular child support, disability, net income from business or real
estate and income from assets such as savings, CDs, money market,
mutual funds, stocks and bonds, and imputed income from nonincome-
producing assets, such as equity in real estate.
(5) Assets not earning a verifiable income shall have an imputed
interest income using a current average annual savings interest
rate. Assets not earning income include current real estate equity.
Applicants owning real estate must produce documentation of a
market value appraisal and outstanding mortgage debt. The
difference will be treated as the monetary value of the asset and the
imputed interest added to income.
(6) Income from assets that have delayed earnings, such as IRAs or
annuity programs, shall not be included in current income until
such payments are being received. However, these assets must be
reported and verified.
(7) Net rent from real estate is considered income after the monthly
mortgage payment, including real estate taxes and insurance, is
deducted. Other expenses are not deductible. In addition, the
equity in the rented real estate is considered an asset and will have
the imputed interest income on the calculated value of equity
added to income.
(8) Income does not include payments, rebates or credits received
under federal or state low-income home energy assistance
programs, food stamps, payments received for care of foster
children, relocation and assistance benefits, income of live-in
attendants, scholarships, student loans, personal property such as
inheritances, one-time lottery winnings and insurance settlements
except for additional income earned from these additions and
casual, sporadic or irregular gifts and bonuses.
(9) Standard credit information services that provide conventional
credit and tenant reports may be utilized when certifying a
household with required written permission from the household.
An unsatisfactory credit history or credit information that
demonstrates a disproportionate debt to income ratio may result in
a denial of certification. Court-ordered payments for alimony or
child support to another household shall be considered a regular
monthly debt whether or not it is being paid regularly.
(10) Households whose total gross annual income is measured at 50%
or below 50% of the authorized median-income guidelines shall be
certified as low-income households and referred to units
designated for low-income households.
§ 250-27 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-27
238:531
(11) Households whose total gross annual income is measured above
50% but below 80% of the authorized median income shall be
certified as moderate-income households and referred to units
designated for moderate-income households.
(12) Generally, households will be referred to units where
predetermined total monthly housing costs correspond to the
household's calculated ability to pay, using 28% of gross monthly
income as a standard for home ownership and 30% of gross
monthly income as a standard for rental units.
(13) At the discretion of the administrative entity, households may also
be required to produce documentation of household composition
for determining the correct unit size and the applicable medianincome
guide.
(14) Generally, households will be referred to available units using the
following standards for occupancy:
(a) A maximum of two persons per bedroom;
(b) Children of the same sex in the same bedroom;
(c) Unrelated adults or persons of the opposite sex other than
husband and wife in separate bedrooms; and
(d) Children not in the same bedroom with parents.
(15) Households may be considered for units other than as above, but in
no case shall a household be referred to a unit that provides for
more than one additional bedroom per household occupancy
standards as stated in Subsection E(14)(a) above.
(16) A form for certification shall be prepared and signed by the
Housing Officer. Only households receiving certification shall be
referred to affordable housing units.
(17) Certified households who reject an opportunity for affordable
housing may be replaced on the referral list at their request and
may be reinterviewed for certification when their name appears on
a listing for a subsequent unit.
(18) Certification shall be valid for no more than 120 days unless a valid
sales contract or lease has been executed within that time period.
In this event, certifications shall be valid until such time as the
sales contract or lease is ruled invalid and no occupancy has
occurred. Certifications may be renewed in writing at the request
of a certified household for no more than an additional period of
120 days at the discretion of the administrative entity.
(19) Households who are denied certification may make a written
request for a redetermination. Households shall be required to
produce additional documentation to support their claim.
§ 250-27 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-27
238:532
Households who are denied certification a second time may request
a hearing by forwarding a written request to the Housing Officer
within 30 days following the household's receipt of a denial
notification. If a written request has not been received within the
thirty-day time period, the ineligible determination will be final.
The hearing decision shall be final.
F. Length of controls.
(1) Newly constructed low- and moderate-income sales units remain
affordable to low- and moderate-income households for an
appropriate period of not less than 30 years. The Housing Officer
shall require all conveyances of newly constructed low- and
moderate-income sales units subject to the Act to contain the deed
restriction and mortgage lien adopted by COAH.
(2) Rehabilitated, owner-occupied or renter-occupied housing units
that are improved to code standard shall be subject to affordability
controls for at least six years.
(3) Newly constructed and/or gut-rehabilitated low- and moderateincome
rental units remain affordable to low- and moderate-income
households for a period of 30 years. Affordability controls on rental
units may exceed the prescribed periods if the developer agrees to
a longer period.
(4) Housing units created through conversion of a nonresidential
structure shall be considered a new housing unit and shall be
subject to controls on affordability as delineated in Subsections
F(1) and F(3) above.
G. General provisions concerning uniform deed restriction liens and
enforcement through certificates of occupancy or reccupancy on sales
units.
(1) A certificate of occupancy for initial occupancy of a low- or
moderate-income sales unit shall not be issued unless there is a
written determination by the Housing Officer that the unit is to be
controlled by a deed restriction and mortgage lien as adopted by
COAH. The Housing Officer shall make such determination within
10 days of receipt of a proposed deed restriction and mortgage lien.
Amendments to the deed restriction and lien shall be permitted
only if they have been approved by COAH. A request for an
amendment to the deed restriction and lien may be made by the
Housing Officer, the Township or a developer.
(2) The initial occupancy of a low- or moderate-income sales unit shall
not be permitted prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy in
accordance with Subsection G(1) above.
(3) A certificate of reoccupancy shall be required for any occupancy of
a low- or moderate-income sales unit resulting from a resale, and
§ 250-27 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-27
238:533
such certificate shall not be issued unless there is a written
determination by the Housing Officer that the unit is to be
controlled by the deed restriction and mortgage lien prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy regardless of whether the
sellers had executed the deed restriction and mortgage lien
adopted by COAH upon acquisition of the property. The Housing
Officer shall make such determination within 10 days of receipt of
a proposed deed restriction and mortgage lien.
(4) The certificate of reoccupancy shall not be required in sales for
which controls are allowed to expire or in which the repayment
option is being exercised.
(5) The mortgage lien and the deed restriction shall be filed with the
Records Office of the County of Burlington. The lien and deed
restriction shall be in the form adopted by COAH unless
amendments have been approved by COAH.
(6) The deed restriction, including the repayment clause, and the
mortgage lien shall have priority over all mortgages on the
property except for a first mortgage placed on the property by the
mortgagee prior to the expiration of resale controls.
H. Option to buy sales unit.
(1) The deed restriction governing the deeds of low- and moderateincome
units shall include an option permitting purchase of the
affordable housing unit at the maximum allowable restricted sales
price at the time of the first nonexempt sale after controls on
affordability have been in effect on the unit for the period specified
in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2. The option to buy shall be available to the
Township, the DCA, the Agency or a qualified nonprofit.
(2) All deed restrictions governing low- and moderate-income units
shall require the owner to notify the Housing Officer and COAH by
certified mail of any intent to sell the unit 90 days prior to entering
into an agreement for the first nonexempt sale after controls have
been in effect on the housing unit for the period specified in N.J.A.C.
5:93-9.2.
(3) Upon receipt of such notice, the option to buy the unit at the
maximum allowable restricted sales price or any mutually
agreeable sales price that does not exceed the maximum allowable
restricted sales price shall be available for 90 days. The Housing
Officer shall notify the Township, the DCA, the Agency and COAH
that the unit is for sale. If the Township exercises this option, it may
enter into a contract of sale. If the Township fails to exercise this
option within 90 days, the first of the other entities giving notice to
the seller of its intent to purchase during the ninety-day period
shall be entitled to purchase the unit. If the option to purchase the
unit at the maximum allowable restricted sales price is not
exercised by a written offer to purchase the housing unit within 90
§ 250-27 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-27
238:534
days of receipt of the intent to sell, the owner may proceed to sell
the housing unit pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.8. If the owner does
not sell the unit within one year of the date of the delivery of notice
of intent to sell, the option to buy the unit shall be restored and the
owner shall be required to submit a new notice of intent to sell 90
days prior to any future proposed date of sale.

restricted sales price shall be exercised by certified mail and shall
be deemed exercised upon mailing.

(1) If the Township elects to purchase a low- or moderate-income unit
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93:9.4, it may:
(a) Convey or rent the housing unit to a low- or moderate-income
purchaser or tenant at a price or rent not to exceed the
maximum allowable restricted sales price or rent, provided
that the unit is controlled by a deed restriction or an
alternative approved by COAH; or
(b) Convey the unit at fair market value subject to the provisions of
Subsection I(3)(c) below.
(2) If the Township purchases low-income housing units, it shall
maintain them as low-income housing units.
(3) If the Township elects to purchase low- or moderate-income
housing units and conveys them at a fair market value, it shall:
(a) Notify COAH of any proposed sale and sales price 90 days
before closing;
(b) Notify COAH of the price differential as defined in N.J.A.C.
5:93-1.3; and
(c) Deposit the price differential in an interest-bearing housing
trust fund devoted solely to the creation, rehabilitation or
maintenance of low- and moderate-income housing.
J. State option; sales units.
(1) When the DCA or the Agency elects to purchase a low- or moderateincome
unit pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4, it may:
(a) Convey or rent the housing unit to a low- or moderate-income
purchaser or tenant at a price or rent not to exceed the
allowable restricted sales price or rental; or
(b) Convey the unit at fair market value and utilize the price
differential to subsidize the construction, rehabilitation or
maintenance of low- and moderate-income housing within the
appropriate housing region.
§ 250-27 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-27
238:535
K. Nonprofit option; sales units.
(1) Nonprofit agencies may apply to COAH at any time for the right to
purchase low- or moderate-income units subsequent to the period
of controls on affordability, provided that the unit remains
controlled by a deed restriction approved by COAH.
(2) Nonprofit agencies that have been designated by COAH shall be
eligible to purchase low- or moderate-income units pursuant to
N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4 for the sole purpose of conveying or renting the
housing unit to a low- or moderate-income purchaser or tenant at a
price or rent not to exceed the allowable restricted sales price or
rental. Low-income units shall be made available to low-income
purchasers or tenants, and the housing unit shall be regulated by
the deed restriction and lien adopted by COAH. The term of the
controls on affordability shall be the same as those required by
N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2.
L. Seller option; sales units.
(1) An eligible seller of a low- or moderate-income unit which has been
controlled for the period established in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2 who has
provided notice of an intent to sell may proceed with the sale if no
eligible entity as outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.19(c) and 5:80-26.22
exercises its option to purchase within 90 days.
(2) Subject to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.9, the seller may elect to:
(a) Sell to a qualified low- and moderate-income household at a
price not to exceed the maximum permitted sales price in
accordance with existing COAH rules, provided that the unit is
regulated by the deed restriction and lien adopted by COAH for
a period of at least 30 years; or
(b) Exercise the repayment option and sell to any purchaser at
market price, provided that 95% of the price differential is paid
to the Housing Officer as an instrument of the Township at
closing.
(3) If the sale will be to a qualified low- or moderate-income household,
the Housing Officer shall certify the income qualifications of the
purchase and shall ensure that the housing unit is regulated by the
deed restriction and lien required by COAH.
(4) The Housing Officer shall examine any contract of sale containing a
repayment option to determine if the proposed sales price bears a
reasonable relationship to the housing unit's fair market value. In
making this determination, the Housing Officer may rely on
comparable sales data or an appraisal. The Housing Officer shall
not approve any contract of sale where there is a determination
that the sales price does not bear a reasonable relationship to fair
market value. The Housing Officer shall make a determination
§ 250-27 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-27
238:536
within 20 days of receipt of the contract of sale and shall calculate
the repayment option payment.
(5) The Housing Officer shall adopt an appeal procedure by which a
seller may submit written documentation requesting the
administrative entity to recompute the repayment obligation if the
seller believes an error has been made or to reconsider a
determination that a sales price does not bear a reasonable
relationship to fair market value. A repayment obligation
determination made as a result of an owner's appeal shall be a final
administrative determination of the Housing Officer.
M. Township rejection of repayment option; sales units.
(1) The Township has the right to determine that the most desirable
means of promoting an adequate supply of low- and moderateincome
housing is to prohibit the exercise of the repayment option
and maintain controls on lower-income housing units sold within
the Township beyond the period required by N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2. Such
determination shall be made by resolution of the Township
Committee and shall be effective upon filing with COAH and the
Authority. The resolution shall specify the time period for which the
repayment option shall not be applicable. During such period, no
seller in the Township may utilize the repayment option permitted
by N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.8.
(2) If the Township exercises the option outlined in Subsection M(1)
above, it shall:
(a) Provide public notice in a newspaper of general circulation;
and
(b) Notify the administrative entity and COAH of the Township
Committee's action.
(3) The Housing Officer shall ensure that the deed restriction on all
affected housing units reflects the extended period of controls.
N. Continued application of options to create, rehabilitate or maintain lowand
moderate-income units; sales units. When a housing unit has been
maintained as a low- or moderate-income unit after controls have been
in effect for the period specified in the deed, the deed restriction
governing the housing units shall allow the Township, the state,
nonprofit agencies and sellers of low- and moderate-income units to
again exercise all of the same options as provided in this chapter.
O. Eligible capital improvements prior to the expiration of controls; sales
units.
(1) Property owners of single-family, owner-occupied housing may
apply to the Housing Officer for permission to increase the
maximum price for eligible capital improvements. "Eligible capital
§ 250-27 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-27
238:537
improvements" shall be those that render the unit suitable for
a larger household. In no event shall the maximum price of an
improved housing unit exceed the limits of affordability for the
larger household. Property owners shall apply to the Housing
Officer if an increase in the maximum sales prices is sought.
(2) At resale, all items of property which are permanently affixed to the
units and/or were included when the unit was initially restricted
(for example, refrigerator, range, washer, dryer, dishwasher, wallto-
wall carpeting, etc.) shall be included in the maximum allowable
resale price. Other items of property may be sold to the purchaser
at a reasonable price that has been approved by the Housing
Officer at the time of signing the agreement to purchase. The
purchase of central air conditioning installed subsequent to the
initial sale of the unit and not included in the base price may be
made a condition of the unit resale, provided that the price has
been approved by the Housing Officer. Unless otherwise permitted
by COAH, the purchase of any property other than central air
conditioning shall not be made a condition of the unit resale. The
owner and the purchaser must personally certify at the time of
closing that no unapproved transfer of funds for the purpose of
selling and receiving property has taken place at resale.
P. Subsidy to ensure affordability prior to the expiration of controls; sales
units. If the use of median-income data adopted by COAH to index the
cost of housing renders a unit unaffordable to a low- or moderateincome
household at the time of resale, the Township shall not lose
credit for the housing unit, provided that adequate controls on
affordability remain in place, but the Township may subsidize the
housing unit to maintain affordability.
Q. Impact of foreclosure on resale while controls are in place; sales units.
A judgment of foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure to a financial
institution regulated by State and/or Federal law or to a lender on the
secondary mortgage market (including, but not limited to, the Federal
National Mortgage Association, the Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,
the Government National Mortgage Association or any entity acting on
their behalf) shall not extinguish controls on affordable housing units.
[Amended 8-8-2006 by Ord. No. 12-2006]
R. Excess proceeds upon foreclosure; sales units. In the event of a
foreclosure sale, the owner of the affordable housing unit shall be
personally obligated to pay the Housing Officer any surplus funds, but
only to the extent that such surplus funds exceed the difference
between the sales price at the time of foreclosure and the amount
necessary to redeem the debt to the financial institution, including
costs of foreclosure.
S. Annual indexed increases while controls are in place; sales and rentals.
§ 250-27 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-27
238:538
(1) The price of an owner-occupied housing unit may increase annually
based on the percentage increase in the regional median income
limit for each housing region. In no event shall the maximum resale
price established by the Housing Officer be lower than the last
recorded purchase price.
(2) With the exception of rentals constructed pursuant to low-income
tax credit regulations, the rent of a low- or moderate-income
housing unit may be increased annually based on the percentage
increase in the housing consumer price index for the United States.
This increase shall not exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for units
constructed pursuant to low-income tax credit regulations shall be
indexed pursuant to the regulations governing low-income tax
credits.
T. Procedures for initial sales, resale prior to the expiration of controls
and rentals.
(1) Low- and moderate-income sales units shall not be offered to nonincome-
eligible households at initial sale without COAH approval.
Parties that petition COAH for such approval shall document efforts
to sell housing units to income-eligible households.
(2) Persons wishing to sell affordable units shall notify the Housing
Officer of the intent to sell. If no eligible buyer enters a contract of
sale for the unit within 90 days of notification, the Housing Officer
shall have the option to purchase the unit for a negotiated price
that shall not exceed the maximum price permitted based on the
regional increase in median income as defined by HUD or other
recognized standard adopted by COAH. If the Housing Officer does
not purchase the unit, the seller may apply for permission to offer
the unit to a non-income-eligible household at the maximum price
permitted. The seller shall document efforts to sell the unit to an
income-eligible household as part of this application. In reviewing
the request, the Housing Officer shall consider the specific reasons
for any delay in selling the housing unit and the hardship to the
seller in continuing to offer the affordable unit to an income-eligible
applicant. The inability to sell a unit for the maximum permitted
resale price shall not, in itself, be considered an appropriate reason
for allowing a housing unit to be sold to a non-income-eligible
household. If the request is granted, the seller may offer a lowincome
housing unit to a moderate-income household and a
moderate-income housing unit to a household earning in excess of
80% of median. In no case shall the seller be permitted to receive
more than the maximum price permitted. In no case shall a sale
pursuant to this section eliminate the resale controls on the unit or
permit any subsequent seller to convey the unit except in full
compliance with the terms of this chapter. The over-income
purchaser may pay the same condominium or homeowner
association fees as the market purchaser if the master deed so
provides. If an income-eligible purchaser subsequently purchases a
§ 250-27 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-27
238:539
unit previously owned by an over-income purchaser, the
condominium or homeowner association fee shall revert to the fee
currently charged to all income-eligible owners.
(3) Owners of low- and moderate-income rental units shall not offer
rental units to non-income-eligible households without prior
approval of COAH. Parties that petition for such approval shall
document all efforts to rent to income-eligible households and
demonstrate to the satisfaction of COAH that alternatives, such as
a reduction in rent, are not feasible.
U. Affirmative marketing.
(1) Legislative authority:
(a) This article will apply to all developments that contain
proposed low- and moderate-income units.

housing program in general.
(b) After receiving a completed application, the developer shall
make a preliminary determination for eligibility based on
annual income, the number of family members and age. Age
shall be an eligibility standard for age-restricted units only. If
eligibility is tentatively established, the applicant's income
shall be verified. In addition, the developer will have
performed a credit record search. If information received
shows a record of bad credit or exposes erroneous information
on the application, the applicant shall be given an opportunity
to explain. If the developer believes the explanation refutes the
derogatory information, then the application shall be

the form of a written notice to the applicant. The determination
of the Township Committee shall be deemed to be final.
V. Procedures for recertification of tenants.
(1) Responsibilities of the developer:
(a) The developer of low- and/or moderate-income rental units
shall certify annually, in the month of January, that their rental
prices comply with the low- and moderate-income affordable
rental charges currently established under the terms of this
article and shall submit a certified rent roll showing apartment
numbers, name(s) of all tenants and rent charges.
(b) Existing renters' income eligibility will be recertified annually.
The developer will be responsible for gathering updated
information, as was required upon initial occupancy, and
submitting that documentation and re-certification form to the
Housing Officer for recertification. These forms and
documentation shall be filed with the Housing Officer at least
60 days before the anniversary of the lease inception.
(2) Responsibilities of the Housing Officer:
(a) The Housing Officer shall notify all developers of low- and
moderate-income rental units of any adjustments in income
ceilings and/or affordable rental charges.
(b) The Housing Officer shall send to the developer a current copy
of this article and any rules and regulations developed
pursuant to it, application forms and list of required
documentation to be submitted by any renter.
(c) The Housing Officer shall, within 30 days of receipt of a
complete application from the developer, review the
documentation and determine if the renter remains qualified.
The Housing Officer shall notify the renter and the developer of
the determination in writing.
(3) Responsibilities of renter applying for recertification:
§ 250-27 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-27
238:544
(a) The renter shall complete and sign the application for
recertification as a qualified renter of low- and/or moderateincome
affordable housing and submit the same to the
developer.
(b) The rental shall submit with the above application all pertinent
documentation required by the Housing Officer.
(4) Procedure in the event a renter is no longer qualified: If it is
determined that an existing renter's income exceeds the relevant
income ceiling, the following will apply:
(a) If the renter's income exceeds 100% of the moderate-income
ceiling, the renter may continue in occupancy and shall pay a
rent that is greater than the applicable final affordable rental
charge, such that the total cost for rent and utilities equals
30% of the renter's gross aggregate family income. That
portion of the rent that is greater than the applicable final
affordable rental charge (excess rental income) shall be paid to
the Township. The funds paid to the Township shall be utilized
to assist the Township in maintaining its housing program for
low- and moderate-income persons. [Amended 8-8-2006 by
Ord. No. 12-2006]
(b) (Reserved)113
(c) If the gross aggregate family income of a previously qualified
moderate-income renter falls below the low-income ceiling, as
soon as a low-income family vacates, that renter may be
requalified as a low-income renter and only be responsible for
paying the affordable rental charge for a low-income unit. The
developer then may fill the vacant rental unit with a new
qualified moderate-income renter who will pay the affordable
rental charge for a moderate-income unit.
(5) Procedure if apartment is vacant due to failure to requalify: If any
apartment is vacated as a result of failing to requalify a renter, the
same procedure will be followed by the developer, the Housing
Officer and the applicant as on initial occupancy of the rental unit.
W. Qualifying units. Dwelling units which are not built pursuant to one of
the above affirmative programs, but whose sale or rental price qualifies
them for low- and moderate-income occupancy, and which can be
counted in the fair-share allocation, shall not be subject to the above
restrictions pertaining to affordability or to the administrative
procedures dealing with sale and resale, letting and reletting.
X. Inability to sell or rent.

238:545
(1) In the event that low- and moderate-income units cannot be sold or
rented, as applicable, within six months of being substantially
completed and offered for sale or rent, any inclusionary developer
may apply to the Township Committee for relief. Such application
must provide evidence of the developer's having undertaken an
affirmative marketing effort to sell or rent the units. Relief to the
developers shall not include exempting the units from the low- and
moderate-income sales prices or rent level, nor shall relief include
exempting the units from restrictions on appreciation allowable
upon resale or restrictions on escalation allowable upon rerental.
(2) The Township Committee may allow a special-exemption qualified
buyer/renter to purchase or rent any inclusionary unit based upon a
statement of exemptions and surcharge if the Township Committee
finds it appropriate. The Township Committee is not limited to this
Section or those methods of relief.

purposes of this article or to prevent continuing violation of the
article.
(3) Any person violating any provision of this article shall be
responsible for all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees
incurred by the Township in the enforcement process.
(4) The Township shall encourage the resolution of disputes and other
issues regarding alleged violations of this article by mediation and
conciliation. To that end, the Housing Office, through the Housing
Officer, shall provide the person suspected of any violation with
prior notice and an opportunity to respond in writing to the issues

provisions of this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a
fine not to exceed $1,000 or by imprisonment in the county jail for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or by both such fine and

§ 250-28. Mandatory set-asides for low- and moderate-income
housing construction.
Z. Waivers. Any person adversely affected by the strict adherence to this
article may apply to the Township Committee or its designee for a
waiver of interpretation of that section which adversely impacts his/her
situation. Such application shall be in writing and contain a full
statement of the facts and circumstances. The Township Committee or
its designees shall consider such a request and shall advise such person
as to whether relief is to be granted. In considering such requests, the
Township Committee or its designee shall give primary consideration to
the purpose underlying this article and the specific regulation involved
and shall weigh this purpose against the specific reasons sought to
justify a departure or modification.
AA. Forms. The Housing Officer shall create and from time to time
supplement and/or modify application forms so that the information
needed to make a fair evaluation of income eligibility may be obtained.
At a minimum, this form shall include current information regarding the
applicant's family size, income, expenses, assets and liabilities.
A. Where required. Whenever construction of multifamily housing or onefamily
detached dwellings on lots of less than 20,000 square feet is
proposed in the R-3 and R-4 Districts, the developer shall be required to
provide a set-aside and to construct low- and moderate-income housing
as required pursuant to this article. Mandatory set-aside construction
shall be provided according to the requirements of §§ 250-27 through
250-28.
B. Exemptions: maximum density; minimum set-aside; credits.

Districts with the exception of minor subdivisions involving lots to
be constructed according to the standards contained in
§ 250-12A(1) and (2).
(2) Multifamily housing: A maximum density of six residential dwelling
units of multifamily housing per net acre shall be permitted,
provided that the developer constructs a mandatory set-aside of
20% of the units for low- and moderate-income housing. When
multifamily development is proposed at a lower density than six
units per net acre, the following set-aside requirements shall apply:
Development Density
(units/acre)
Required Percentage of Lowand
Moderate-Income Units

up to four units per net acre shall apply. A mandatory set-aside of
15% of the single-family units for low- and moderate-income
housing is required.
(4) Mixed-housing types: Where the development is composed of
multifamily housing and single-family housing, calculation of the
required set-aside shall be based on the number of multifamily
units and single-family units. The set-aside requirement may be
satisfied by construction of the low- and moderate-income units in
either the multifamily housing or the single-family housing or
partially in each. The fifteen-percent set-aside shall only apply to
the extent that the low- and moderate-income units are located in
the single-family detached structures. If the obligation is proposed
to be satisfied by locating the low- and moderate-income housing in
the multifamily structures, the twenty-percent set-aside shall apply
based on the total number of dwelling units to be built throughout
the development.
(5) Rental housing: The Township shall be eligible for all rental
housing bonus credits as determined by the current rules of the
New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (COAH).

areas of water, floodways, floodplains or flood hazard areas. The
eighty-percent impervious surface coverage can be apportioned in
any manner among building coverage; accessory building
coverage; paving coverage, including parking lot coverage;
cartways and sidewalks; retention basins; lakes; streams, etc.
(9) The density of the site or tract shall be calculated on the net
acreage of the site or tract.
(10) All proposed residential development shall be located on the
buildable acreage of the tract. The buildable acreage of the tract
shall be calculated excluding existing lakes, streams, floodways,
floodplains, flood hazard areas, wetlands and wetlands transition
§ 250-28 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-28
238:551
areas, environmentally sensitive land, slopes exceeding 15%, soils
which do not have the necessary stability coefficient to support
the building and structure proposed, any land encumbered by an
easement where the right to build has been precluded and areas
of the tract which contain a historic resource. All areas or pockets
proposed for buildable acreage shall be contiguous, with a
maximum pocket area of at least three acres in a geometric
configuration that makes all of the building acreage in the pocket
usable. The pocket must be accessible to streets and roadways
without traversing wetlands or wetland transition areas. In
addition, the buildings to be located on the buildable acreage shall
meet all setback criteria and other restrictions and criteria of this
chapter such as buffers, which may affect the ultimate dwelling
unit number count.
E. Buffers. Buffer areas are required between residential and
nonresidential development and also between multifamily development,
including townhouse development, garden apartments, congregatecare
facilities and areas zoned, developed or proposed for single-family
dwellings, whether part of the same project or on an adjacent tract. A
buffer area will also be required between multifamily development of
the nature set forth above from one another or single-family dwelling
areas, zoned, developed or proposed, whether on the multifamily
housing tract or adjacent thereto. For uses within the same project, the
Land Development Board shall waive this buffer requirement if
appropriate transitional uses are employed or if topography eliminates
the need for said buffer. Buffers are required where the perimeter
property line abuts a public roadway. All requirements of § 250-22B
shall be met.
F. Pedestrian access. With respect to any multifamily dwelling structure
which structure has interior units, as opposed to end units, the
developer shall provide pedestrian access easements along the front,
side and rear lot lines or building lines nearest to and surrounding the
structure so as to provide unobstructed access to the occupant of the
interior unit to his/her rear yard. It shall be unlawful for said pedestrian
accessway or easement to be obstructed in any manner such as by
fences, landscaping, etc.
G. Recreational facilities. Recreational facilities are required for all
townhouse and garden apartment developments. Congregate-care
facilities are exempt from the active recreation facility requirement but
shall appropriately improve the twenty-percent open space as a passive
recreation facility, said improvements consisting of benches, paths,
landscaping and other amenities. Recreational facilities shall comply
with the ordinance requirements for subdivisions as set forth in the
Township development standards.
H. Architectural and design requirements.
§ 250-28 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-28
238:552
(1) Any addition, exterior alteration, modification or change to an
existing building shall be compatible with the design, character
and color of the original building. Any new detached structure shall
also be compatible with the design, character and color of the
parent structure.
(2) All exterior painting and roofing, woodwork, trim work and siding
shall be kept the same color as that established and/or agreed to by
the owners of the entire building for the entire building. (Singlefamily
attached units, where rooflines and siding are not the same
elevation or continuous from one unit to the next, are excluded
from this section.) [Amended 3-12-2013 by Ord. No. 3-2013;
6-11-2013 by Ord. No. 6-2013]
(3) Storm and screen windows and doors shall conform to the
architectural character and color scheme of the home.
(4) Retaining walls, other structures, mounds, changes of grade and
drainage are prohibited.
(5) Extensions, widening or rerouting of existing driveways is
prohibited. Walkways are permitted, provided that they do not
exceed 30 inches in width and are constructed of concrete, laid
brick or patio stone in sand. Larger patios are permitted if the
drainage is not affected and they are constructed to conform to the
architectural character and scheme of the home.
(6) No outdoor animal enclosures, runs, houses or pens shall be
permitted unless the property is enclosed with a fence a minimum
of four feet high.
(7) Exterior antennas of any type are prohibited. (Twin homes and
duplex homes are excluded.)
(8) Except where a fence or wall has specifically been approved by the
Board of Directors, or a committee established by the Board of
Directors, of a homeowners association operating within and for a
residential community in the Township of Westampton, in which
case the decision of the homeowners association shall control, all
fences and walls constructed within the Township shall be subject
to the following: [Amended 7-10-2007 by Ord. No. 12-2007]
(a) Fences are to be no higher than six feet and are to be of a wood
board-on-board type with a natural finish. (Clear
weatherproofing or varnish is permitted.)
(b) Property owners shall obtain a permit to erect the fence, said
permit to be obtained from the Construction Official.
(9) Every effort shall be made so that both the facade and the type of
unit of the low- and moderate-income units shall in no way be
distinguishable from the facades or types of the other units in the
§ 250-28 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-28
238:553
§ 250-29. Mandatory development fees. [Amended 3-24-2009 by
Ord. No. 3-2009]
development. Comparable design shall be employed so that the
low- and moderate-income units look as much as possible like the
market units.
(10) Residential dwelling units shall be dispersed throughout an
inclusionary development as much as is reasonably possible. Where
there exists more than one type of unit, such as townhouses and
apartments, low- and moderate-income units may be allocated
disproportionately to one or more of the types of dwelling units if
the same is necessary in order to meet the sales or rental price
criteria set forth in this chapter. This provision shall not be
construed to allow geographic concentration of the low- and
moderate-income units in one area of the development. As part of
the developer's preliminary plat submission, a plan of dispersal of
the low- and moderate-income units among a suitable number of
market units shall be submitted and approved.
(11) Modular, prefabricated, manufactured, panelized or units by
similar names may be used for the implementation of low- and
moderate-income units.
I. Site development standards.
(1) Developments proposed under this chapter shall comply with the
Residential Site Improvement Standards (N.J.S.A. 5:21), as
amended.
(2) All other Township regulations as set forth in the Code of the
Township of Westampton which relate to the development of
property shall apply to any project which contains low- and
moderate-income housing, except as otherwise specifically varied
and changed herein.
A. Purpose.
(1) Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, the power to adopt public ordinances
for public health, safety and welfare of the Township of
Westampton is conterminous with the power of the legislature; and
in Holmdel Builder's Association V. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985
(the Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution,
subject to the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption
of rules.
(2) Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, § 8 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2), and the
Statewide Nonresidential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-8.1 through 40:55D-8.7), COAH is authorized to adopt and
promulgate regulations necessary for the establishment,
§ 250-28 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-29
238:554
implementation, review, monitoring and enforcement of municipal
affordable housing trust funds and corresponding spending plans.
Municipalities that are under the jurisdiction of the Council or
court of competent jurisdiction and have a COAH-approved
spending plan may retain fees collected from nonresidential
development.
(3) This section establishes standards for the collection, maintenance,
and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's
regulations and in accordance P.L. 2008, c. 46, §§ 8 and 32 through
38. Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be used for the sole
purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This
section shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules
on development fees, codified at N.J.A.C. 5:97-8, as such rules and
to the extent such rules are deemed applicable to the Township by a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(4) Notwithstanding the adoption of the provisions contained herein,
the within Code provisions shall not be construed as a waiver by
Westampton Township of any right it possesses to pursue claims set
forth in a certain Superior Court, Law Division complaint that
challenges the validity of New Jersey P.L. 2008, c. 46, which
contains the changes to the New Jersey Fair Housing Act that this
section is intended to implement.
B. Basic requirements.
(1) This section shall not be effective until approved by COAH pursuant
to N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.1.
(2) Westampton Township shall not spend development fees until
COAH has approved a plan for spending such fees in conformance
with N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.10 and 5:96-5.3.

§ 250-29 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-29
238:555

through 54:1-35c).
GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES  Those strategies that minimize the
impact of development on the environment, and enhance the health,

D. Residential development fees.
(1) Imposed fees.
(a) Within all residential zoning district(s) of the Township of
Westampton, residential developers, except for developers of
the types of development specifically exempted below, shall
pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for
residential development, provided no increased density is
permitted.
(b) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers shall pay a development fee of 6% percent of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during
the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance
application, the base density for the purposes of calculating
the bonus development fee shall be the highest density
permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the
filing of the variance application.
(c) Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on
a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1 1/2%
of the equalized assessed value on the first two units; and the
specified higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized assessed
value for the two additional units, provided zoning on the site
has not changed during the two-year period preceding the
filing of such a variance application.
(2) Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
residential development.
(a) Affordable housing developments, developments where the
developer is providing for the construction of affordable units
elsewhere in the municipality, and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
§ 250-29 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-29
238:556
(b) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a
site plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building
permit shall be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan
approval for this purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested
on the date that the building permit is issued.
(c) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an
existing structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is
demolished and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is
not otherwise exempt from the development fee requirement.
The development fee shall be calculated on the increase in the
equalized assessed value of the improved structure.
E. Nonresidential development fees.
(1) Imposed fees.
(a) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except
for developers of the types of development specifically
exempted, shall pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized
assessed value of the land and improvements, for all new
nonresidential construction on an unimproved lot or lots.
(b) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types
of development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee
equal to 2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value
resulting from any additions to existing structures to be used
for nonresidential purposes.
(c) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an
existing structure is demolished and replaced. The
development fee of 2.5% shall be calculated on the difference
between the equalized assessed value of the preexisting land
and improvement and the equalized assessed value of the
newly improved structure, i.e., land and improvement, at the
time final certificate of occupancy is issued. If the calculation
required under this section results in a negative number, the
nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
(2) Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(a) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or
market-rate development shall be subject to the two-and-ahalf-
percent development fee, unless otherwise exempted
below.
(b) The two-and-a-half-percent fee shall not apply to an increase in
equalized assessed value resulting from alterations, change in
§ 250-29 VEHICLES, UNREGISTERED § 250-29
238:557
use within existing footprint, reconstruction, renovations and
repairs.
(c) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the
payment of nonresidential development fees in accordance
with the exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as
specified in the Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey
Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption Form."
Any exemption claimed by a developer shall be substantiated
by that developer.
(d) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from
the nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.
46, shall be subject to it at such time the basis for the
exemption no longer applies, and shall make the payment of
the nonresidential development fee, in that event, within three
years after that event or after the issuance of the final
certificate of occupancy of the nonresidential development,
whichever is later.
(e) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit
the fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid
nonresidential development fees under these circumstances
are enforceable by Westampton Township as a lien against the
real property of the owner.
F. Collection procedures.
(1) Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable
approval for a development, the applicable approving authority
shall direct its staff to notify the construction official responsible
for the issuance of a building permit.
(2) For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be
provided with a copy of Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Non-
Residential Development Certification/Exemption" to be completed
as per the instructions provided. The developer of a nonresidential
development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions
provided. The construction official shall verify the information
submitted by the nonresidential developer as per the instructions
provided in the Form N-RDF. The Tax Assessor shall verify
exemptions and prepare estimated and final assessments as per the
instructions provided in Form N-RDF.

permit shall notify the local tax assessor of the issuance of the first
building permit for a development which is subject to a
development fee.
§ 250-29 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-29
238:558
(4) Within 90 days of receipt of that notice, the Municipal Tax Assessor,
based on the plans filed, shall provide an estimate of the equalized
assessed value of the development.
(5) The construction official responsible for the issuance of a final
certificate of occupancy notifies the local assessor of any and all
requests for the scheduling of a final inspection on property which
is subject to a development fee.
(6) Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final
inspection, the Municipal Assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements
of the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter
notify the developer of the amount of the fee.
(7) Should Westampton Township fail to determine or notify the
developer of the amount of the development fee within 10 business
days of the request for final inspection, the developer may estimate
the amount due and pay that estimated amount consistent with the
dispute process set forth in Subsection b of § 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).
(8) Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time
of issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion shall be
collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The
developer shall be responsible for paying the difference between
the fee calculated at building permit and that determined at
issuance of certificate of occupancy.
(9) Appeal of development fees.
(a) A developer may challenge residential development fees
imposed by filing a challenge with the Burlington County Board
of Taxation. Pending a review and determination by the Board,
collected fees shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow
account by Westampton Township. Appeals from a
determination of the Board may be made to the tax court in
accordance with the provisions of the State Tax Uniform

§ 250-30. Growth share requirement. [Added 12-12-2006 by Ord.
No. 16-2006]
Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, and/or an affirmative
marketing program. In the case of a rehabilitation program, no

Township shall not expend development fees after the expiration of its
substantive certification or judgment of compliance.
A. Applicability.
(1) This subsection of the land use regulations of Westampton

associated with development taking place within Westampton
Township.
§ 250-29 WESTAMPTON CODE § 250-30
238:562
(2) Residential development. Except as exempted in the subsection
"Exemption" below, all residential development that results in the
construction of new market-rate dwelling units in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 5:94-1 et seq., shall be subject to the "growth share"
provisions of this section.
(3) Nonresidential development. All nonresidential development that
results in an increase in gross floor area of an existing
nonresidential structure; the construction of a new nonresidential
structure; or the conversion of one nonresidential use to a different
nonresidential use that increases jobs, based on job conversion
factors, by use, contained as Appendix E in N.J.A.C. 5:04-1 et seq.,
shall comply with § 250-29, the Development Fee Ordinance.
B. Exemptions. Residential developments that received preliminary or
final approval from the Land Development Board prior to the effective
date of this section.
C. Residential growth share provisions
(1) All residential development which results in construction of new
market-rate dwelling units in Westampton Township shall provide
one affordable unit on site for every eight market-rate units
constructed.
(2) For developments that result in a number of market-rate residential
units not evenly divisible by eight, the developer may construct the
additional affordable unit on site or, alternatively, the developer
may make a payment in lieu of constructing the additional
affordable unit. If the developer selects the latter option, the
amount of said payment shall be one percent (1%) of equalized
assessed value as determined by the Township Tax Assessor for the
market-rate units, 1/2% payable at building permit issuance and 1/
2% payable at the time of issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
(3) All residential development consisting of fewer than eight
residential units may provide one affordable unit on site or may
make a payment in lieu of constructing the proportionate fraction
of the affordable-housing unit requirement. If the developer selects
the latter option, the amount of said payment shall be the same as
Subsection C(2) above.

agricultural development area, meaning an area identified by a County
Agriculture Development Board pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A.

or site plan approval, direct any developer to include in the deed to
buyers advisement of this Right to Farm Ordinance.

amendment thereto, except as modified herein, are binding upon the
company as terms and conditions of this consent. The Application and
other relevant writings submitted by the company shall be annexed hereto
and made a part hereof by reference, provided same do not conflict with
applicable state or federal law.
§ A261-44. Competitive equity.
Should the Township of Westampton grant a franchise to construct, operate
and maintain a cable television system to any other person, corporation
or entity on terms materially less burdensome or more favorable than the
terms contained herein, the company may substitute such language that
is more favorable or less burdensome for the comparable provision of this
ordinance subject to the provisions of N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7.
§ A261-45. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
ordinance is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court
or federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and its validity or
unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
the ordinance.
§ A261-45.1. Incorporation of changes by state or federal agencies.
Should any state or federal agency or body modify, change or alter any of its
provisions with respect to cable television, the company shall comply with
federal and state law.

qualified existing and future public library at no charge, provided the
facility is located within 175 feet of active cable distribution plant. The
Internet service shall be installed on a personal computer that is
accessible to library patrons and not for administrative use only.
E. Within 12 months of passage of the certificate of approval, the company
shall make available to Township residents served by Comcast of
Burlington County, LLC, the educational and government access
channel broadcast to Westampton Township residents served by
Comcast of Garden State, LLC, pursuant to the conditions outlined in
§ A261-60 of this ordinance. The company will make every effort to
deliver said educational and governmental access programming to all
residents served by Comcast of Burlington County, LLC; however, it
shall not be required to do so in areas where the company deems it to
be cost prohibitive.
A. The company will continue to provide one channel for educational and
governmental ("EG") access for the shared use by the municipalities of
Westampton Township, Lumberton Township, Mount Holly Township,
Eastampton Township and Hainesport Township (collectively,
"municipalities").
B. The company will provide and maintain the cable, modulators and
equipment necessary for the Township education-government access
channel to send a signal to the company, and to receive the return feed
signal. The company will not be responsible for the acquisition or
maintenance of any studio facility or equipment used for the access
channel, including, but not limited to, cameras, editing decks, monitors,
character generators, etc.
C. The company does not relinquish its ownership of or ultimate right of
control over a channel by designating it for EG use. An EG access user,
whether an educational or government user, acquires no property or
other interest by virtue of the use of a channel so designated, and may
not rely on the continued use of a particular channel number, no matter
how long the same channel may have been designated for such use.
D. The company shall not exercise editorial control over any educational
or governmental use of channel capacity, except the company may
refuse to transmit any educational or governmental access program or
portion of an educational or governmental access program that
contains obscenity, indecency, or nudity.

The company shall at all times maintain a comprehensive general liability
insurance policy with a single limit amount of $1,000,000 covering liability
for any death, personal injury, property damages or other liability arising
out of its construction and operation of the cable television system, and an
excess liability (or "umbrella") policy in the amount of $5,000,000.
E. The governing body of the municipalities shall be responsible for
developing, implementing, and enforcing rules for EG access
programming.
F. Educational access. "Educational access" shall mean noncommercial
use for educational purposes that is managed, scheduled, and
programmed by local educational institutions such as public or private
schools, but not "home schools," community colleges, and/or
universities.
G. Government access. "Government access" shall mean noncommercial
use by the governing bodies, for the purpose of showing the public local
government at work.
H. Company use of fallow time. Because blank or underutilized EG
channels are not in the public interest, in the event the municipality or
other EG access users elect not to fully program their EG access
channel, the company may program unused time on those channels (at
its discretion and for any purpose), subject to reclamation by the
municipality upon no less than 60 days' written notice.
I. Indemnification. The municipality shall indemnify the company for any
liability, loss, or damage it may suffer due to violation of the intellectual
property rights of third parties on the EG channel and from claims
arising out of the municipalities' rules for or administration of access.
J. Company use of fallow time. Because blank or under-utilized EG
channels are not in the public interest, in the event the municipality or
other EG access users elect not to fully program their EG access
channel, the company may program unused time on those channels
subject to reclamation by the municipality upon no less than 60 days'
written notice.
A. The company will comply with the Emergency Alert System ("EAS")
rules in accordance with applicable state and federal statues and
regulations.
B. The company shall in no way be held liable for any injury suffered by the
municipality or any other person, during an emergency, if for any
reason the municipality is unable to make full use of the cable television
system as contemplated herein.

§ A261-63. Incorporation of application.
All of the statements and commitments contained in the application or
annexed thereto and incorporated therein, and any amendment thereto,
except as modified herein, are binding upon the company as terms and
conditions of this consent. The application and other relevant writings
submitted by the company shall be annexed hereto and made a part hereof
by reference, provided same do not conflict with applicable state or federal
law.
§ A261-64. Competitive equity.
Should the municipality grant a franchise to construct, operate and
maintain a cable television system to any other person, corporation or entity
on terms materially less burdensome or more favorable than the terms
contained herein, the company may substitute such language that is more
favorable or less burdensome for the comparable provision of this ordinance
subject to the provisions of N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7.
§ A261-65. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
ordinance is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court
or federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and its validity or
unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
the ordinance.
§ A261-66. Third-party beneficiaries.
Nothing in this franchise or in any prior agreement is or was intended to
confer third-party beneficiary status on any member of the public to enforce
the terms of such agreements or franchise.
§ A261-67. When effective.
