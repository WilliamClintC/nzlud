(1) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation or violations of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or
tenant is adjudged by the Court to have violated any provision of
the regulations governing affordable housing units the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the Court:
(a) A fine of not more than $500 per day or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or both, provided that each and
every day that the violation continues or exists shall be
considered a separate and specific violation of these provisions
and not a continuation of the initial offense;
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment into the Borough of Collingswood
Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of rent
illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable
relocation costs, as determined by the Court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the
§ 85-19 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 85-20
77:92
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as
if the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderateincome
unit.
(a) The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at
which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating
owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the
amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase
money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his
right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed
pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
(b) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to
satisfy the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior
liens upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if
any, shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's
sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all
costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in
such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such
earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such
balance within the two-year period shall automatically result in
a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest
accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether
such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the
municipality.
(c) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the
regulations governing affordable housing units shall not
extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing
affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and
moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser
at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The
owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this
plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means

the open space extending across the full width of the lot between
the rear lot line and a line parallel to the rear lot line through the
nearest point of the principal building to the rear lot line. The "side
yard" of the property shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
with § 141-4 of the Borough Code to mean an open space extending

G. Professional escrows.
(1) Generally, this section of this chapter includes all escrow sums
required in connection with any application under this chapter.
These escrow sums are in addition to the fees required by
Subsections A, B and C above which are designed to cover the
administrative costs incurred by the Borough in processing
applications. These escrow sums are also in addition to the
inspection fees and guaranty requirements contained in § 141-11 of
this article. Both the above stated fees and the escrow sums
required by this section are nonrefundable in nature. The escrow
sums are designed to pay the cost of professional review by the
engineer, solicitor or other professionals employed by the
reviewing agency to review and make recommendations on an
applicant's application for development. At the time of submitting
his application and plans to the administrative officer, the applicant
shall be required to execute an escrow agreement between the
applicant and the reviewing agency to cover the costs of technical
and professional review of the application for development. Said
escrow agreement shall be in the form approved by the Solicitor of
the Borough of Collingswood. The escrow agreement shall provide
that the applicant pay all necessary and reasonable costs incurred
by the technical and professional staff employed by the reviewing
agency for review of the applicant's application for development.
The sums specified below are estimates which shall be posted prior
to consideration by the reviewing agency or its staff of that stage of
the applicant's review process indicated. In the event that more
than the sums specified below are required to pay the reasonable
cost incurred, the applicant shall, prior to being permitted to take
§ 141-13 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 141-13
131:202
the next step in the approval procedure or in any element of his
project, pay all additional sums required. In the event that the
escrow sums posted are more than those required, the excess
funds shall be returned to the applicant within 14 days of the
issuance of an occupancy permit for any element of the project.
Prior to issuance of an occupancy permit for any element of the
project seeking approval under this chapter, the administrative
officer shall determine from the professional staff employed by the
reviewing agency in the review of the applicant's application for
development whether there are any additional sums required to
be paid from the escrow fund established. In the event that there
are, the administrative officer shall so notify the Borough Treasurer
of the amounts to be held in that account. The administrative
officer shall determine the position of all escrow accounts, and
where additional funds are required, it shall be the obligation of
the administrative officer to so notify the applicant of the amounts
needed and to properly make all payments required to be made
under this section of this chapter. In addition to these terms, the
escrow agreement may require any other additional terms which
are agreed to by the applicant and the reviewing agency.

additional sum equal to 1/4 of the escrow fee normally established
for the proposal as set forth above.
(4) Rules of construction.
(a) Cumulative sum. Where an applicant submits an application
involving a combination of approvals, i.e., a subdivision
application submitted, together with a variance request, the
fees and escrow sums provided in Subsection F(2) of this
section for each category of approval sought shall be posted.
Therefore, the fees and escrow sums under this section shall
be deemed cumulative in nature.
(b) Waiver. The reviewing board shall have the power in
appropriate cases to compromise or waive the escrow sums
required in Subsection F(2) of this section where an applicant
shall present to the reviewing board sufficient proof that the
cost incurred by the Borough would not necessitate posting of
the specified sums.
A. Before the recording of final subdivision plats or as a condition of final
site plan approval or as a condition to the issuance of a zoning permit
pursuant to Section 52d of this Act,47 the approving authority may
require and shall accept, in accordance with the standards adopted by
ordinance for the purpose of assuring the installation and maintenance
of on-tract improvements:
(1) The furnishing of a performance guaranty in favor of the
municipality in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of
installation for improvements it may deem necessary or
appropriate, including streets, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs,
sidewalks, streetlighting, surveyor's monuments as shown on the
final map and required by the Map Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c.141

sanitary sewers or other means of sewage disposal, drainage
structures, erosion control and sedimentation control devices and
public improvements of open space.
(2) Provision for a maintenance guaranty to be posted with the
governing body for a period not to exceed two years after final
acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed 15% of
the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental
agencies or public utilities to be installed or the improvements are
covered by a performance or maintenance guaranty to another
governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty, as
the case may be, shall be required by the municipality for such
utilities or improvements.
B. The provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53b, c, d, e, f and g shall be applicable
to such performance and maintenance guaranties.
C. Prior to construction of any of the improvements referred to in
Subsection A(1) of this section, the developer shall arrange for a
preconstruction conference between the developer, the contractor and
the Municipal Engineer. The Municipal Engineer shall be notified, by
certified mail, by the developer at least 72 hours in advance of the start
of construction. The cost of inspections shall be the responsibility of the
developer, who shall reimburse the Borough for all reasonable
inspection fees by submitting a certified check or bank money order to
the Borough Clerk. This fee shall be in addition to the amount of the
performance guaranty and all application fees, as outlined above, and
shall be deposited initially in accordance with the following schedule.
The funds shall be deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account.
Upon completion of the development and all inspections, the developer
shall receive an accounting of the expended funds. Any unspent funds
shall be returned to the developer. Should the initial deposit be
insufficient to cover inspection costs, the developer shall deposit
additional sums upon notice from the Borough Clerk, each additional
deposit being in amounts not to exceed 50% of the initial deposit:
Estimated Construction Cost Inspection Fee
Under $5,000 $350.00

development approval.
The approving authority, when acting upon applications for preliminary or
minor subdivision approval or for preliminary or minor site plan approval,
shall have the power to grant such exceptions from the requirements of
subdivision approval or site plan approval, as the case may be, as may
be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the provisions
for subdivision/site plan review and approval if the literal enforcement of
one or more provisions of this chapter is impracticable or will exact undue
hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question.
§ 141-28. Site plan approval required unless exempt.
Site plan approval is required for all site plans not defined herein as exempt.
§ 141-29. Exemption for certain minor and exempt subdivisions and
site plans.

and exempt subdivisions and site plans, except where a variance or
conditional use is part of the application. Divisions of land not considered a
subdivision under the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-7 shall be exempt from
compliance with the subdivision requirements of this chapter.
§ 141-30. Simultaneous review.
The approving authority shall have the power to act upon subdivisions,
conditional uses or site plans simultaneously without the developer making
further application or the approving authority holding further hearings. The
longest time period for action by the approving authority, whether it is for
subdivision, conditional use or site plan approval, shall apply. Whenever

DATE PLANNING DIRECTOR
B. The Planning Board may waive notice and public hearing for an
application for development if it finds that the application for
development conforms to the definition of minor subdivisions set forth
in this chapter. Minor subdivision approval shall be deemed to be final
approval of the subdivision by the Board, provided that the Board may
condition such approval on terms ensuring the provision of
improvements pursuant to this chapter.
C. Minor subdivision approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days of
the date of submission of a complete application or within such further
time as may be consented to by the applicant. Failure of the Planning
Board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute minor
subdivision approval, and a certificate of the Secretary of the Planning
Board as to the failure of the Planning Board to act shall be issued on
request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written
endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required and shall be
so accepted by the County Clerk for purposes of filing subdivision plats.
D. Except as provided in Subsection F of this section, approval of a minor
subdivision shall expire 190 days from the date on which the resolution
of municipal approval is adopted unless, within such period, a plat in
conformity with such approval and the provisions of the Map Filing Law,
N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq., or a deed clearly describing the approved
minor subdivision is filed by the developer with the county recording
officer, the Borough Engineer and the Borough Tax Assessor. Any such
plat or deed accepted for such filing shall have been signed by the
Chairman and Secretary of the Planning Board. In reviewing the
application for development for a proposed minor subdivision, the
Planning Board may accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing
Act, provided that, if the developer chooses to file the minor subdivision
§ 141-33 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION § 141-33
131:227
§ 141-34. Minor site plans.
as provided herein by plat rather than deed, such plat shall conform to
the provisions of said Act.
E. The zoning district requirements and general terms and conditions,
whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision
approval was granted, shall not be changed for a period of two years
after the date on which the resolution of minor subdivision approval is
adopted, provided that the approved minor subdivision shall have been
duly recorded as provided herein.
F. The Planning Board may extend the one-hundred-ninety-day period for
filing a minor subdivision plat or deed pursuant to Subsection E of this
section if the developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Planning Board that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or
indirectly, from filing because of delays in obtaining legally required
approvals from other governmental or quasi-governmental entities and
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the
required approvals. The length of the extension shall be equal to the
period of delay caused by the wait for the required approvals, as
determined by the Planning Board. The developer may apply for the
extension either before or after what would otherwise be the expiration
date.
G. The Planning Board shall grant an extension of minor subdivision
approval for a period determined by the Board but not exceeding one
year from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer
proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the developer
was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with
the development because of delays in obtaining legally required
approvals from other governmental entities and that the developer
applied promptly for and diligently pursued the required approvals. A
developer shall apply for the extension before what would otherwise be
the expiration date of minor subdivision approval or before the 91st day
after the developer receives the last legally required approval from
other governmental entities, whichever occurs later.

§ 141-38 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 141-39
131:240
extension shall so extend the time within which the approving authority
is required to act.

application for development shall be submitted and shall proceed as in
the case of the original application for development.
G. The approving authority shall grant final approval if the application
conforms to the standards of this chapter, the conditions of preliminary
approval and, in the case of a major subdivision, the standards

§ 141-41. Rights conferred by preliminary approval for a major
subdivision and major site plan.
A. Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from the
signing of the plat unless, within such period, the plat shall have been
duly filed by the developer with the County Clerk. The approving
authority may, for good cause shown, extend the period for recording
for an additional period not to exceed 190 days from the date of signing
of the plat. The Planning Board may extend the ninety-five- or onehundred-
ninety-day signing period if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the developer was barred or
prevented, directly or indirectly, from filing because of delays in
obtaining legally required approvals from other governmental agencies
and that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the
required approvals. The length of extension shall be equal to the period
of delay caused by the wait for the required approvals, as determined
by the Planning Board. The developer may apply for an extension either
before or after the original expiration date.
B. No subdivision plat shall be accepted for filing by the county recording
officer until it has been approved by the Planning Board as indicated on
the instrument of signature of the Chairman and the Secretary of the
approving authority or a certificate has been issued pursuant to
Sections 35, 38, 44, 48, 54, or 63 of P.L. 1975, c. 291. The signatures of
the Chairman and Secretary of the approving authority shall not be
affixed until the applicant has posted the appropriate guarantees.
A. Preliminary approval of a major subdivision or major site plan, except
as provided in Subsection B of this section, shall confer upon the
applicant the following rights for a three-year period from the date on
which the resolution of preliminary approval is adopted:
(1) That the general terms and conditions on which preliminary
approval was granted should not be changed, including but not
limited to use requirements; layout and design standards for
streets, curbs and sidewalks, if any; lot size; yard dimensions and
off-tract improvements; and in the case of a site plan, existing
natural resources to be preserved on the site; vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, parking and loading; screening, landscaping
and location of structures; and exterior lighting both for safety
reasons and streetlighting; except that nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent the Borough from modifying by ordinance
such general terms and conditions of preliminary approval as relate
to public health and safety.
(2) That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before the
expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or a section or
sections of the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan.
(3) That the applicant may apply for and the reviewing board may
grant extensions of such preliminary approval for additional

major site plan.
periods of at least one year, but not to exceed a total extension of
two years, provided that, if the design standards have been revised
by ordinance, such revised standards may govern.
B. Whenever the Planning Board grants an extension of preliminary
approval pursuant to Subsection A(3) of this section and preliminary
approval has expired before the date on which the extension is granted,
the extension shall begin on what would otherwise be the expiration
date. The developer may apply for the extension either before or after
what would otherwise be the expiration date.
C. The Planning Board shall grant an extension of preliminary approval for
a period determined by the Board but not exceeding one year from what
would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the developer was barred or
prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the development
because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly for and
diligently pursued the required approvals. A developer shall apply for
the extension before what would otherwise be the expiration date of
preliminary approval or before the 91st day after the developer
receives the last legally required approval from other governmental
entities, whichever occurs later. An extension granted pursuant to this
subsection shall not preclude the Planning Board from granting an
extension to Subsection A(3) of this section.
A. Requirements applicable to the preliminary approval first granted and
all other rights conferred upon the developer pursuant to this chapter,
whether conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of
two years after the date on which the resolution of final approval is
adopted, provided that, in the case of major subdivisions, the rights
conferred by this section shall expire if the plat has not been duly
recorded within the time period provided in this chapter. If the
developer has followed the standards prescribed for final approval and,
in the case of a subdivision, has duly recorded the plat as required in
this chapter, the reviewing board may extend such period of protection
for extensions of one year, but not to exceed three extensions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the granting of
final approval terminates the time period of preliminary approval
pursuant to this chapter for the section granted final approval.
B. Whenever the Planning Board grants an extension of final approval
pursuant to Subsection A of this section and final approval has expired
before the date on which the extension is granted, the extension shall
begin on what would otherwise be the expiration date. The developer
may apply for the extension either before or after what would otherwise
be the expiration date.
§ 141-41 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 141-42
131:244
C. The Planning Board shall grant an extension of final approval for a
period determined by the Board but not exceeding one year from what
would otherwise be the expiration date if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the developer was barred or
prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the development
because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly for and
diligently pursued these approvals. A developer shall apply for the
extension before what would otherwise be the expiration date of final
approval or before the 91st day after the developer receives the last
legally required approval from other governmental entities, whichever
occurs later. An extension granted pursuant to this subsection shall not
preclude the Planning Board from granting an extension pursuant to
Subsection A of this section.

ARTICLE VIII
Design and Performance Standards
§ 141-43. Compliance required.
All developments shall conform to design standards encouraging sound
development patterns within the Borough. In cases of conflicting
requirements in the Code, the more stringent sections of the Code would
apply in all cases.
§ 141-44. (Reserved)61
§ 141-45. Accessory structures.
§ 141-46. Adult entertainment uses.
A. Any accessory building attached to a principal building is part of the
principal building and shall adhere to the yard requirements for the
principal building.
B. The minimum distance of any accessory building to a property line shall
be five feet and to any building on the same lot shall be 10 feet.
C. Accessory buildings shall not exceed 15 feet in height and on residential
lots shall not exceed 500 square feet in floor area. The coverage of an
accessory building shall count toward the total building coverage on the
lot.
D. An accessory building may be erected in the side or rear yard only. If
erected on a corner lot, it shall be set back from the side street to
comply with the setback line applying to the principal building.
E. No barn, building or structure of a temporary nature, garage,
outbuilding or shack shall be placed, erected or permitted to be used,
either temporarily or permanently, on any lot or parcel of land for living
or sleeping purposes in any district, except as permitted as an
accessory apartment. (Refer to § 141-44). No tent shall be placed,
erected or permitted to be used, either temporarily or permanently, on
any lot or parcel of land for living or sleeping purposes in any district,
except that the placing of a tent in the rear yard of a premises for

A. Statutory authorization; findings of fact; purpose and objectives.
(1) Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey
has delegated the responsibility to the local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and

§ 141-43 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION § 141-46
131:247
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Borough of
Collingswood and State of New Jersey does ordain as follows.
(2) Findings of fact. Adult entertainment and sexually oriented
businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses
around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to
them; cause increased crime, especially prostitution; adversely
affect property values; create an atmosphere which is inimical to
the values of a significant segment of the Borough's population;
and encourage residents and businesses to move elsewhere. It is
further recognized that sexually oriented businesses, when located
in close proximity to each other, contribute to urban blight and
downgrade the quality of life in the adjacent areas.
(3) Purpose and objectives. It is the purpose of this section to regulate
sexually oriented businesses to minimize and control the adverse
effects recognized in Subsection A(2) and to promote the public

ARTICLE IX
Signs
§ 141-92. Purpose.
The provisions of this article shall apply to the construction, erection,
alteration, use, type, number, location, size, design, and maintenance of
all signs. This article is intended to regulate and control signs and their
placement and construction throughout the Borough of Collingswood for
the following purposes:
A. To provide a pleasing overall environmental setting and good
community appearance, deemed vital to the continued economic
attractiveness of Collingswood by:
(1) Encouraging signs in areas of high sign concentration, such as
downtown, neighborhood retail areas, and highway corridors, so
that the placement, color, shape, brackets, support structures,
mountings, design and lighting promote good civic design that
supports the visual quality and positive collective impact and image
of such areas.
(2) Promoting signs that, in addition to the standards herein, are also
integrated with the overall design of their host building in a way
respectful of and complimentary to the historic and architectural
character of the building.
(3) Permitting signs that not only identify the "presence" of the
business or use on a thoroughfare, but also generate a positive
collective impact upon the streetscape of an area.
B. To create a more productive, enterprising, professional business
atmosphere.
C. To allow signs appropriate to the architectural and planned character
and development of each zoning district.
D. To ensure that permitted signs do not become a safety hazard or
nuisance.
E. To promote traffic safety.
F. To promote the design of signs in pedestrian corridors that focus upon
pedestrian viewers and not automobile operators.
G. To prevent business and advertising signs from conflicting with public
safety signs.
H. To prevent the overcrowding of land through multiple proliferation of
signs on a single parcel of land.
I. To facilitate fire and police protection by proper sign identification.

ordinary sign maintenance. Alteration of the lettering or message on an
approved changeable copy sign is exempted from this requirement. Any
sign replacing an existing sign shall conform to the provisions of this
chapter.
B. No nonconforming sign shall be replaced in the event of its removal or
destruction. If a nonconforming sign is deemed damaged badly enough

abandoned or a danger to the public health or public safety, he shall
give written notice of the condition of the sign to the owner of the sign
and to the owner of record of the tax lot.
C. The property owner shall thereafter have 10 days to repair or remove

131:300
(2) Location of signs.
(a) A sign must be on the tax lot, building, or storefront with which
it is identified. No signs shall be allowed for or on accessory
buildings or structures.
(b) No sign shall be erected in a public right-of-way or between the
street curb and a sidewalk, other than an easel sign, projecting
sign, or awning sign, as permitted in this chapter .
(c) Freestanding signs shall be set back at least 10 feet from the
public right-of-way or the front curb line, whichever is greater,
except in the Professional Office District and all residential
districts, where they shall be set back at least five feet from the
public right-of-way or the front curb line, whichever is greater.
All freestanding signs shall be set back at least 10 feet from the
property's side yard line.
(d) No freestanding sign taller than four feet shall be erected in
any sight triangle at a street intersection or ingress or egress
points to a lot.
(e) No wall sign shall extend over any window or door, nor shall
any wall sign be suspended or project over any part of a
building or structure unless it meets the conditions of
§ 141-101D(10).
(f) A sign must be positioned on a building facade's architectural
sign band, if provided.
(3) Computation of sign area. The sign area of any sign shall be
computed by determining the area of the smallest quadrilateral
into which the sign can be fit, inclusive of decorative borders and
other design elements, as permitted by this chapter. In the case of
double-sided signs, the sign area shall be measured by using the
area of only one side of the sign. The sign structure shall not be
included as a portion of the sign area, provided that no identifying
or advertising message is displayed on the sign structure.
(4) Lighting.
(a) Illumination of a sign shall be arranged so that no substantial
light or glare is directed or reflected onto adjacent streets or
properties. The installation and assembly shall meet all
applicable building and electrical codes.
(b) An application for an illuminated sign must include a lighting
fixture catalogue cut or manufacturer's product description
sheet with isolux or lumens specifications and mounting
information. It shall indicate the lighting intensity (lumens)
that would be generated by any lighting devices shining onto
the sign and the rest of the property and neighboring
§ 141-101 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION § 141-101
131:301
properties and the lumens that would be projecting from any
illuminated signs as part of the sign plan. (This information is
part of the manufacturer's data sheet.) Externally illuminated
signs consisting of three or fewer one-hundred-watt
incandescent light bulbs, or compact fluorescent lights of
comparable wattage, shall be exempt from submitting a
lumens plan. In no instance shall the lighting intensity of any
sign, whether resulting from internal illumination or external
illumination, exceed 20 footcandles when measured with a
standard light meter perpendicular to the face of the sign from
a distance measured one foot from the face of the sign.
(5) Design guidelines. Each sign shall be reviewed under the general
sign design guidelines in § 141-101B in terms of type, size,
appearance, materials, placement, color, lettering, and lighting.
Specific sign design guidelines shall be reviewed under the zoning
district design standards in § 141-101C and specific design
standards in § 141-101D. Signs shall conform to the distinctive
character of the building on which they is located and to their
surrounding neighborhood and streetscape. No sign shall be
permitted if it reduces or impairs pedestrian or vehicular traffic
safety or the visual or architectural integrity of its building or
streetscape in which it is situated.

B. General sign design guidelines.
(1) General guidelines. The sign's design should complement the
design of its host building or site and the overall character of the
business district. Signs should be designed and painted by
professional sign makers or experienced artists. Each sign should
be designed in accordance with the following standards.
(2) Appearance. Signs should be compatible with their surroundings.
In Collingswood's Central Business District zones, signs should
match traditional early and mid twentieth century sign patterns,
i.e., flush-mounted wall signs; window signs; awning signs;
projecting and icon signs; and murals. Small freestanding signs,
which are usually displayed on the lawn in front of a former
dwelling, are more appropriate in the Professional Office District
zones. All of these signs also would be compatible with the highway
streetscape in the Highway Business District and Highway
Industrial District zones, as well as pylons signs and illuminated
signs. Signs for businesses in a common building, shopping, office,
or industrial center should be compatible with each other too.
Signs that relate to and complement their surroundings will
capture the attention of a pedestrian or motorist better than a
poorly designed one, which may give a negative impression of the
business and the community as a whole. Signs attached to the same
building should be the same shape, color and height, regardless of
individual business ownership or tenancy in the building
(3) Materials. High-quality materials will ensure that a sign will look
attractive, reduce maintenance costs, and last longer. Sign
materials and finished textures should complement the building
materials. Permanent signs should be made of wood, high-density
foam simulating wood, medium-density overlay and finished
plywood, brass, copper, or bronze. Generally, signs made of inferior
grade unfinished wood and plastic are inappropriate and
discouraged. Cotton, vinyl, and mixed fabrics should be used for
awning signs. Plastic and lexan materials should be used for
internally illuminated signs.
(4) Placement. Many buildings have spaces that are specifically
designed for signs, such as the area below the second floor
§ 141-101 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 141-101
131:304
windowsill or on a building or sign fascia. Signs should be
integrated with the building without obscuring important
architectural details or storefront windows. Signs should be
mounted so as to minimize damage to historic materials. Sign
supports should be finished with architectural details to
complement the sign, such as ornamental iron or brass supports
and routed wood posts and edges to provide detail and relief.
Window and door signs should avoid cluttering and blocking views.
This will help increase customer interest and business visibility,
viability, and safety.
(5) Lettering. Lettering and character typefaces should match the
scale of the building and size of the sign. Signs should be legible
from a typical viewing position and travel speeds. For example,
lettering in the Central Business District zone should be visible to
pedestrians and slower moving traffic. Signs along highway
corridors may have lettering that is legible from quicker moving
traffic. Inappropriate typefaces have characters that are difficult to
read and incompatibly styled for their host building, site, or
district. While cursive style typefaces may be appropriate for
pedestrian-oriented signs, they would be difficult to read in an
automobile-oriented business zone. Hard-to-read, faddish, and
intricate typefaces should be avoided.
(6) Color. Colors influence a sign's legibility, character, and general
appearance. The colors should be compatible with the style and
color scheme of the building and its neighbors. Color schemes
should be kept simple, limited to two or three colors, and based on
a host building's painted exterior detailing, such as window trim
and cornices. Earth tones, primary colors, and pastels are
appropriate and can be designed with subtle combinations and
variations. Fluorescent, luminescent, and iridescent colors and
tones should only be used for traffic safety signs. Signs with a
strong color contrast are more legible. A sign with a dark
background will make lighter lettering more visible. Because
storefront windows usually appear dark, window signs should be
done in light colored paint or gold leaf.
(7) Lighting. Collingswood encourages the use of decorative light
fixtures, such as gooseneck, hooded, historic reproduction, and
alcove fixtures, complimentary to the design of building, sign, or
site. Direct external illumination should be used in all districts.
Internally illuminated signs, however, are appropriate in the
Highway Business District and Highway Industrial District zones.
Neon lights should be used only in the Central Business District
zones on buildings where it was used as a primary signage element
before 1960 or on modern buildings with compatible architectural
styling, as determined by the Historic Preservation Commission.
Signs should be evenly lit with no isolated bright or dark spots. No
§ 141-101 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION § 141-101
131:305
substantial light or glare may be directed or reflected onto adjacent
streets or properties.
C. Zoning district design standards.
(1) Historic districts. In addition to conforming to the other regulations
contained in this chapter, historic identification signs and internally
illuminated signs, except as permitted in the Highway Business
District and Highway Industrial District, are subject to the review
by the Historic Preservation Commission in accordance with Article
X of this chapter .

written report which may have been submitted.
B. The Commission's recommendations shall focus on how the proposed
undertaking would affect a site or district's historic or architectural
significance as outlined in § 141-103A of this article. In considering the
§ 141-104 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 141-105
131:326
§ 141-106. Review of application pertaining to regulated activities
by Historic Preservation Commission.
The Zoning Officer shall refer all applications for permits pertaining to
regulated activities on an historic site, or within an historic district, to the
Commission for a written report on the application of the zoning provisions
concerning historic preservation to any of those aspects of the change
proposed, which were not determined by approval of an application for
development by a municipal agency, pursuant to the Municipal Land Use
Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. The Commission shall submit its report on
the application to the Zoning Officer within 45 days of his referral of
the application to the Commission. If, within the forty-five-day period, the
Commission recommends to the Zoning Officer against the issuance of a
permit, or recommends conditions to the permit to be issued, the Zoning
Officer shall deny issuance of a permit or include the conditions in the
permit, as the case may be. Failure of the Commission to report within
the forty-five-day period shall be deemed to constitute a report in favor of
issuance of the permit and without the recommendation of conditions to the
permit.
§ 141-107. Standards for review by Historic Preservation
Commission.
Commission's recommendations, the Planning Board and the Board of
Adjustment shall be guided by the review standards established in
§ 141-107 of this article.
C. On all matters referred to the Commission which require approval or
action by the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the
decision of the Commission shall be a recommendation only, which may
be approved, disapproved or amended by the Planning Board or the
Board of Adjustment. In the event that the Planning Board or the Board
of Adjustment should disapprove or amend the decision of the
Commission, it shall state its reasons therefor at a public hearing and in
its resolution of memorialization.
A. In regard to all applications, the Commission shall be guided by the
following standards:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
§ 141-105 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION § 141-107
131:327
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event that replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated
by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural materials and when such design is compatible with the
size, scale, color, material and character of the property,
neighborhood or environment.
(10) Wherever possible, new additions and alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations
were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity
of the structure would be unimpaired.
(11) Efforts to preserve the architectural features and historical
integrity of a property or specific feature of that property should be
consistent with the intent and purpose of the Boroughs
Development Regulations and the Boroughs Master Plan. The
time, resources, and costs determined to be necessary to preserve
the architectural features and historical integrity of a property
located within a historic district shall be considered by the
Commission and balanced against the market value of the property
§ 141-107 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 141-107
131:328
and any substantial economic hardship that may be sustained by an
applicant. In rendering its decision, the Commission shall consider
an applicants proposed use of alternative and less expensive
materials and methods of preservation. Commission members shall
provide reasons for their decision which shall be memorialized
in the Commissions resolution. [Added 3-3-2018 by Ord. No.
1634]
B. In regard to applications for new construction, additions and
alterations, the following visual compatibility factors shall be
considered:
(1) Height. The height of the proposed building shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(2) The proportion of a building's front facade. The relationship of the
width of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(3) The proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of
the width of the windows to the height of the windows in a building
shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which
it is visually related.
(4) The rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of
solids to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(5) The rhythm of spacing and buildings on streets. The relationship of
the building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings
shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which
it is visually related.
(6) The rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. The relationship
of the entrance and porch projections to the street shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(7) The relationship of materials, texture and color. The relationship of
the materials, texture and color of the facade and roof of a building
shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in
the buildings to which it is visually related.
(8) Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings to which it is visually related.
(9) Walls of continuity. Appurtenances of a building such as walls,
open-type fencing and evergreen landscape masses shall form
cohesive walls of enclosure along a street to the extent necessary
§ 141-107 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION § 141-107
131:329
to maintain visual compatibility of the building with the buildings
and places to which it is visually related.
(10) The scale of a building. The size of a building, the mass of a
building in relation to open spaces, the windows, door openings,
porches and balconies shall be visually compatible with the
buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(11) The directional expression of the front elevation. A building shall
be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related in its directional character, whether this be vertical
character, horizontal character or nondirectional character.
(12) Exterior features. A structure's related exterior features, such as
lighting, fences, signs, sidewalks, driveways and parking areas,
shall be compatible with the features of those structures to which it
is visually related and shall be appropriate for the historic period
for which the structure is significant.
C. In regard to applications to demolish an historic site or any
improvement within an historic district, the following matters shall be
considered:
(1) Its historic, architectural, cultural or scenic significance in relation
to the criteria established in this article.
(2) If it is within an historic district, its significance to the district and
the probable impact of its removal on the character and ambience
of the district and the criteria which were the basis of the
designation of the district.
(3) Its potential for use for those purposes currently permitted by
zoning regulations.
(4) Its structural condition and the economic feasibility of alternatives
to the proposal.
(5) Its importance to the Borough and the extent to which its historical
or architectural value is such that its removal would be detrimental
to the public interest.
(6) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon design,
craftsmanship, texture or material that it would not be reproduced
or could be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense.
(7) The extent to which its retention would promote the general
welfare by maintaining and increasing the real estate values,
generating business, attracting tourists, attracting new residents,
stimulating interest and study in architecture and design or making
the Borough an attractive and desirable place in which to live.

131:330
§ 141-108. Effect of project approval or denial by Historic
Preservation Commission; appeals.
D. In regard to applications to move an historic site or any building or
structure in an historic district to a new location, the following matters
shall be considered:
(1) The historic loss to the site of the original location and, if the
present location is within an historic district, to the historic district
as a whole.
(2) The reasons for not retaining the landmark or structure at its
present site.
(3) The compatibility, nature and character of the current and of the
proposed surrounding areas as they relate to the protection of the
interest and values referred to in this article.
(4) If the proposed new location is within an historic district, visual
compatibility factors as set forth in Subsection B.
(5) The probability of significant damage to the landmark or structure
itself.
(6) If it is to be removed from the Borough, the proximity of the
proposed new location to the Borough, including the accessibility
to the residents of the Borough and other citizens.
A. Approval. Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed
to be final approval pursuant to this article. Such approval shall neither
cause nor prevent the filing of any collateral application or other
proceeding required by any other Borough ordinance to be made prior
to undertaking the action requested concerning the site or the
structure in an historic district.
B. Denial. Denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed to
preclude the applicant from undertaking the activity applied for.
C. Appeals. The granting of denial of a certificate of appropriateness may
be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in the same manner as an
appeal is taken pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70a. Nothing herein shall
be deemed to limit the right of judicial review of the Borough action
after an appeal is concluded by the Board of Adjustment.
D. Demolitions. In its review of applications for demolition of an historic
landmark or an improvement of an historic district, pursuant to
§ 141-104, the Commission may recommend the postponement of
demolition for a period not to exceed one year. The Commission shall
utilize this time period to consult with the governing body, the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy or other
similarly qualified organizations to ascertain how the Borough may
preserve the premises to be demolished. The Commission shall be
§ 141-107 CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION § 141-108
131:331
§ 141-109. Enforcement; violation; notice; failure to comply.
empowered to assist the owner in developing plans to preserve the
structure when moving or demolition would be a great loss to the
Borough. The Commission shall be empowered to negotiate with the
applicant to see if an alternative to demolition can be found and may
require the applicant to prepare a financial analysis which may include
any or all of the following:
(1) The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the
party from whom purchased, including a description of the
relationship, whether business or familial, if any, between the
owner and the person from whom the property was purchased.
(2) The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon
according to the most recent assessment.
(3) For depreciable properties, a pro forma financial statement
prepared by an accountant or broker of record.
(4) All appraisals obtained by the owner in connection with his
purchase or financing of the property or during his ownership of
the property.
(5) Bona fide offers of the property for sale or rent, the price asked and
offers received, if any.
(6) Any consideration given by the owner as to profitable, adaptive
uses for the property.
E. The Commission shall study the question of economic hardship for the
applicant and shall determine whether the site or the property in the
historic district can be put to reasonable beneficial use without the
approval of the demolition application. In the case of an incomeproducing
building, the Commission shall also determine whether the
applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his existing building. The
Commission may ask applicants for additional information to be used in
making these determinations.
A. Any person who shall undertake any activity which affects an historic
site or an improvement within an historic district and which requires a
certificate of appropriateness, without obtaining the review of the
Commission, shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter.
B. Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer shall personally serve
upon the owner of the lot whereon the violation is occurring a notice
describing the violation in detail, and giving the owner 10 days to abate
the violation by restoring the site or improvement to the condition it
was prior to the violation. If the owner cannot be personally served
within the Borough with said notice, a copy shall be posted on the site
and a copy sent to the owner at his last known address as it appears on
the Borough tax rolls.
§ 141-108 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 141-109
131:332
§ 141-110. Limitation on duties and powers of Historic Preservation
Commission.
No duties or powers of the Commission shall supersede or infringe on the
powers of other Borough boards or committees.
§ 141-111. Listing of historic district properties.
The listing of historic district properties is attached hereto and made a part
hereof.75
C. In the event that the violation is not abated within 10 days of service or
posting on site, whichever is earlier, the Zoning Officer shall cause to be
instituted any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such
unlawful activity; to restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent
the occupancy of said building, structure or land; or to prevent any
illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises.
D. If any person shall undertake any activity requiring a certificate of
appropriateness without first having obtained approval, he or she shall
be required to immediately stop the activity, apply for approval and take
any necessary measures to preserve the landmarks affected pending a
decision. If the project is denied, he shall immediately restore the site to
its preactivity status. The Zoning Officer is hereby authorized to seek
injunctive relief regarding a stop action on restoration in the Superior
Court, Chancery Division, not less than 10 days after the delivery of
notice pursuant to Subsection B hereof.
E. In the event that any action which would permanently and adversely
change an historic site or historic district or that a demolition to remove
the site is about to occur without approval having been issued, the
Zoning Officer is empowered to apply to the Superior Court of New
Jersey for injunctive relief as is necessary to prevent such actions.

(2) The boundaries of the real property which is owned by or leased to
such schools or a school board.
(3) That such school property is and continues to be used for school
purposes.

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization; Findings of Fact; Purpose and Objectives
§ 167-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq.
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Commissioners of Collingswood
Borough of Camden County, New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 167-2. Findings of fact.
§ 167-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Collingswood Borough are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 167-1 DRUG PARAPHERNALIA; DRUG AND DRUNK- § 167-3
149:371
§ 167-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone.

shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Borough Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH Zone on a
community's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) with a one-percentannual
or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. It is shown on the FIRM as Zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO, A1-A30,
AE, A99, or AH.
BASE FLOOD  A flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS) including the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). For Zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30 the elevation represents
the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For Zones
VE and V1-30, the elevation represents the stillwater elevation (SWEL) plus
wave effect (BFE = SWEL + wave effect) resulting from a flood that has a
one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

149:373
COASTAL A ZONE  The portion of the special flood hazard area (SFHA)
starting from a Velocity (V) Zone and extending up to the landward limit
of the moderate wave action delineation. Where no V Zone is mapped, the
Coastal A Zone is the portion between the open coast and the landward limit
of the moderate wave action delineation. Coastal A Zones may be subject to
wave effects, velocity flows, erosion, scour, or a combination of these forces.
Construction and development in Coastal A Zones is to be regulated the
same as V Zones/coastal high-hazard areas.
COASTAL HIGH-HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along
an open coast and any other area subject to high-velocity wave action from
storms or seismic sources.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or
storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood
hazard.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM)  The official map on
which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas
of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building built, in the case of a
building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated
floor or, in the case of a building in a Coastal A Zone, to have the bottom
of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated floor, elevated
above the base flood elevation plus freeboard by means of piling, columns
(posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water, and
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an area of
special flood hazard, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated
by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In Areas of Coastal
A Zones "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls.
EROSION  The process of the gradual wearing away of land masses.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to
be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  The official map on which the
Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS  Zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion
control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term
describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which
provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without accumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than
0.2 foot.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE  The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed or existing walls of a
structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE  Any structure that is:

affected by waves greater than 1.5 feet during the base flood. Base flood
conditions between the V Zone and the LiMWA will be similar to, but less
severe than those in the V Zone.
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, useable solely for
the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than
a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered.
As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
§ 167-15 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 167-15
149:384
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

149:389
§ 167-18. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 167-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
§ 167-19. Coastal A Zone.
Coastal A Zones are located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in § 167-7. These areas may be subject to wave effects, velocity
flows, erosion, scour, or a combination of these forces; therefore, the
following provisions shall apply:

more restrictive.
A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If Subsection A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with Article V, Provisions for Flood Hazard
Reduction.
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
accumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 foot at any
point.
A. Location of structures.
(1) All buildings or structures shall be located landward of the reach of

in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision.
B. Construction methods.
(1) Elevation. All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be elevated on piling or columns so that:
(a) The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding the piling or columns) is elevated to or
above the base flood elevation plus one foot or as required by
ASCE/SEI 24-14, Table 4-1, whichever is more restrictive; and
(b) With all space below the lowest floor's supporting member
open so as not to impede the flow of water, except for
breakaway walls as provided or in Subsection B(4).
(2) Structural support.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
securely anchored on piling or columns.
(b) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water loading values
each of which shall have a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year (one-hundred-year
mean recurrence interval).
(c) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings within
Coastal A Zones on the community's FIRM.
(3) Certification. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
develop or review the structural design specifications and plans for
the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards
of practice for compliance with the provisions of Subsection B(1)
and (2)(a) and (b).
(4) Space below the lowest floor.
(a) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure started after the enactment of this chapter shall not
enclose the space below the lowest floor unless breakaway
walls, open wood lattice-work or insect screening are used as
provided for in this section.
(b) Breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work or insect screening
shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided that
they are intended to collapse under wind and water loads
without causing collapse, displacement or other structural
damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system. Breakaway walls shall be designed for a
§ 167-19 DRUG PARAPHERNALIA; DRUG AND DRUNK- § 167-19
149:391
safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than
20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which
exceed a design safe loading of 20 pounds per square foot
(either by design or when so required by local or state codes)
may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following
conditions.
[1] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
[2] The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects
of wind and water load acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and nonstructural). Water
loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by
applicable state or local building standards.
(c) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage
and not for human habitation.
(d) Prior to construction, plans for any breakaway wall must be
submitted to the Construction Code Official or Building
Subcode Official for approval.
C. Sand dunes. Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes within Coastal
A Zones on the community's DFIRM which would increase potential
flood damage.

221:446
ARTICLE I
Use of Government Buildings and Equipment
[Adopted 6-5-2000 by Ord. No 1219]
§ 221-1. Short title.
An ordinance banning the use of government buildings and equipment for
political fund-raising.
§ 221-2. Purpose.
Whereas, our laws in New Jersey do not presently ban solicitation or
acceptance of political contributions by public office holders and employees
while in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties;
whereas, solicitation and acceptance of political contributions in rooms
and buildings occupied in the discharge of official duties threatens the
independence of public employees, undermine the efficiency of government
by taking officials and employees away from the people's business and
leads to the appearance of improper influence of political contributions on
government functions; whereas, prohibiting the solicitation and acceptance
of political contributions in rooms and buildings occupied in the discharge
of official duties will address these harms and leave open ample alternative
venues for political fund-raising; whereas, our laws in New Jersey do not
presently recognize the misuse of public property for political fund-raising
as a district offense; therefore, it is accordingly found and determined
that the municipality's interest in an independent and efficient government
workforce and a government that is undermined by neither the fact nor
appearance of improper influence of political contributions on government
decisions require the prohibition of political fund-raising in rooms or
buildings occupied in the discharge of official duties or through the use of
public property.
§ 221-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

record of every property included on the abandoned property list.
The published and mailed notices shall identify property
determined to be abandoned setting forth the owner of record and,
if known, the tax lot and block number and street address. The
public officer, in consultation with the Tax Collector, shall also send
out a notice by regular mail to any mortgagee, servicing
organization, or property tax processing organization that receives
a duplicate copy of the tax bill pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-64(d).
(2) When the owner of record is not known for a particular property
and cannot be ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence
by the Tax Collector, notice shall not be mailed but instead shall be
posted on the property in the manner as provided in N.J.S.A.
40:48-2.7. The mailed notice shall indicate the factual basis for the
finding of the public officer, that the property is abandoned
property as that term is defined herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54, and
shall specify the information relied upon in making such finding. In
all cases, a copy of the mailed or posted notice shall also be filed by
the public officer, in the office of the Clerk, County of Camden. This
filing shall have the same force and effect as a formal notice under
N.J.S.A. 2A:15-6. The notice shall be captioned with the name of the
Borough of Collingswood as "Plaintiff" and the name of the
property owner as "Defendant," as though an action had been
commenced by the Borough against the owner.
D. An owner or lienholder may challenge the inclusion of his property on
the abandoned property list by appealing that determination to the
Commissioners within 30 days of the owner's receipt of the certified
§ 228-3 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 228-3
225:478
§ 228-4. Requests for additions to abandoned property list.
notice or 40 days from the date upon which the notice was sent. An
owner whose identity was not known to the public officer shall have
40 days from the date upon which notice was published or posted,
whichever is later, to challenge the inclusion of a property on the
abandoned property list. For good cause shown, the Commissioners
shall accept a late filing of an appeal. Within 30 days of receipt of
a request for an appeal of the findings contained in the notice, the
Commissioners shall schedule a hearing for redetermination of the
matter. Any property included on the list shall be presumed to be
abandoned property unless the owner, through the submission of an
affidavit or certification asserting that the property is not an abandoned
property, can demonstrate that the property was erroneously included
on the list. The affidavit or certification shall be accompanied by
supporting documentation, such as, but not limited to, photographs,
repair invoices, bills and construction contracts. The sole ground for
appeal shall be that the property in question is not abandoned property
as that term is defined herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The
Commissioners shall decide any timely filed appeal within 10 days of
the hearing on the appeal and shall promptly, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, and by regular mail, notify the property owner of the
decision and the reasons therefor.
E. The property owner may challenge an adverse determination of an
appeal with the Commissioners, by instituting, in accordance with the
New Jersey Court Rules, a summary trial proceeding in the Superior
Court, County of Camden. Such action shall be instituted within 20 days
of the date of the notice of decision mailed by the Commissioners. The
sole ground for appeal and new hearing before the Superior Court shall
be that the property in question is not an abandoned property as that
term is defined in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The failure to institute an action of
appeal on a timely basis shall constitute a jurisdictional bar to
challenging the adverse determination, except that, for good cause
shown, the court may extend the deadline for instituting the action.
F. The Borough shall promptly remove any property from the abandoned
property list that has been determined by the Commissioners or on
appeal not to be abandoned and may, in its discretion, remove
properties from said list whenever the Commissioners deem such
removal appropriate under the circumstances.
G. The abandoned property list shall become effective, and the Borough
shall have the right to pursue any legal remedy with respect to
properties on the list, at any time after at least one property has been
placed on the list and following the expiration of the period for appeal
with respect to that first property or upon the denial of an appeal
brought by the property owner of that first property.
A. Any interested party may submit a written request to the
Commissioners asserting that any property within the Borough of
§ 228-3 PRECIOUS METALS AND GEMS § 228-4
225:479
§ 228-5. Sale of tax lien; remediation costs.
Collingswood should be included on the abandoned property list. The
written request must specify the street address and block and lot
number of the property to be included and the grounds for its inclusion.
Within 30 days of receipt of any such request, the Commissioners
shall provide a written response to the party, either indicating that the
property will be added to the abandoned property list or otherwise
stating the Commissioners' reasons for not adding the property. For
the purposes of this section, the term "interested parties" shall include
any resident of the Borough of Collingswood, any owner or operator
of a business within the Borough of Collingswood, or any organization
representing the interests of residents, business owners or otherwise
engaged in furthering the revitalization and improvement of the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
B. Any interested party may participate in a redetermination hearing
regarding the inclusion of a property on the abandoned property list.
Upon written request by any interested party, the Commissioners shall
provide that party with at least 20 days' notice of any such hearing. The
party shall provide the Commissioners with notice at least 10 days
before the hearing of its intention to participate and the nature of the
testimony or other information that it proposes to submit at the
hearing.
A. Sale of tax lien on abandoned property.
(1) Notwithstanding N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 or the provisions of any other law
to the contrary, if a property is included on the abandoned property
list and the property taxes or other Borough liens due on the
property are delinquent six or more quarters as of the date of
expiration of the right to appeal inclusion on the list, or, if an appeal
has been filed, as of the date that all opportunities for appeal of
inclusion on the list have been exhausted, then the tax lien on the
property may be sold in accordance with the procedures in the "Tax
Sale Law," N.J.S.A. 54:5-1 et seq., on or after the 90th day following
the expiration of that time of appeal or final determination on an
appeal, as appropriate.
(2) The Borough may, at its option, require that the sale of the tax sale
certificate or any subsequent assignment or transfer of a tax sale
certificate held by the Borough be subject to the express condition
that the purchaser or assignee shall be obliged to perform and
conclude any rehabilitation or repairs necessary to remove the
property from the abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A.
55:19-55. The Borough may further require that the purchaser or
assignee post a bond in favor of the Borough to guarantee the
rehabilitation or repair of the property. The cost of rehabilitation
and repairs and the cost of the bond shall be added to the amount
required to be paid by the owner for redemption of the property.
§ 228-4 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 228-5
225:480
(3) The public officer may waive a requirement to post a bond imposed
by the Borough for any purchaser, assignee or transferee of a tax
sale certificate that provides documentation acceptable to the
public officer that the purchaser, assignee or transferee is a
qualified rehabilitation entity as defined herein.
(4) The purchaser, assignee or transferee of the tax sale certificate
who is required to rehabilitate and repair the property shall be
required to file the appropriate affidavits with the Tax Collector,
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-62, representing the amounts of monies
expended periodically toward the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. A purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be entitled to
interest on the amounts expended, as set forth in the affidavits, at
the delinquent rate of interest for delinquencies in excess of $1,500
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-67, in effect for the time period when the
amounts were expended.
(5) The tax sale certificate purchaser, assignee or transferee, under
the auspices and with the authority of the Borough, shall be
permitted to enter in and upon the property for the purposes of
appraising the costs of rehabilitation and repair and to perform all
other acts required to guarantee the completion of the
rehabilitation or repair of the property. No rehabilitation or repair
work shall be commenced, however, until proof of adequate liability
insurance and an indemnification agreement holding the Borough
harmless is filed with the public officer. If the tax sale certificate is
not purchased at the initial auction of the tax sale certificate and
the Borough purchases the certificate pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34,
then the Borough is authorized and empowered to convey and
transfer to the authority or any of its subsidiaries, without
receiving compensation therefor, all of its right, title and interest in
that certificate; however, any portion of the amount paid to the Tax
Collector to redeem the tax sale certificate that represents tax or
other Borough lien delinquencies and subsequent Borough liens,
including interest, shall be returned by the Tax Collector of the
Borough.
B. If the Borough acquires the tax sale certificate for a property on the
abandoned property list then, upon 10 days' written notice to the
property owner and any mortgagee as of the date of the filing of the lis
pendens notice under Subsection d. of N.J.S.A. 55:19-55, that entity
shall be permitted to enter upon the property and remediate any
conditions that caused the property to be included on the abandoned
property list. No remediation shall be commenced, however, if within
that ten-day period the owner or mortgagee shall have notified the
Borough or authority or its subsidiary, as appropriate, in writing that
the owner or mortgagee has elected to perform the remediation itself.
When the owner or mortgagee elects to perform the remediation itself,
it shall be required to post bond in favor of the Borough in order to
§ 228-5 PRECIOUS METALS AND GEMS § 228-5
225:481
§ 228-6. Removal of property from list of abandoned properties;
remediation.
ensure performance. The amount and conditions of the bond shall be
determined by the public officer.
C. The cost of remediation incurred by the Borough pursuant to this
section, as so certified by the entity incurring the cost upon completion
of the remediation, shall constitute a lien upon the property first in time
and right to any other lien, whether the other lien was filed prior to, or
after the filing of any lien by the Borough, except for Borough taxes,
lien and assessments and any lien imposed pursuant to the Spill
Compensation and Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq., together
with any interest thereon. The certification of cost shall be filed and
recorded as a lien by the entity incurring the cost with the county clerk
or register of deeds and mortgages, as appropriate, in the county in
which the property is located.
D. Failure of an owner or lienholder to remove a property from the
abandoned property list within the period of time for appeal of inclusion
of the property on the abandoned property list pursuant to this
subsection shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the owner to
continue to maintain the property as abandoned property.
E. The clearance, development, redevelopment, or repair of property
being maintained as an abandoned property pursuant to this chapter
shall be a public purpose and public use, for which the power of
eminent domain may be exercised.
A. An owner may remove a property from the abandoned property list
prior to sale of the tax sale certificate by paying all taxes and Borough
liens due, including interest and penalties and:
(1) By posting cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating all
conditions because of which the property has been determined to
be abandoned pursuant to Section 36 of P.L. 1996, N.J.S.A. 55:19-55
and posting cash or a bond to cover the cost of any environmental
cleanup required on the property, evidenced by a certification by a
licensed engineer retained by the owner and reviewed and
approved by the public officer stating that the cash or bond
adequately covers the cost of the cleanup; or
(2) By demonstrating to the satisfaction of the public officer that the
conditions rendering the property abandoned have been
remediated in full; provided, however, that where the public officer
finds that the owner is actively engaged in remediating the
conditions because of which the property was determined to be
abandoned pursuant to Section 36 of P.L. 1996, N.J.S.A. 55:19-55,
as evidenced by significant rehabilitation activity on the property,
the public officer may grant an extension of time of not more than
120 days for the owner to complete all work, during which time no
§ 228-5 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 228-6
225:482
§ 228-7. Property deemed not abandoned; criteria; certification of
abandonment.
further proceedings will be taken against the owner or the
property.
B. If the owner has posted cash or a bond in order to have a property
removed from the abandoned property list and the conditions because
of which the property was determined to be abandoned have not been
fully remediated within one year of the date of posting the cash or bond,
or, in the case of a property which requires a remediation of any known,
suspected or threatened release of contaminants, if the owner has
failed to enter into a memorandum of agreement with the Department
of Environmental Protection or an administrative consent order, as the
case may be, or if an agreement or order is in effect but the owner has
failed to perform the remediation in conformance with the agreement
or order, then the cash or bond shall be forfeited to the Borough which
shall use the cash or bond and any interest which has accrued thereon
for the purpose of demolishing or rehabilitating the property or
performing the environmental remediation. Any funds remaining after
the property has been demolished, rehabilitated or cleaned up shall be
returned to the owner.
A. An abandoned property shall not be included on the abandoned
property list if rehabilitation is being performed in a timely manner, as
evidenced by building permits issued and the furtherance of
rehabilitation work as authorized by said permits.
B. If an entity or person other than the Borough has purchased or taken
assignment for the Borough of a tax sale certificate on a property that
has not been legally occupied for a period of six months, that property
shall not be placed on the abandoned property list if:
(1) The owner of the certificate has continued to pay all Borough taxes
and liens on the property in the tax year when due; and
(2) The owner of the certificate takes action to initiate a foreclosure
proceeding within six months after the property is eligible for
foreclosure pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, and diligently pursues
foreclosure proceedings in a timely fashion thereafter.
C. A property which is used on a seasonal basis shall be deemed to be
abandoned only if the property meets any two of the additional criteria
set forth under N.J.S.A. 55:19-81.
D. Upon request of a purchaser or assignee of a tax sale certificate seeking
to bar the right of redemption on an abandoned property pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, the public officer or the Borough Tax Collector shall, in
a timely fashion, provide the requester with a Certification of
Abandonment that the property satisfies the definition of an abandoned
property in accordance with this chapter.
§ 228-6 PRECIOUS METALS AND GEMS § 228-8
225:483
§ 228-8. Acquisition of tax sale certificate; action to foreclose right
of redemption.
§ 228-9. Special tax sale; criteria for bidders.
A. When a person other than the Borough acquires a tax sale certificate
for a property on the abandoned property list at tax sale, the purchaser
may institute an action to foreclose the right of redemption at any time
after the expiration of six months following the date of the sale of the
tax sale certificate.
B. When the Borough is the purchaser at tax sale of any property on the
abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34, an action to
foreclose the right of redemption may be instituted in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection b. of N.J.S.A. 54:5-77. After the foreclosure
action is instituted, the right to redeem shall exist and continue to exist
until barred by the judgment of the Superior Court; provided, however,
that no redemption shall be permitted except where the owner:
(1) Posts cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating the conditions
because of which the property was determined to be abandoned
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-56, as determined by the court; or
(2) Demonstrates to the court that the conditions because of which the
property was determined to be abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A.
55:19-56 have been remedied in full.
A. The Borough may hold special tax sales with respect to those properties
eligible for tax sale pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 which are also on the
abandoned property list.
B. The Commissioners shall establish criteria for eligibility to bid on
properties at the sale, which may include, but need not be limited to:
(1) Documentation of the bidder's ability to rehabilitate or otherwise
reuse the property consistent with Borough plans and regulations;
commitments by the bidder to rehabilitate or otherwise reuse the
property, consistent with Borough plans and regulations;
(2) Commitments by the bidder to take action to foreclose on the tax
lien by a date certain; and
(3) Such other criteria as the Commissioners may determine are
necessary to ensure that the properties to be sold will be
rehabilitated or otherwise reused in a manner consistent with the
public interest.
C. The Commissioners may establish minimum bid requirements for a
special tax sale that are less than the full amount of the taxes, interest
and penalties due to help ensure that the properties will be
rehabilitated or otherwise utilized in a manner consistent with the
public interest.
§ 228-8 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 228-9
225:484
§ 228-10. Expedited action to foreclose right of redemption.
D. The Commissioners may combine properties in said special tax sale into
bid packages and require that bidders place a single bid on each
package, rejecting any and all bids on individual properties that are
submitted.
E. The Commissioners may sell said properties subject to the provision
that, if the purchaser fails to carry out any commitment that has been
set forth as a condition of sale or misrepresents any material
qualification that has been established as a condition of eligibility to bid
pursuant thereto, then the properties and any interest thereto acquired
by the purchaser shall revert to the Borough, and any amount paid by
the purchaser at the special tax sale shall be forfeit to the Borough.
F. In the event there are two or more qualified bidders for any property or
bid package in a special tax sale, the Borough may designate the
unsuccessful qualified bidder whose bid was closest to the successful
bid, as an eligible purchaser. In the event that the selected purchaser of
that property or bid package fails to meet any of the conditions of sale
established by the Borough pursuant to this section and their interest in
the property or properties reverts to the Borough, the Borough may
subsequently designate the entity previously designated as an eligible
purchaser as the winning bidder for the property or properties, and
assign the tax sale certificates to that entity on the basis of that entity's
bid at the special tax sale, subject to the terms and conditions of the
special tax sale.
G. The Borough shall provide notice of a special tax sale pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 54:5-26. The notice shall include any special terms of sale
established by the Borough pursuant to this section. Nothing shall
prohibit the Borough from holding a special tax sale on the same day as
a standard or accelerated tax sale.
A. When a person or entity other than the Borough acquires a tax sale
certificate for a property on the abandoned property list at tax sale, the
purchaser may institute an action to foreclose the right of redemption
at any time after the expiration of just six months following the date of
the sale of the tax sale certificate.
B. When the Borough is the purchaser at tax sale of any property on the
abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34, an action to
foreclose the right of redemption may be instituted in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection b. of N.J.S.A. 54:5-77.
(1) After the foreclosure action is instituted, the right to redeem shall
exist and continue to exist until barred by the judgment of the
Superior Court; provided, however, that no redemption shall be
permitted except where the owner:
§ 228-9 PRECIOUS METALS AND GEMS § 228-10
225:485
§ 228-11. Transfer of possession and control to Borough.
(a) Posts cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating the
conditions because of which the property was determined to be
abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-56, as determined by the
Court; or
(b) Demonstrates to the Court that the conditions because of
which the property was determined to be abandoned have
been remedied in full.
A. Transfer of possession.
(1) A summary action or otherwise to transfer possession and control
of abandoned property in need of rehabilitation to the Borough may
be brought by the Borough in the Superior Court, County of
Camden. If the court shall find that the property is abandoned
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-81, and the owner or party in interest
has failed to submit and initiate a rehabilitation plan, then the court
may authorize the Borough to take possession and control of the
property and develop a rehabilitation plan.
(2) If the Borough is granted possession, it may commence and
maintain those further proceedings for the conservation, protection
or disposal of the property or any part thereof that are required to
rehabilitate the property, necessary to recoup the cost and
expenses of rehabilitation and for the sale of the property;
provided, however, that the court shall not direct the sale of the
property if the owner applies to the court for reinstatement of
control of the property as provided in N.J.S.A. 55:19-92.
(3) Failure by the owner, mortgage holder or lien holder to submit
plans for rehabilitation to the municipality, obtain appropriate
construction permits for rehabilitation or, in the alternative, submit
formal applications for funding the cost of rehabilitation to local,
state or federal agencies providing such funding within that sixmonth
period shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the owner
has failed to take any action to further the rehabilitation of the
property.
B. A complaint filed pursuant to section N.J.S.A. 55:19-84 and Subsection
A of this section shall include:
(1) Documentation that the property is on the municipal abandoned
property list or a certification by the public officer that the property
is abandoned; and
(2) A statement by an individual holding appropriate professional
qualifications that there are sound reasons that the building should
be rehabilitated rather than demolished based upon the physical,
aesthetic or historical character of the building or the relationship
§ 228-10 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 228-11
225:486
of the building to other buildings and lands within its immediate
vicinity.
C. Within 10 days of filing a complaint, the plaintiff shall file a notice of lis
pendens with the County of Camden recording officer.
(1) At least 30 days before filing the Complaint, the Borough shall
serve a notice of intention to take possession of an abandoned
building. The notice shall inform the owner and interested parties
that the property has not been legally occupied for six months and
of those criteria that led to a determination of abandonment
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-81.
(2) The notice shall provide that unless the owner or a party in interest
prepares and submits a rehabilitation plan to the appropriate
Borough officials, the Borough will seek to gain possession of the
building to rehabilitate the property and the associated cost shall
be a lien against the property, which may be satisfied by the sale of
the property, unless the owner applies to the court for
reinstatement of control of the property as provided in N.J.S.A.
55:19-92.
(3) After the complaint is filed, the complaint shall be served on the
parties in interest in accordance with the New Jersey Rules of
Court.
(4) After serving the notice of intention pursuant to this subsection, the
Borough may enter upon that property after written notice to the
owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, in order to
secure, stabilize or repair the property, or in order to inspect the
property for purposes of preparing the plan to be submitted to the
court pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-89.
D. Any owner may defend against a complaint filed pursuant to this section
by submitting a plan for the rehabilitation and reuse of the property
which is the subject of the complaint and by posting a bond equal to
125% of the amount determined by the public officer or the court to be
the projected cost of rehabilitation.
(1) Any plan submitted by an owner to defend against a complaint shall
be submitted within 60 days after the complaint has been filed,
unless the court provides the owner with an extension of time for
good cause shown.
(2) A plan submitted by an owner pursuant to this subsection shall
include, but not be limited to:
(a) A detailed financial feasibility analysis, including
documentation of the economic feasibility of the proposed
reuse, including operating budgets or resale prices, or both, as
appropriate;
§ 228-11 PRECIOUS METALS AND GEMS § 228-11
225:487
(b) A budget for the rehabilitation of the property, including
sources and uses of funds, based on the terms and conditions
of realistically available financing, including grants and loans;
(c) A timetable for the completion of rehabilitation and reuse of
the property, including milestones for performance of major
steps leading to and encompassing the rehabilitation and reuse
of the property; and
(d) Documentation of the qualifications of the individuals and
firms that will be engaged to carry out the planning, design,
financial packaging, construction, and marketing or rental of
the property.
E. The court shall approve any plan that, in the judgment of the court, is
realistic and likely to result in the expeditious rehabilitation and reuse
of the property, which is the subject of the complaint.
(1) If the court approves the owner's plan, then it may appoint the
public officer to act as monitor of the owner's compliance. If the
owner fails to carry out any step in the approved plan, then the
Borough may apply to the court to have the owner's bond forfeited,
possession of the building transferred to the Borough to complete
the rehabilitation plan and authorization to use the bond proceeds
for rehabilitation of the property.
(2) The owner shall provide quarterly reports to the Borough on its
activities and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the
property. The owner shall provide those reports to the court on its
activities that the court determines are necessary.
(3) The court may reject a plan and bond if it finds that the plan does
not represent a realistic and expeditious means of ensuring the
rehabilitation of the property or that the owner or his
representatives or agents, or both, lack the qualifications,
background or other criteria necessary to ensure that the plan will
be carried out successfully.
F. If an owner is unsuccessful in defending against a complaint filed
pursuant to this section, the mortgage holder or lien holder may seek to
be designated in possession of the property by submitting a plan and
posting a bond meeting the same conditions as set forth in N.J.S.A.
55:19-87. The plan shall be submitted within 60 days after the court has
rejected the owner's plan, unless the court provides the mortgage
holder or lienholder with an extension of time for good cause shown. If
the court approves any such mortgage holder or lien holder's plan, it
shall designate that party to be in possession of the property for
purposes of ensuring its rehabilitation and reuse and may appoint the
public officer to act as monitor of the party's compliance. The mortgage
holder or lien holder, as the case may be, shall provide quarterly reports
to the court and the Borough on its activities and progress toward
rehabilitation and reuse of the property.
§ 228-11 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 228-11
225:488
§ 228-12. Borough rehabilitation of property; submission of plan to
court.
§ 228-13. Borough exercise of rights to further rehabilitation and
reuse of property; designation of qualified rehabilitation entity.
G. If the mortgage holder or lien holder fails to carry out any material step
in the approved plan, then the public officer shall notify the court,
which may order the bond forfeit, grant the Borough possession of the
property, and authorize the Borough to use the proceeds of the bond for
rehabilitation of the property. Any sums incurred or advanced for the
purpose of rehabilitating the property by a mortgage holder or lien
holder granted possession of a property pursuant to this section,
including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, may be added to
the unpaid balance due that mortgage holder or lien holder, with
interest calculated at the same rate set forth in the note or security
agreement; or, in the case of a tax lien holder, at the statutory interest
rate for subsequent liens.
A. If no mortgage holder or lienholder meets the conditions of N.J.S.A.
55:19-88, then the Borough shall submit a plan to the court which
conforms with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-87.
B. The court shall grant the Borough possession of the property if it finds
that:
(1) The proposed rehabilitation and reuse of the property is
appropriate and beneficial;
(2) The Borough is qualified to undertake the rehabilitation and reuse
of the property; and
(3) The plan submitted by the Borough represents a realistic and
timely plan for the rehabilitation and reuse of the property.
C. The Borough shall take all steps necessary and appropriate to further
the rehabilitation and reuse of the property consistent with the plan
submitted to the court. In making its findings pursuant to this section,
the court may consult with qualified parties, including the Department
of Community Affairs, and, upon request by a party in interest, may hold
a hearing on the plan.
A. The Borough may exercise its rights under N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et al.
directly, or may designate a qualified rehabilitation entity to ACT as its
designee for the purpose of exercising the Borough's rights where that
designation will further the rehabilitation and reuse of the property
consistent with Borough's plans and objectives. This designation shall
be made by resolution of the Commissioners.
B. Regardless of whether the Borough exercises its rights directly or
designates a qualified rehabilitation entity pursuant to this section,
while in possession of a property, the Borough shall maintain,

safeguard, and maintain insurance on the property. Notwithstanding
the Borough's possession of the property, nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to relieve the owner of the property of any civil or criminal
liability or any duty imposed by reason of acts or omissions of the
owner.
C. If the Borough has been granted possession of a property, the Borough
shall be deemed to have an ownership interest in the property for the
purpose of filing plans with public agencies and boards, seeking and
obtaining construction permits and other approvals, and submitting
applications for financing or other assistance to public or private
entities.
D. For the purposes of any state program of grants or loans, including but
not limited to programs of the Department of Community Affairs and
the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, possession of a
property under this section shall be considered legal control of the
property.
E. The court may approve the borrowing of funds by the Borough to
rehabilitate the property and may grant a lien or security interests with
priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal liens. For
the purposes of this section, the cost of rehabilitation shall include
reasonable non-construction costs such as architectural fees or
construction permit fees customarily included in the financing of the
rehabilitation of residential property.
F. The Borough shall file a notice of completion with the court, and shall
also serve a copy on the owner and any mortgage holder or lien holder,
at such time as the Borough has determined that no more than six
months remain to the anticipated date on which rehabilitation will be
complete. This notice shall include an affidavit of the public officer
attesting that rehabilitation can realistically be anticipated to be
complete within that time period, and a statement setting forth such
actions as it plans to undertake to ensure that reuse of the property
takes place consistent with the plan.
G. Notwithstanding the granting of possession to the Borough, nothing in
this chapter shall be deemed to relieve the owner of the property of any
obligation the owner or any other person may have for the payment of
taxes or other Borough liens and charges, or mortgages or liens to any
party, whether those taxes, charges or liens are incurred before or after
the granting of possession. The granting of possession shall not
suspend any obligation the owner may have as of the date of the
granting of possession for payment of any operating or maintenance
expense associated with the property, whether or not billed at the time
of the granting of possession.
§ 228-13 COLLINGSWOOD CODE § 228-14
225:490
§ 228-15. Obligations of owner prior to grant of petition.
A. An owner may petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and
possession of the property at any time after one year from the grant of
possession, but no later than 30 days after the Borough has filed a
Notice of Completion with the court or, in the event the Notice of
Completion is filed within less than one year of the grant of possession,
within 30 days after the Borough has filed notice. The court may allow
additional time for good cause if that additional time does not
materially delay completion of the rehabilitation, place undue hardship
on the Borough, or affect any of the terms or conditions under which the
Borough has applied for or received financing for the rehabilitation of
the property.
B. Any petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and possession of
the property shall:
(1) Include a plan for completion of the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property consistent with the plan previously approved by the court;
(2) Provide legally binding assurances that the owner will comply with
all conditions of any grant or loan secured by the Borough or repay
those grants or loans in full, at the discretion of the maker of the
loan or grant; and
(3) Be accompanied by payment equal to the sum of 1) all Borough
liens outstanding on the property; 2) all costs incurred by the
Borough in bringing action with respect to the property; 3) any
costs incurred by the Borough not covered by grants or loans to be
assumed or repaid pursuant to this section; and 4) any costs
remaining to complete rehabilitation and reuse of the property, as
determined by the public officer, which payment shall be placed in
escrow with the Clerk of the Court, County of Camden, pending
disposition of the petition.
A. Prior to the granting of a petition on the part of the owner by the court
pursuant to § 228-14, the owner may be required to post a bond or
other security in an amount determined by the court, after consultation
with the public officer, as likely to ensure that the owner will continue
to maintain the property in sound condition. That bond or other security
shall be made available to the Borough to make any repair on the
property in the event of a code violation which is not corrected in timely
fashion by the owner.
B. The owner may seek approval of the court to be relieved of this
requirement after five years, which shall be granted if the court finds
that the owner has maintained the property in good repair during that
period, that no material violations affecting the health and safety of the
tenants have occurred during that period, and that the owner has
remedied other violations in a timely and expeditious fashion.

possession of the property within 30 days after the Borough has filed a
notice of completion or in any event within two years after the initial
grant of possession, or if the owner fails to meet any conditions that
may be set by the court in granting a reinstatement petition, upon
petition from the Borough, the court may grant the Borough title or
authorize the Borough to sell the property, subject to the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 55:19-96.
B. Where the Borough seeks to gain title to the property, it shall purchase
the property for fair market value on such terms as the court shall
approve, and may place the proceeds of the sale in escrow with the
court.
C. The court may authorize the Borough to sell the building free and clear
of liens, claims and encumbrances, in which event all such liens, claims
and encumbrances shall be transferred to the proceeds of sale with the
same priority as existed prior to resale in accordance with the
provisions of this section, except that municipal liens shall be paid at
settlement. The proceeds of the purchase of the property shall be
distributed as set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97.
D. The Borough may seek approval of the court to sell the property to a
third party when the court finds that such conveyance will further the
effective and timely rehabilitation and reuse of the property.
E. Upon approval by the court, the Borough shall sell the property on such
terms and at such price as the court shall approve, and may place the
proceeds of sale in escrow with the court. The court shall order a
distribution of the proceeds of sale after paying court costs in the order
of priority set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97. The proceeds paid pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 55:19-96 shall be distributed in the following order of priority:

indebtedness incurred by the Borough and granted priority lien
status pursuant to Subsection a. of N.J.S.A. 55:19-98;

A. With respect to any eminent domain proceeding carried out under
section N.J.S.A. 55:19-56, the fair market value of the property shall be
established on the basis of an analysis which determines independently:
(1) The cost to rehabilitate and reuse the property for such purpose as
is appropriate under existing planning and zoning regulations
governing its reuse or to demolish the existing property and
construct a new building on the site, including all costs ancillary to
rehabilitation such as, but not limited to, marketing and legal costs;
(2) The realistic market value of the reused property after
rehabilitation or new construction, taking into account the market
conditions particular to the neighborhood or subarea of the
Borough in which the property is located; and
(3) The extent to which the cost exceeds or does not exceed the market
value after rehabilitation, or demolition and new construction, and
the extent to which any "as is" value of the property prior to
rehabilitation can be added to the cost of rehabilitation or
demolition and new construction without the resulting combined
cost exceeding the market value as separately determined.
B. If the appraisal finds that the cost of rehabilitation or demolition and
new construction, as appropriate, exceeds the realistic market value
after rehabilitation or demolition and new construction, there shall be a
rebuttable presumption in all proceedings under this subsection that
the fair market value of the abandoned property is zero, and that no
compensation is due the owner.

therefor has been served upon the licensee, either personally or by

A. The Borough Commission determines to provide for the exemption from
taxation of improvements to residential owner-occupied, single-family
dwellings and the owner-occupied residential portion of mixed-use
dwellings more than 20 years old. In determining the value of real
property, the Borough shall regard the first $25,000 in the Assessor's
full and true value of improvements for each dwelling unit primarily and
directly affected by the improvements as not increasing the value of the
property for a period of five years, notwithstanding that the value of the
property to which the improvements are made is increased thereby.
During the exemption period, the assessment on the property shall not

improvements, except if an additional abatement is granted for the
property pursuant to Subsection B of this section, or there is damage to
the dwelling through action of the elements sufficient to warrant a

period, the assessment on the property shall not be less than the
assessment thereon existing immediately prior to the improvement
unless there is damage to the structure through action of the elements
sufficient to warrant a reduction. [Amended 2-1-1999 by Ord. No.
1178; 4-2-2001 by Ord. No. 1251]

a percentage of taxes otherwise due according to any one basis of the

property owner ceases to operate or disposes of the property, or fails to
meet the conditions for qualifying for the abatement, the local property
taxes due for all the prior years subject to abatement and for the current
year shall be payable as if no exemption or abatement had been granted.

pay to the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount
annually equal to 15% of the annual gross revenues from the project.
For the purposes of the agreement, "annual gross revenues" means the
total annual gross rental and other income payable to the owner of the
project from the project. If, in any leasing, any real estate taxes or
assessments on property included in the project, any premiums for fire
or other insurance on or concerning property included in the project, or
any operating or maintenance expenses ordinarily paid by the landlord
are to be paid by the tenant, then those payments shall be computed
and deemed to be part of the rent and shall be included in the annual
gross revenue. The tax agreement shall establish the method of
computing the revenues and may establish a method of arbitration by
which either the landlord or tenant may dispute the amount of
payments so included in the annual gross revenue.

273:600
The Tax Collector of the Borough of Collingswood shall notify the property
owner within 15 days of the date of disqualification of the amount of taxes
due. In the event that the subject property has been transferred to a new
owner, and it is determined that the new owner will continue to use the
property pursuant to the qualifying conditions, no tax shall be due, the
exemption and abatement shall continue and the agreement shall remain in
effect.
§ 273-6.6. Additional exemption or abatement.
The Borough of Collingswood hereby determines that an additional
improvement, conversion or construction completed on a property already
granted a previous exemption or abatement pursuant to this article during
the period in which the previous exemption or abatement is in effect shall
qualify for an additional exemption or abatement. The additional
improvement, conversion or construction shall be considered as separate
for purposes of calculating the exemption and abatement, except that the
assessed value of any previous improvement, conversion or construction
shall be added to the assessed valuation as it was prior to that improvement,
conversion or construction for the purpose of determining the assessed
value of the property for which any additional abatement is to be
subtracted.
§ 273-6.7. Delinquent taxes.
No exemption or abatement shall be granted or tax agreement entered
into pursuant to this article for any property for which property taxes are
delinquent or remain unpaid, or for which penalties for nonpayment of taxes
are due. As a condition to granting an exemption or abatement, a property
owner shall be required to waive the filing of any tax appeal for the subject
property for the life of the exemption/abatement.

At the termination of an agreement for tax abatement or exemption
authorized pursuant to this article, the project shall be subject to all
applicable real property taxes, as provided by state laws and regulations
and local ordinances, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to
prohibit the project or improvement at the termination of the agreement
for tax abatement from qualifying for and receiving the full benefits of any
other tax preference provided by law.

respectively ascribed to them in this section for purposes of this article:
PARKING METER  Any mechanical device or meter not inconsistent with
this article placed or erected for the regulation of parking by authority of
this article. Each parking meter installed shall indicate by proper legend the
legal parking time established by the Chief of Police and, when operated,
shall at all times indicate the balance of legal parking time and, at the
expiration of such period, shall indicate illegal or overtime parking.
PARKING METER SPACE  Any space within a parking meter zone, which
is adjacent to a parking meter and which is duly designated for the parking
of a single vehicle by lines painted or otherwise durably marked on the curb
or on the surface of the street or lot adjacent to or adjoining the parking
meters.
PARKING METER ZONE  Any restricted on-street parking area or offstreet
parking lot upon which parking meters are installed and in operation.
§ 293-33. Designation of parking spaces.
The Chief of Police is hereby directed and authorized to provide for the
marking off of individual parking spaces in the parking meter zones
designated and described in Schedule XXII (§ 293-71), said parking spaces
to be designated by lines painted or marked on the curbing or surface of the

vehicle in such a way that said vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits
of the space so designated.
§ 293-34. Installation of parking meters.
In said parking meter zones, the Chief of Police shall cause parking meters
to be installed upon the curb, sidewalk or area immediately adjacent to
the parking spaces provided in § 293-33 of this article. No parking meters
shall be installed in areas where parking is prohibited pursuant to the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 39:4-138. The Chief of Police shall be responsible for

meters. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal
parking upon the deposit of the appropriate coin, lawful money of the
United States of America, for the period of time prescribed in § 293-35.
Each device shall be so arranged that upon the expiration of the lawful time
limit, it will indicate by a proper, visible signal that the lawful parking period
has expired, and in such case the right of such vehicle to occupy such space
shall cease, and the operator, owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be
subject to the penalties hereinafter provided.
§ 293-32 VEHICLE SALES LOTS § 293-35
289:641
§ 293-35. Operation of parking meters.
Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Fire or
Police Department, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer
or traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any
parking space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the
operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering the said parking meter space,
immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper
coin of the United States of America as is required for such parking meter
and as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required
by the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the
deposit of the proper coin, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism
on such meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon,
and failure to deposit such proper coin and to set the timing mechanism
in operation when so required shall constitute a violation of this article.
Upon the deposit of such coin (and the setting of the timing mechanism in
operation when so required), the parking space may be lawfully occupied
by such vehicle during the period of time which has been prescribed for
the part of the street in which said parking space is located, provided that
any person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space adjacent to a meter
which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the previous
occupant of the space shall not be required to deposit a coin so long as his
occupancy of said space does not exceed the indicated unused parking time.
If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the
parking time limit set for such parking space and if the meter shall indicate
such illegal parking, then and in that event such vehicle shall be considered
as parking overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such
parking shall be deemed a violation of this article.

When a parking meter space is parallel with the adjacent curb or sidewalk,
no person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking
space in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle
nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter space is diagonal to
the curb or sidewalk, no person shall park or permit the parking of any
vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost
part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter
shall have been installed at the head of and immediately adjacent to any
parking space on a municipal off-street parking lot, no person shall park or
permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space in any other position
than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter;
provided, however, that in municipal off-street parking lots, signs shall be
erected indicating that "head-on" parking only is permitted. In any event, a
vehicle shall be parked within the lines marked on the pavement measuring
