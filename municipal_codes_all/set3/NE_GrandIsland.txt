Purpose. Whereas, there may arise a design or material that may not meet the exact criteria of the Building Code, especially in the areas of Energy Related projects, this Board shall examine the data available, and/or may require any additional data, to determine that the proposed material or method is at least equivalent of the purpose as set forth in the Building Codes.

  (1) If an applicant shall be denied a building permit or shall receive disapproval from the chief building official, the applicant may file a request on the forms furnished by the Building Department, together with a request procedure fee in accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule, stating in full detail what the product or project is, the use, sections of the Code that cannot be fully complied with, what the alternative material or method will be, and sufficient evidence supporting the request. This shall be filed with the chief building official who shall then notify the officers of the Board, who shall set a time of meeting, and the meeting shall be within ten (10) days of the date of application.

  (2) The meeting of the Building Code Advisory Board shall be presided over by the chairman.

  (3) The Board shall hear all evidence by the party requesting consideration and a presentation by the chief building official.

  (4) After hearing all evidence presented, the Board shall determine whether the proposed alternate method of material is equivalent with the interest and safety of the Code, or may recommend changes to their satisfaction.

               This section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection.

               Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or otherwise available on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the building official.

               To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefore in writing on a form furnished for that purpose and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule.

               In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

§9-6.  Statement of Intent
                (A) The Council recognizes the United States Congress' intent in approving the CCPA (expressed in Section 601 -- codified at 47 USC 521). As such, the Council reaffirms and adopts those principles and ideals as part of the City's intent with respect to cable television and expands its intent to cover all MCS providers.

                (B) As expressed by Congress, and adopted by the Council, its intent is as follows:

   (1) establish a local policy concerning communications and technologies;

   (2) establish franchise procedures and standards which encourage the growth and development of cable systems which assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and interests of the City;

   (3) establish guidelines for the exercise of local authority with respect to the regulation of cable systems;

   (4) assure that cable communications provide, and are encouraged to provide, the widest diversity of information and services to the public;

   (5) establish an orderly process for franchise renewal which protects cable operators against unfair denials of renewal where an operator's past performance and proposal for future performance meet the standards set by the CCPA, and this ordinance; and

   (6) promote competition in cable communications and minimize unnecessary regulation that would impose an undue economic burden on cable systems.

                (C) In addition to principles and ideals listed in subsection (2), the Council also expresses that its intent covers the following:

   (1) to create a set of regulations, standards, and procedures for MCS providers;

   (2) to create a comprehensive customer service and consumer protection policy for MCS providers;

   (3) to provide for access and inspection of an MCS provider's books and records in order to monitor compliance of local, State, and Federal laws, and any franchise agreement (if one has been granted);

   (4) to create a thorough construction and installation policy for an MCS provider's system;

   (5) to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City in light of the MCS provider's construction, operation, and maintenance;

   (6) to provide for emergency override capability, so that citizens of the City may be warned of a potential, imminent, actual disaster or emergency situation that exists in the area;

   (7) to provide for the introduction and installation of an in-home signal or safety alert technology in order to notify both subscribers and non-subscribers to an MCS provider's service of imminent disaster emergencies;

   (8) to create a thorough procedure for collecting and monitoring franchise fees and alternative user charges;

   (9) to create a viable alternative to franchise fees in case such fees, or their collection, or method of computation are ruled invalid, unenforceable, or unconstitutional;

   (10) to create a thorough default and revocation procedure for licensed and franchised MCS providers;

   (11) to provide for continuity of services in the event of City acquisition, abandonment, withdrawal, cessation of service, revocation, termination, non-renewal, or expiration of an MCS provider; and

   (12) creating a performance review procedure in order to assist the City in its periodic evaluation of a franchised MCS provider's performance.

 

§9-7.  Administration; Delegation of Powers and Authority
                (A) The Council/franchising authority is hereby designated the officer of the City which is responsible for the continuing administration of this ordinance.

                (B) Unless prohibited by federal or State law, the Council/franchising authority may delegate its powers and authorities with respect to an MCS provider to a duly authorized representative of the City, including the Mayor, the City Manager, a City Cable Advisory Committee, or an outside consultant.

§9-8.  Applicability of this Ordinance to an MCS Provider
                Unless exempted entirely from this ordinance, or exempted under one (1) or more provisions of this ordinance, or granted relief (by the Council/franchising authority) from one (1) or more provisions and/or requirements of this ordinance, then this ordinance shall be applicable to an MCS provider, and this ordinance shall have full effect and be enforceable in its entirety. Moreover, a non-exempt MCS provider shall be expected to comply with this ordinance no later than six (6) months after this ordinance becomes effective, except where a different compliance date is given or noted.

 

§9-9.  Exemption from this Ordinance for Certain MCS Providers
                (A) Recognizing the inherent technological differences between various types of MCS providers, and taking into account a number of financial, operational, and maintenance considerations, the Council/franchising authority exempts certain MCS providers from complying with the provisions contained in this ordinance.

                (B) MCS providers who are exempted from complying with the provisions of this ordinance are as follows:

   (1) an MCS provider who is exempted from this ordinance as a result of an applicable FCC ruling; or

   (2) an MCS provider who is exempted from this ordinance as a result of an applicable judicial ruling.

                (C) It is expressly understood that an exempted MCS provider remains exempted only as long as it meets one (1) or more of the specifications of this particular section.

                (D) It also is expressly noted that the extent of the exemption for a qualified MCS provider is only for this ordinance. Consequently, such an exempted MCS provider is expected to abide by, and comply with, any other applicable City, State, or Federal laws and regulations, including any applicable federal, or State consumer protection, or customer service laws and regulations.

 

§9-10.  Non-Exempt MCS Providers Seeking Relief from this Ordinance
                (A) Any MCS provider affected by this ordinance may file a written petition, at any time, with the Council/franchising authority seeking relief from one (1) or more provisions of this ordinance. The relief requested may specifically include the delay in implementation (as to the petitioning MCS provider only) of one (1) or more provisions of this ordinance.

                (B) In order to receive any relief from one (1) or more of the provisions of this ordinance, a non-exempt MCS provider must satisfactorily demonstrate to the Council/franchising authority that at least one (1) of the following facts exist:

   (1) the provision and/or requirement is expressly prohibited by Federal law, the FCC, or State law; or

   (2) where applicable, that the provision in question materially affects, and is in conflict with an expressed right that is specifically noted in an existing franchise agreement (but only for the term of the existing franchise); or

   (3) that the imposition of such provisions and/or requirements will create such an undue economic hardship on an MCS provider so as to imperil or eliminate an MCS provider's ability to provide multi-channel service to a majority of current subscribers; or

   (4) that the MCS provider has its own construction, maintenance, operation, or customer service policy, which the Council/franchising authority deems comparable to, or exceeding, any provision and/or requirement from which the MCS provider seeks relief.

                (C) Unless delegated to another authorized representative of the City, the Council/franchising authority shall have the responsibility of determining whether an MCS provider's construction, maintenance, operation, or customer service policy, is comparable to, or exceeds, a similar provision in this ordinance.

                (D) As an alternative to seeking an exemption, or requesting relief, an MCS provider may petition for clarification on the precise intent and effect that one (1) or more provisions or sections of this ordinance has on the petitioning MCS provider.

                (E) In accordance with this ordinance, the Council/franchising authority may charge the petitioning MCS provider with the actual costs for processing such a petition, including any costs incurred by outside consultants who are retained by the City to review an MCS provider's petition.

                (F) In those instances where the Council/franchising authority grants an exemption, or relief, or clarification, to a franchised MCS provider, or deems a franchised MCS provider's operational policy to be comparable to an ordinance provision, then the franchise agreement (initial, existing, or renewal) shall be amended within thirty (30) days to reflect the exact extent of such exemption and/or relief. It should be specifically noted that the benefit of such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy extends only to the MCS provider granted such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy.

 

§9-11.  Failure of the Council/Franchising Authority to Enforce this Ordinance
                A non-exempt MCS provider shall not be excused from complying with any of the requirements of this ordinance, or any subsequently adopted amendments to this ordinance, by any failure of the Council/franchising authority on any one (1) or more occasions to seek, or insist upon compliance with such requirements or provisions.

 

§9-12.  MCS Providers or their Assignees Subject to Present and Future Ordinances
                (A) Any non-exempt MCS provider, its assignee, or transferee shall be subject to, and expected to comply with, all ordinances now or hereafter adopted and in effect within the City, including this ordinance, to the extent that said MCS provider has not received an exemption or relief from said ordinance(s).

                (B) Any non-exempt MCS provider, its assignee, or transferee shall be subject to, and expected to comply with, all Federal and State Laws, and with all rules issued by all applicable regulatory agencies now or hereafter in existence.

§9-13.  Repeal of Prior Inconsistent Resolutions and Ordinances
                To the extent that there is any prior resolution or ordinance which in part, or in whole, is directly inconsistent with this ordinance, then such part, or such whole, of the prior resolution or ordinance shall be repealed to the extent of the inconsistency.

                (A) In any case of an actual inconsistency between any provision or section of this ordinance, and any provision or section of a Federal or State rule, regulation, or law, then the Federal or State rule, regulation, or law shall not only supersede the effect of the ordinance, but also control in any local application.

                (B) The above subsection specifically includes any situation wherein an applicable Federal or State judicial decision creates an actual inconsistency with any provision or section of this ordinance. In such a situation, the Federal or State judicial decision shall not only supersede the effect of the ordinance, but also control in any local application.

 

§9-15.  Resolution of Conflicts Between this Ordinance and an Existing Franchise Agreement

                (B) In the case where a franchised MCS provider receives an exemption, relief, or clarification from one (1) or more provisions or Sections of this ordinance, or has one (1) or more of its policies deemed comparable to a provision contained in this ordinance, then the franchise should specifically note such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy, and to the extent that such an exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy, is inconsistent with a provision contained in this ordinance, then the specifically noted exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy language contained in the franchise agreement controls.

 

§9-16.  Arbitration
                If the Council/franchising authority and a franchised MCS provider agree to such, and the federal or State law does not expressly prohibit such, then arbitration or settlement mediation may be used to resolve any dispute that arises out of this ordinance or franchise agreement. The terms and conditions relating to the arbitration or settlement mediation process (including possible cap on costs expended by both parties, composition of the hearing panel, and liability, if any for costs expended) shall be stated with specificity in the franchise agreement.

The purpose of the performance bond is to ensure performance of any requirements imposed by this ordinance on an MCS provider. Further, the purpose is to guarantee that should the MCS provider not fulfill any obligations imposed by this ordinance (or where applicable a franchise agreement), then the surety will make whole (to the extent of the policy) any monetary losses incurred by the City.

                (B) An MCS provider shall furnish to the Council/franchising authority, a construction/completion bond prior to the time it commences a construction, upgrade, rebuild, or repair/maintenance project that has a capital construction cost or outlay exceeding fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in value.

The construction/completion bond shall remain in force at all times, unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in an agreement between the Council/franchising authority, and the MCS provider.

                (C) The construction/completion bond or security bond shall specifically guarantee that an MCS provider will timely abide by its construction, upgrade, rebuild, or repair/maintenance schedule for the multi-channel system and/or any timetable for technical and service improvements or additions to the multi-channel system as may be committed to, or agreed upon, from time to time by the Council/franchising authority and MCS provider.

                (D) If the City draws on a performance or completion bond, or cash deposit, or letter of credit as a result of an MCS provider's failure to timely discharge its obligations, or failure to construct and activate the multi-channel system, or failure to complete a multi-channel system upgrade or rebuild or repair/maintenance, then the MCS provider shall be required, within thirty (30) days to replenish the completion and performance bond or security bond to the minimal level required by the Council/franchising authority.

                (E) Based upon such reasons as the Council/franchising authority might feel are necessary to protect the public interest, and welfare, the Council/franchising authority may raise the minimal amount of the performance bond.

                (F) The performance bond or security bond, shall be in force at all times unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in an agreement, between the MCS provider and the Council/franchising authority.

                (G) In lieu of a performance bond, and construction/completion bond, the Council/franchising authority may accept a written guarantee of an MCS provider pledging the full faith and credit of the affected MCS provider should there be a breach in a material franchise term, or failure to meet any construction schedule.

                (B) Consequently, it is incumbent that the Council/franchising authority take measures to reduce the risk that multi-channel service or the multi-channel system will be adversely affected in any given year.

                (C) Therefore, the evaluation of legal, technical, financial, and character qualifications of an MCS provider is viewed as a constant undertaking on the part of the City. As a result, the Council/franchising authority requires that the operator maintain and retain all records and reports necessary for a City/franchising authority to determine compliance with the obligations imposed on an MCS provider, and to determine the MCS provider's (legal, technical, financial, and character) qualifications. The information is primarily intended to assist the MCS provider to maximize service, rather than to identify incidents of non-compliance.

 

§9-30.  Furnishing of Reports
                (A) At any time the FCC or another Federal or State agency requires or requests the submission of reports, data, or other information by a non-exempt multi-channel service provider, then such MCS provider shall, at the same time, without a separate or specific request, submit those reports, data, or other information to the Council/franchising authority. However, unless specifically authorized by the State, an MCS provider shall not be required to submit state or federal tax returns, or any information exempted under federal privacy laws, including Section 631 of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 551).

                (B) With respect to the reports required by this ordinance, it is noted that a non-exempted MCS provider shall timely submit any required report including, but not limited to the following:

   (1) an annual compliance statement in the manner set forth in this ordinance;

   (2) a periodic gross revenue report in the manner set forth in this ordinance;

   (3) preventative maintenance reports in the manner set forth in this ordinance;

   (4) copies, if applicable, of the MCS provider's FCC Form 395-A (or successor form), or any supplemental forms relating to equal employment opportunity, and fair contracting practices; and

   (5) any other reports or information required by another Section of this ordinance, or by the Council/franchising authority which are necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City.

 

§9-31.  Books and Records
                (A) An MCS provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts, and records of the business and operations under, and in connection with, the MCS system.

                (B) The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to review (either by mail or at the MCS provider's local office) all records (pertaining to an MCS provider's cable and/or multi-channel operations) on seven (7) days written notice, unless specifically exempted by the Council/franchising authority. Such review, unless mutually agreed upon, or judicially ordered, should occur within the MCS provider's regular office hours.

                (C) The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to hire, at its own expense, an independent certified public accountant, or other business or financial expert, to review the books and records of an MCS provider. If after a financial audit it is determined that the MCS provider has underpaid amounts owed to the City, then the City may require the MCS provider to reimburse the City for the actual cost of the audit.

                (D) A false entry into the books and/or records of an MCS provider, made by an MCS provider, of a material and substantial fact shall constitute a material violation of this ordinance.

                (E) An MCS provider, at the local office shall keep complete and accurate books and records of the key aspects of the multi-channel system's operation for at least the preceding three (3) years in such a manner that all matters pertaining to the City, can be easily produced and/or verified at the City's request. Also, the MCS provider shall keep, at its local office any other applicable records and information that may be required by any other Federal or State agency having jurisdiction over MCS providers.

§9-37.  Annual Compliance Statement Required
                (A) Within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date that this ordinance becomes effective, the Council/franchising authority shall develop an MCS provider's compliance statement in an effort to determine whether such MCS provider is complying with the various provisions and/or requirements of this ordinance.

                (B) Prior to December 1, of each calendar year, the City shall furnish to each MCS provider, a compliance statement.

                (C) Prior to December 31, of each calendar year, each non-exempt MCS provider shall return to the Council/franchising authority a completed and executed (by owner or officer) compliance statement.

                (D) There shall be no charge or fee associated with returning the annual compliance statement. However, if the MCS provider supplies incomplete information which requires independent verification by the City or a consultant hired by the City, then the MCS provider may be required to reimburse the City for all costs associated with the independent verification. Moreover, failure to submit a statement by the deadline, or the provision of false information within a statement, may subject an affected MCS provider to any, and all, penalties and fines listed in this ordinance.

 

§9-38.  Notification of Customers and MCS Providers' Rights and Responsibilities; General Policy
                (A) The Council/franchising authority recognizes that it is critical that a customer of an MCS provider fully understands and realizes the rights and responsibilities of both the customer and MCS provider with respect to the provision, maintenance, and repair of multi-channel service.

                (B) Further, the Council/franchising authority believes that if sufficient information is provided to a customer on certain customer service practices such as rates, billing periods, number and types of services provided, and rules concerning equipment use and return, then that customer will have the information necessary to make an informed decision on what, if any, multi-channel services to subscribe to, and receive.

                (C) In order to provide customers with the variety of information needed to make an informed decision, and to ensure that customers are notified of their, and the MCS provider's rights and responsibilities with respect to the multi-channel system, an MCS provider must provide a customer with a written "Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and Responsibilities With Respect to the Provision of Multi-Channel Service."

                (D) The "Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and Responsibilities With Respect to the Provision of Multi-Channel Service" shall be provided at the time of initial installation. Thereafter, a subscriber shall be provided with a written "Notice" at least once every twelve (12) months. If, however, an MCS provider amends, repeals, adds, deletes, modifies, or makes other changes to any customer service practice that is required in this ordinance, then said MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with such written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such amendment, repeal, addition, deletion, modification, or other change.

                (C) The "Notice" shall be delivered to a subscriber via an insert in the subscriber's periodic invoice or through a special mailing.

 

§9-40.  Billing Practices
                (A) Within the "Notice" that is required by this ordinance, subscribers shall be informed of at least the following practices of an MCS provider:

   (1) billing procedures (including payments necessary to avoid discontinuance of service);

                (E) In any case where a subscriber requests a cancellation or reduction of service within thirty (30) days after the notification of a scheduled rate or charge adjustment, then the subscriber's liability for the newly implemented rate or charge shall cease from the moment that the rate or charge adjustment becomes effective.

 

§9-41.  Billing Credit or Refunds for Service Outages, Interruptions; Substandard Signal or Picture
Quality or Unsolicited Service
                (A) An MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with credit or a rebate for a service outage or interruption exceeding eight (8) hours in duration, which credit, for purposes of determining the amount of the credit or rebate, shall be deemed to be equivalent to or the same as a twenty-four (24) hour service outage.

                (B) Where not expressly prohibited by the State, the Council/franchising authority may prescribe rules for giving credit to a subscriber in cases of substandard signal or picture quality.

                (C) In the case of a charge for unsolicited service, an MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with an adjustment or billing credit on the next available billing statement. Moreover, in such a case, an MCS provider shall not consider a subscriber delinquent for failure to pay a charge for unsolicited service.

 


§9-42.  Prohibition Against Multiple Changes of Service Tiers or Service Clusters Within a 365 Day
Period
                (A) To prevent "bait and switch" tactics, and to promote stability with respect to multi-channel services provided on a multi-channel system, an MCS provider may not switch any particular multi-channel service from one (1) service tier or service cluster more than twice during any three hundred sixty (365) day period.

                (B) Nothing contained in this Section should be construed as mandating any particular programming service being provided to a subscriber. Nor should this Section be construed as requiring any particular programming service be provided on a particular tier or cluster. Rather, this Section is designed to promote tier or cluster stability, so that a subscriber may choose a tier or cluster that best suits the subscriber's individual programming and informational needs.

 

§9-43.  Customer Service Hours; Capabilities of Customer Service Office; and Telephones
                (A) In order to facilitate the needs of the local customers, an MCS provider shall maintain a customer service office which is both within the City, and easily accessible to customers.

                (B) The customer service office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week (exclusive of holidays).

                (C) Within the forty (40) hours per week that a customer service office must be open, an MCS provider must provide office hours either on at least two (2) evenings (after 5 p.m.), or on Saturdays and/or Sundays (if not prohibited by State law).

                (D) The customer service office should have an adequate and knowledgeable staff in order to handle the vast majority of customer service inquiries, specifically including, but not limited to: billing inquiries, refunds, service outages, equipment service and repair, payment of bills and other charges, and inquiries from disabled or physically-impaired customers.

                (E) MCS providers shall for a reasonable charge, provide customers with a monthly, bi-monthly, or weekly multi-channel programming service guide, listing and/or detailing the programs and services available during the time period. In lieu of providing a programming service guide via the mail, or a newspaper, or third party, the MCS provider may disseminate the information over a channel designated as a program preview or program listing channel.

                (F) At least annually, any MCS provider shall certify to the Council/franchising authority that each customer service representative (CSR) has taken and passed an MCS provider-implemented course designed to train CSRs to handle their jobs in a courteous, efficient, and responsive manner.

                (G) An MCS provider shall maintain at least one (1) toll-free and/or local telephone number to accommodate normal business inquiries.

                (H) An MCS provider shall maintain a separate twenty-four (24) hour toll-free telephone number to facilitate calls concerning repair of equipment and extended interruption of service. During any hours that the customer service office is open, the MCS provider must have or make available in-house personnel to address a customer's inquiries. During other hours, a telephone may be manned by an automatic answering device, provided that the use of an answering device or answering service still results in an initial phone call by the MCS provider within ninety (90) minutes, in order to at least determine the extent of the outage. The MCS provider shall not be required to make in-person telephone contacts to subscribers at a rate which exceeds sixty (60) calls per hour, and shall not be required to make such calls between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. for situations other than reports of service outages.

                (I) A non-exempt MCS provider shall have adequate staff and/or extension lines (except during special marketing promotion periods, peak billing cycles, and service outages) in order to handle call to the general information number to the following specifications:

   (1) Eighty-five percent (85%) of all customer calls received in a year shall be attended within three minutes by a representative of the MCS provider, or by a device that is capable of complaint or inquiry resolution; and

   (2) The rate of abandoned calls shall no be greater than fifteen percent (15%) over any consecutive six (6) month period of time. "Abandoned calls" shall in no event be deemed to include calls in which the caller hangs up within forty-five (45) seconds of making the call.

                (J) With respect to the specifications listed in subsection (I) of this Section, it shall be the MCS provider's responsibility to quarterly certify to the Council/franchising authority that the affected MCS provider is meeting the minimal specifications.

   (6) in times of a disaster emergency or other instances requiring an emergency alert, mandating an all channel video blanking capability, so that all channels would be blanked simultaneously with the audio alert signal, in order to increase the likelihood that hearing and sight-impaired customers would be alerted.

 

§9-45.  Preferential or Discriminatory Practices Prohibited
                (A) An MCS provider shall not, as to rules, regulations, rates, charges, provision of service, or use of a provider's facilities and equipment, make, allow, or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person, nor subject any person to prejudice or disadvantage on the basis of age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin, handicap, religious affiliation or location of residence.

                (B) Consistent with Section 621 (a) (3) of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 541 (a) (3)), MCS providers classified as cable operators shall not deny cable service, or the extension of cable service, to any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.

                (C) Consistent with subsections (A) and (B) of this Section, an MCS provider shall not provide multi-channel service in a "cherry-picking" or "cream-skimming" manner or fashion, to the exclusion of other residents based on the excluded residents' income.

                (D) Subsection (A) of this Section, however, does not prohibit an MCS provider from offering a promotional or incentive discount rate or charge as long as the rate or charge does not exceed three hundred seventy (370) days in length. This subsection does not prohibit an MCS provider from offering special incentive rates such as one (1) month basic service free, if twelve (12) months of basic service are paid in one payment or within a certain time-frame.

                (E) Subsection (A) of this Section, also does not prohibit an MCS provider from denying service based on location of residence, if that residence is outside the parameters for line extension as detailed in a franchise agreement (if applicable).

                (F) Subsection (A) of this Section also does not prohibit an MCS provider from implementing a carefully designed no-frills service tier or service cluster for "lower income", and/or fixed income individuals.

                (G) Subsection (1) of this Section also does not prohibit an MCS provider from making agreements or entering into multi-channel service agreements with multiple dwelling unit owners (including hotel, motel, and manufactured home park owners) to provide multi-channel service under a bulk billing or other type of arrangement.

 

§9-46.  Use of Equipment, Return of Equipment, Security Deposits, and their Return
                (A) Prior to formally delivering any equipment, including auxiliary equipment (such as a converter, input selector switch, or video control recorder) to a customer, an MCS provider shall have tested a representative sample (at least one percent (1%)) of such equipment to make sure that it is in proper working order.

                (B) If needed for proper operation, or requested by a customer, an MCS provider shall deliver to a customer, handwritten or typed instructions detailing the proper use of rented, loaned, or purchased equipment. Unless required by another Section of this ordinance, an MCS provider may comply with this Section by delivering the manufacturer's instructions to a customer.

                (C) An MCS provider is not required to seek a security deposit from a customer for use or rental of the MCS provider's equipment.

                (D) An MCS provider shall comply with any, and all, applicable State rules concerning security deposits.

                (E) If the State is silent on the security deposit for a particular piece of equipment, then the MCS provider shall be prohibited from charging any security deposit for equipment which exceeds the replacement cost to the MCS provider.

                (F) As a matter of consumer protection, an MCS provider shall be prohibited from charging any security deposit for multi-channel service which exceeds twice the basic monthly rate.

                (G) An MCS provider shall return a security deposit (together with any interest earned) after the equipment is satisfactorily returned, or the subscriber maintains a satisfactory payment history (which is determined as no payment delinquencies within the preceding twelve (12) month period).

                (H) A customer shall maintain any equipment rented or leased from an MCS provider in good working order, and operate such equipment only in the manner specified by the MCS provider or manufacturer of the equipment.

                (I) A customer shall totally and fully reimburse an MCS provider for any damage or loss to an MCS provider's equipment that is due to the customer's failure to properly maintain and operate such equipment.

                (J) A customer shall be relieved from any responsibility for reimbursing an MCS provider for equipment which malfunctions or does not operate due to a hidden or latent defect in the equipment, or for equipment which fails to operate, or improperly operates due to natural occurrences conditioned by the normal wear and tear of such equipment, or for equipment damaged or destroyed by an act of nature, and which is not covered by a customer's home or apartment insurance policy.

 

§9-47.  Service Inquiry Logs
                (A) An MCS provider shall be required to keep and maintain service inquiry logs, subject to any limitations imposed by State or Federal law, including (for MCS providers classified as cable operators) any subscriber privacy limitations imposed by the CCPA.

                (B) The purpose of the service inquiry logs is to assist the City in assessing the type, degree, and rate of resolution of customer service requests, inquiries, and complaints.

                (C) At a minimum, the service inquiry logs should contain the following:

                (D) In addition to any other right of inspection that the Council/franchising authority may possess, it shall have the right to review and inspect a compilation of such logs. However, the Council/franchising authority shall not have the right of access, review, or inspection for any service inquiry logs or any information contained within service inquiry logs that are otherwise protected from access, review, or inspection by State or Federal law.

                (E) This Section does not require MCS providers to maintain service inquiry logs on scheduled installations.

                (D) The requirements imposed upon the MCS provider extend to any subcontractor or independent contractor that the MCS provider might employ to perform the tasks outlined in this Section.

                (E) In light of the foregoing, an MCS provider has the authority and responsibility to diligently trim trees of a private property owner (including a subscriber), but only to the extent necessary to prevent the branches of the trees from coming in contact with the MCS provider's wires and cables.

Moreover, except in emergency situations, an MCS provider shall inform the customer whether the service call is scheduled for the morning, afternoon, or evening hours.

                (D) In the case of a defective, improperly operating, or non-operating piece of equipment, a non-exempt MCS provider shall respond to, and make repairs as are necessary to correct the problem within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the MCS provider first received notification of the defective, improperly operating, or non-operating piece of equipment.

                (E) In the case of repair to a piece of equipment in a subscriber's residence, or repair to the cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent), the repair should be completed, and the situation resolved, at the conclusion of the first service visit. If the repair is not completed and resolved within three (3) visits, and if as a result of the insufficient repair, a situation remains wherein there is a visually or audibly detected degradation of a multi-channel signal by human eye or ear, then the MCS provider must immediately, and completely replace all drop cable (coaxial, fiber or its functional equivalent), and/or any necessary MCS provider equipment at no charge.

                (F) In no case shall a subscriber's service request or inquiry go unresponded or unattended to for more than twelve (12) hours from the time the MCS provider first received notification of the service inquiry or request. Moreover, except in emergency situations, all requests and inquiries shall be handled or corrected within thirty-six (36) hours from the time the MCS provider first received notification. If a cancellation of a service call occurs, then the MCS provider shall re-schedule the call in a manner consistent with the guidelines expressed in subsection (A) of this Section.

                (G) A complaint/inquiry regarding loss of all channels comprising a service level, cluster, or tier will be responded to, and corrected, within six hours (6) from the time the MCS provider first received notification of the loss of all channels comprising a service level, or service tier, or service cluster.

                (H) In case of a dispute concerning the precise time that the MCS provider received notification, or the precise circumstances surrounding the MCS provider receiving the notification, or whether notification was received at all, the Council/franchising authority shall reserve the right and authority to settle such a dispute.

                (I) New installations, upgrades, or reconnections of multi-channel service by an MCS provider shall be performed and completed within seven (7) days of a customer requesting such a new installation, upgrade, or reconnection.

 

§9-53.  MCS Providers Required to Maintain Sufficient Repair Parts and Sufficient Repair
Personnel
                (A) Except in times of natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider shall, at all times, have access to, and be able to secure, sufficient maintenance and repair parts and equipment for the MCS system, so that the MCS provider can respond to, and correct, all subscriber service interruptions within the time periods specified in this ordinance.

                (B) Having access to, and being able to secure sufficient maintenance and repair parts and equipment, is necessary to promptly restore a subscriber's multi-channel service, and avoid delays caused by having to obtain needed parts and equipment.

                (C) Except in times of natural or man-made emergency, or strike (whose duration has been less than seventy-two (72) hours), an MCS provider shall have sufficient maintenance and repair personnel, so that the MCS provider can respond to, and correct, subscriber service interruptions within the time periods specified in this ordinance.

                (D) An MCS provider shall annually certify to the Council/franchising authority that each service technician has taken and passed an MCS provider-implemented course designed to train service technicians to handle their jobs in a courteous, efficient, and responsive manner. Also, the course should be designed to provide continuing education to service technicians in changes in technology, repair/maintenance procedures and related matters.

                (E) Notwithstanding the other requirements and provisions in this Section, an MCS provider shall maintain at least one (1) service technician on call twenty-four (24) hours per day.

 

§9-54.  Disconnection for Non-Payment
                (A) A subscriber shall not be considered delinquent in payment until at least forty-five (45) days after the posting of the bill to the subscriber, and payment has not been received by an MCS provider.

                (B) Before disconnection of a subscriber's multi-channel service (either physically or electronically) takes place, the following must occur:

   (1) the subscriber must in fact be delinquent in payment of multi-channel service; and

   (2) at least five (5) days have elapsed after a separate written notice of impending disconnection has been personally served upon the subscriber; or

   (3) at least eight (8) days have elapsed after mailing a separate written notice of impending disconnection to the subscriber; or

   (4) at least five (5) days have elapsed after the subscriber has either signed for or, refused to accept, a separate written notice of impending disconnection.

                (C) The written notice of disconnection must expressly and clearly state the amount that is owed by the subscriber to an MCS provider, the minimum amount required to be paid to avoid disconnection, and the date and place where such payment must be made.

                (D) An MCS provider who physically retrieves its equipment including converter, remote control unit, or digital audio tuner), from a subscriber, must do so within both a normal service day and normal service hours of an MCS provider.

                (E) Receipt of a "bad check" from a subscriber, in response to a written notice of disconnection, does not constitute payment, and the affected MCS provider need not give the subscriber further notice prior to disconnecting multi-channel service.

                (F) An MCS provider may add a reasonable collection charge to the subscriber's bill if the applicable provisions of this ordinance, and any applicable State regulations, are followed.

                (G) Any refund due a subscriber after such a disconnection shall be made within sixty (60) days of the disconnection for non-payment.

 

§9-55.  Voluntary Disconnections and Downgrades
                (A) At any time, a subscriber may request that a particular service tier, service cluster, pay channel, premium channel, informational service, or the entire multi-channel service be disconnected.

                (B) Where provided by an MCS provider, a subscriber may request a downgrade from a particular level of service to a less comprehensive level of service, or a less expensive level of service.

                (C) From the date that such a subscriber makes such a request for either a disconnection or downgrade, then the MCS provider shall have seventy-two (72) hours or three (3) service days, whichever is longer, to disconnect or downgrade the service tier, pay channel, premium channel, informational service, or entire multi-channel service. In the event that an MCS provider does not disconnect or downgrade service within seventy-two (72) hours, a subscriber's obligation to pay for such service shall cease, or in the case of a downgrade, a subscriber's obligation to pay for the more comprehensive and/or higher priced service shall cease.

                (D) For a service tier, service cluster, premium channel or informational service which is voluntarily disconnected, a subscriber shall pay a pro rata share of the monthly rate for such service tier, service cluster, premium channel or informational service.

                (E) No separate disconnect or downgrade charge may be passed on to a subscriber if it chooses to take advantage of a lower-priced service tier/cluster or an optional service tier/cluster. However, to prevent subscriber abuse of this voluntary disconnection, or downgrade policy, a subscriber shall be charged a minimum one (1) months full rate for any one service tier/cluster which is disconnected and/or downgraded at least three (3) times within a span of one hundred eighty (180) days.

                (F) If, however, an MCS provider's equipment is, or has been damaged by a subscriber, prior to such disconnection, then the MCS provider may charge the subscriber with the entire cost for such damage, provided that the MCS provider notifies the subscriber within ten (10) days of the disconnection. A subscriber shall not be required to pay for equipment failure, if the circumstances fall within the normal wear and tear guidelines established in this ordinance.

                (G) Any refund due a subscriber after disconnection (both for non-payment and voluntary) shall be made within sixty (60) days after such disconnection.

                (H) In no event will this Section be viewed as abridging or otherwise limiting the rights and remedies afforded by the subscriber complaint/inquiry resolution process outlined in this ordinance.

§9-63.  Resolution of Complaints/Inquiries
                (A) An MCS provider is required to develop a comprehensive complaint/inquiry resolution policy that is consistent with the rules and regulations outlined in this ordinance.

                (B) An MCS provider's complaint/inquiry resolution policy shall be reduced to writing, and such policy shall be available upon request, to any person. In any event, a subscriber shall receive notice of such policy in the manner that is prescribed by this ordinance.

                (C) The Council/franchising authority shall establish a neutral, third-party appeal process, to handle complaints/inquiries that are not satisfactorily resolved at the MCS provider level.

   (3) complaints/inquiries that fall into the category of service inquiries shall abide by the procedure set forth in this ordinance;

   (4) informing subscribers of the credit/refund policy which is consistent with this ordinance, and any applicable State regulations; and

§9-64.  Policy With Respect to Continuity of Multi-Channel Service Provisions
                (A) The Council/franchising authority declares that as part of its right to establish multi-channel customer service guidelines, it has the duty to ensure continuity of multi-channel service for all subscribers. In that light, the Council/franchising authority also determines that it may take appropriate measures in order to ensure that no portion of the City is threatened or faced with a disruption, interruption, or discontinuance of multi-channel service due to the actions of any MCS provider.

                (B) In addition to the principles and ideals enumerated in subsection (A), the Council/franchising authority also expresses that its policy covers the following:

   (1) to provide for continuity of multi-channel service in the event of acquisition by the City;

   (2) to provide for continuity of service in the event of a proposed abandonment, withdrawal, or cessation of multi-channel service by an MCS provider;

   (3) to provide for continuity of service in the event of revocation, termination, or non-renewal of a franchised MCS provider's franchise;

   (4) to provide for continuity of service in the event that a transaction occurs that affects the ownership or control of the MCS provider, such as an assignment, sale, transfer, or merger;

   (5) to provide for continuity of service in the event of an expiration of a franchise;

   (6) to prevent disruption of multi-channel service which would provide a hardship on those subscribers who rely on a multi-channel system as their primary or secondary source for information; and

   (7) to prevent the interruption or cessation of multi-channel service which would disrupt or eliminate the diversity of programming choices enjoyed by subscribers of a multi-channel system, and thereby restricting their ability to receive information.

                (C) In any situation (including those mentioned above) which threatens the City and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-channel service, then the MCS provider shall provide the Council/franchising authority with at least forty-five (45) days notice (except in extreme circumstances) prior to the effective date of any action which would cause a loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-channel service. The purpose of the notice is to apprise the Council/franchising authority of the possibility of such loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-channel service, so that it might explore its options and take appropriate measures.

                (D) Whenever any situation occurs (including those mentioned above) which threatens the City and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-channel service, then the Council/franchising authority may direct the MCS provider for a period of up to twenty-four (24) months to do everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted multi-channel service of the same quality, mix, and level(s) regardless of the circumstances.

                (E) During the interim period, the Council/franchising authority shall work with the MCS provider in order to secure a new multi-channel system owner, or rectify the problem, so that the threat of loss of continuity is removed at the earliest possible instance.

                (F) During any interim period in which the MCS provider continues to provide multi-channel service to subscribers, the MCS provider is entitled to all revenues collected, except any sums owed (including franchise fees, alternative user charges, and taxes) to the City or to other persons.

                (G) In the event that the threat of loss of continuity is not resolved within twenty-four (24) months, then the Council/franchising authority may extend the interim period on a month-to-month basis until the situation is satisfactorily resolved. Also, in such a circumstance, the Council/franchising authority may adopt any emergency rules or procedures which will ensure that the subscribers will receive continuous, uninterrupted multi-channel service of the same quality, mix, and level(s).

 

§9-65.  Continued Use of Individual Antennas Protected
                (A) The Council/franchising authority does not intend to prohibit the erection or continued use of individual television antennas within the City so long as the individual television antennas conform to any and all applicable zoning and/or land use regulations. Consequently, no person shall be required to receive multi-channel service, or to physically connect to a multi-channel system.

                (B) It is also noted that no person shall be penalized or fined (through either a home sales contract, deed of restrictive covenants, or other type of agreement) for failing or refusing to receive multi-channel service, or physically connecting to a multi-channel system.

 

§9-66.  Periodic Multi-Channel Subscriber Surveys
                (A) At least every three (3) years after the adoption of this ordinance, the City and any affected MCS provider shall conduct a survey of current subscribers of that particular MCS provider in order to ascertain the degree of customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the subscriber sensitive aspects of the multi-channel system including (but not limited to) billing practices, response times, programming choices available and receivable, responsiveness to inquiries, and use, availability, and accessibility of any customer service office.

                (B) If the survey results indicate or demonstrate that the customer service practices set forth in this ordinance are not sufficient to meet reasonable or identified projected City needs, then the Council/franchising authority may take whatever measures are appropriate in order to rectify the deficiency or insufficiency in a particular customer service practice by one or more MCS providers.

   (8) maintain all permits and licenses, as noted in this ordinance.

 

§9-72.  Construction of Good Quality
                During any phase of construction, installation, maintenance, and repair of the multi-channel system, the MCS provider shall use materials of good and durable quality and all such work shall be performed in a safe, thorough, and reliable manner.

 

§9-73.  Conditions on Use of Streets and Public Ways
                (A) All wires, conduits, cable (coaxial, fiber, or functional equivalent), and other property and facilities of an MCS provider shall be so located, constructed, installed, and maintained so as not to endanger or unnecessarily interfere with usual and customary use, traffic and travel upon the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the City.

                (B) In the event an MCS provider's system creates a hazardous or unsafe condition or an unreasonable interference with property, then at its own expense such MCS provider shall voluntarily, or upon the request of the Council/franchising authority, remove that part of the system that creates the hazardous condition from the subject property.

                (C) An MCS provider shall not place equipment where it will interfere with the rights of property owners or with gas, electric or telephone fixtures, or with water hydrants or mains, or with wastewater lift stations, or any other service or facility that benefits the City's or its residents' health, safety, or welfare.

                (D) An MCS provider, at either its own expense or that of a private contractor, shall protect, rights-of-way, easements, and support or temporarily disconnect or relocate in the same street or other public way, any property of such MCS provider when necessitated by reason of:

   (1) traffic conditions;

   (2) public safety;

   (3) a street closing;

   (4) street construction or resurfacing;

   (5) change or establishment of street grade;

   (6) installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, storm drains, lift stations, force mains, power or signal lines; or

   (7) any improvement, construction or repair related to the City's or its residents health safety, or welfare.

                (E) It shall be the responsibility of an MCS provider (acting alone or in conjunction with another person) to locate and mark or otherwise visibly indicate and alert others to the location of its underground cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) before employees, agents, or independent contractors of such MCS provider, install cable in the marked-off area.

                (F) An MCS provider shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit, temporarily remove, raise or lower the cable wires to allow the moving of the building. The expense of temporary removal shall be paid by the person requesting it, and such MCS provider may require payment in advance. The affected MCS provider shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days notice of a contemplated move to arrange for temporary wire changes.

                (G) For any new installations occurring after the effective date of this ordinance, and at the time that an MCS provider rebuilds or upgrades the multi-channel system, all trunk or feeder cable (coaxial, fiber, or functional equivalent) shall be placed underground. Further, where both power and utilities are presently underground, multi-channel system cable shall be placed underground also.

 

§9-74.  Franchised MCS Provider's Duty to Remove Franchised Properties from the Public Streets
                (A) This Section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a franchise to operate within the City.

                (B) Whenever the following occurs:

   (1) a franchised MCS provider ceases to operate all, or part, of the multi-channel system for a continuous period of six (6) months;

   (2) a franchised MCS provider ceases and fails to construct the multi-channel system outlined in the application, or proposal for renewal, or renewal franchise agreement;

   (3) the Council/franchising authority elects not to renew the franchise pursuant to the provisions set forth, in this ordinance; or

   (4) the franchised MCS provider's franchise is revoked pursuant to the provisions set forth in this ordinance;

Then-unless the City or another MCS provider uses such multi-channel system, under the continuity provisions outlined in this ordinance, the affected franchised MCS provider shall promptly remove its multi-channel system property from the streets, public ways, and private property located within the City.

                (C) If not removed voluntarily by a franchised MCS provider, then the Council/franchising authority may notify such franchised MCS provider that if removal of the property is not accommodated within two hundred seventy (270) days, or substantial progress towards removal is not made within two hundred ten (210) days, then the Council/franchising authority may direct officials or representatives of the City to remove such franchised MCS provider's system property at that franchised MCS provider's expense. The performance and/or construction bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, or full faith and credit guarantee required as set forth in this ordinance shall be available to pay for such work.

                (D) If officials or representatives of the City remove a franchised MCS provider's system property, and such franchised MCS provider does not claim the property within ninety (90) days of its removal, then the Council/franchising authority may take whatever steps are available under State law to declare the property surplus, and sell it, with the proceeds of such sale (if permitted by State law) going to the City.

                (E) When such franchised MCS provider removes its multi-channel system property from the streets, public ways, and private property located within the City, the franchised MCS provider shall, at its own expense, and in a manner approved by the Council/franchising authority, replace and restore such public or private property in as good a condition as before the work causing the disturbance was done.

 

§9-75.  Construction Standards
                (A) Methods of construction, installation, maintenance repair of any multi-channel system shall comply with the most current editions of the National Electrical Safety Code, and the National Electric Code, as affects the construction, installation, and maintenance of electrical supply and communication lines and attachments and supports. To the extent that these are inconsistent with other provisions of a franchise, or State, or local law, then the more stringent shall govern in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

                (B) All installations shall treat the aesthetics of the property as a priority, shall not substantially affect the appearance of the structure, and shall not be installed on the bias across property or the face or side of a home or building without the owner's permission.

                (C) No home/building within 150 feet of the system shall be served by a drop with any pole span being longer than 150 feet without the owner's permission.

                (D) All underground drops shall follow property lines and cross property only at right angles, unless otherwise permitted by the owner.

 

§9-76.  System Construction Schedule For Franchised MCS Providers
                (A) This Section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a franchise to operate with the City.

                (B) A franchised MCS provider's construction schedule for the multi-channel system shall be detailed in the franchise agreement in a form and format determined by the Council/franchising authority.

                (C) A franchised MCS provider who does not abide by the system construction schedule shall be handled in the manner allowed under either this ordinance, or where applicable, a franchise agreement.

 

§9-77.  System Expansion for MCS Providers
                (A) The Council/franchising authority recognizes that one of its primary purposes in the franchising process is to ensure that the widest diversity of programming sources be available to the greatest number of City residents. The Council/franchising authority is also cognizant that an MCS provider may have some constitutionally protected rights with respect to when and what areas of the City are provided service.

                (B) In order to balance those interests, the Council/franchising authority sets the minimum guidelines for any system expansion on the part of a franchised MCS provider.

                (C) A franchised MCS provider shall submit, within six (6) months of the effective date of this ordinance, a detailed plan for multi-channel system expansion to any area not presently served within the City. Provided, however, no such plan shall be accepted by the Council/franchising authority as to any area less than the entire City limits if a non-exempt MCS provider has already submitted such a plan as part of a franchise. Such plan should not be construed as a requirement for universal service, but rather as a means for achieving the Council/franchising authority's goals, mentioned in Subsection (A). However, at a minimum, a franchised MCS provider shall extend multi-channel service to any area within the City that has a density of ten (10) homes or building passings per mile, or fractional equivalent thereof, as measured from the extremity of the system nearest the unserved area. Also, in such a case, a newly installed subscriber shall not be assessed or apportioned the cost for installation, except for the usual and normal connection fees paid by subscribers, so long as the system expansion is technically feasible.

                (D) The detailed plan must include criteria for:

   (1) extending the provision of service to isolated subscribers;

   (2) extending the provision of service to new or existing developments with overhead cable construction; and

   (3) new or existing developments with underground cable construction.

                (E) The detailed plan must be reviewed and approved by the Council/franchising authority.

                (F) For purposes of this Section, "isolated subscribers'" means any potential customer of a franchised MCS provider who dwells in a house more than one-half (1/2) mile from the nearest franchised MCS provider connection.

 

§9-78.  Permits and Licenses
                An MCS provider shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses required by law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, and maintain the same, in full force and effect, for as long as required.

§9-86.  Council/Franchising Authority's Policy With Respect to Safety Requirements
                (A) The Council/franchising authority requires that the MCS provider's construction, operation, and maintenance of the multi-channel system meet certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the public and lessen the likelihood of interruption of multi-channel service.

                (B) Consequently, the Council/franchising authority requires any non-exempt MCS provider to adopt the following safety requirements:

   (1) emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this ordinance;

   (2) minimum standby power as noted in this ordinance;

   (3) the provision of an indoor signal or safety alert technology in the manner noted in this ordinance;

   (4) implementing a periodic preventative maintenance program as set forth in this ordinance;

   (5) follow all FCC rules and regulations concerning maximum cumulative leakage index (CLI) limits; and

   (6) comply with, and abide by, any construction, safety or fire codes as noted in this ordinance.

 

§9-87.  Provisions to Alert Subscribers in the Event of an Emergency; Standby Power
                (A) In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending, imminent or actual, natural or man-made emergency, then all MCS providers shall ensure that the multi-channel system providing multi-channel service to all, or part, of the City is designed so as to permit an authorized official of the City to override the audio portion of all channels, by touch-tone phone (or functional equivalent) from any location.

                (B) In addition to any other requirements listed in this Section, an MCS provider shall:

   (1) designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of both audio and video;

   (2) inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel at least daily on at least one (1) channel of the multi-channel system;

   (3) maintain all channel video blanking capability to facilitate the needs of hearing and sight-impaired customers;

   (4) test the emergency override system not less than once a month;

   (5) cooperate with the City on the use and operation of the emergency alert override system; and

   (6) develop a plan (with the City's concurrence) in order to provide continuity of multi-channel service, and response to service calls in the event of a natural or man-made emergency.

                (C) As one method of providing continuity of multi-channel services in the event of a natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider shall, unless exempted by the Council/franchising authority, have the capacity for four (4) hour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and feeder cable, and all headends, hubs, and receive sites associated with the distribution of cable service to, and throughout the City.

 

§9-88.  Provisions Concerning Safety Alert Technology
                (A) The Council/franchising authority considers the need for an indoor signal or safety alert technology, available to both subscribers and non-subscribers of an MCS provider's lowest level of programming service, of paramount interest and need, and as such should be an integral part of an MCS provider's system. Though in some ways similar to the concept of emergency alert override, signal alert technology is different and distinct in that it may be used by both subscribers to basic service and non-subscribers to the basic service of an MCS provider's system. Moreover, such safety alert technology is connected to the National Weather Service twenty-four (24) hour radio service including its new WRSAME/"Site Select" weather and warning system, which specifically allows for an indoor warning and notification via an audio alert voice path, regardless of whether an individual has a television receiver or monitor, or an FM receiver, and, moreover, can provide effectively instantaneous alert and warning, as well as needed instructions, in addition to allowing key community-oriented entities to communicate with both the general populace and selected (i.e. target) segments of the community.

                (B) In realization and recognition of the preceding, a non-exempt MCS provider shall offer for use throughout the City (within twelve (12) months of the effective date of this ordinance) a signal or safety alert monitoring technology for purposes of alerting both subscribers and non-subscribers of a multi-channel system to impending or occurring disaster emergencies, and allowing the City to communicate with both subscribers and the public as the need to do so may exist at any time.

                (C) A non-exempt MCS provider shall cooperate with the City and the provider of said technology in the marketing and distribution of the necessary on-premises alert receiving devices, including the installation, and replacement of such, as may be needed from time to time.

                (D) A non-exempt MCS provider shall install the necessary electronics, processing, and distribution equipment in the MCS provider's headend, and will ensure the maintenance, operating condition, and replacement of such equipment, as is necessary to protect its continued use.

                (E) Notwithstanding the preceding, a non-exempt MCS provider has no responsibility for repair of such equipment beyond obtaining (in a timely manner) replacement from the manufacturer for inoperable components.

                (F) It is explicitly understood that one need not be a subscriber to a multi-channel system to use the safety alert device, and receive the safety alert service, so long as a drop is installed into the address to which said device is attached. It is also understood that the user need not have a television receiver.

                (G) The Council/franchising authority recognizes the positive effect on the safety of the public in general, and the ability to save lives, and property, of those who would otherwise be prevented from receiving the most expeditious warning or alert possible without such a device and technology. Consequently, the Council/franchising authority requires that all non-exempt MCS providers shall participate in a periodic public awareness campaign as deemed appropriate by the Council/franchising authority, in cooperation with the Council/franchising authority and the manufacturer, to inform the citizenry and non-cable subscribers of the availability and capability of such safety alert technology.

                (H) An MCS provider shall assure that all subscribers to multi-channel service receive printed material, fully describing the technology and its benefits, at least annually and at the time of installation.

                (I) An MCS provider shall allow non-subscribers of Basic Cable Service the choice of purchasing or leasing the necessary equipment, which shall include the cost of installation on a non-discriminatory basis, and so inform such persons of both options.

                (J) Given the significant public safety and life and property saving benefits of this technology, and the resultant need of as much of the general public as possible to be protected from the otherwise unnecessary greater risk to life, limb and property associated with other alert/warning systems, an MCS provider shall assure that the service is placed on the same level of service and is priced commensurate with that for like technology/service in the Mid-Western United States.

                (K) Given the importance and critical nature of preventing the loss of life and property, and the need and ability of the Council/franchising authority to communicate directly with the public in any number of situations, including but not limited to those potentially involving matters of life and death, and as this technology is clearly not a programming service, the Council/franchising authority deems it appropriate to designate the use of the capability of such technology as a governmental use of the system, and it is the intent of the City that it be made available to all subscribers.

 

§9-89.  Implementation of a Preventative Maintenance Program
                (A) It shall be the duty of an MCS provider (that has more than three hundred fifty subscribers) to devise and implement a quarterly preventative maintenance program for the multi-channel system in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the multi-channel system that would affect the citizens' health, safety, and welfare, or negatively affect the quality of multi-channel services being provided.

                (B) Before the MCS provider implements such a program, it shall be reviewed and approved by the Council/franchising authority. Within forty-five (45) days after the completion of the quarterly preventative maintenance program, the MCS provider shall prepare and submit a written report to the Council/franchising authority detailing the results of the tests conducted, and all items performed or addressed during the quarterly program. Although not exhaustive, the following areas should be included in a preventative maintenance program, and subsequent report:

   (1) inspection, and repair if needed, of the headend;

   (2) inspection, and repair if needed, of the antenna tower;

   (3) requiring weather-proofing and protection of the antenna lead connectors, and on any other exposed fittings;

   (4) requiring the conducting of signal leakage tests that are in accordance with FCC requirements;

   (5) removing tree roots, limbs, and branches that interfere with, or come in contact with, the MCS provider's cable;

   (6) requiring the periodic servicing, testing, and calibration of the MCS provider's equipment including equipment on service vehicles, and field test equipment;

   (7) employing a status monitoring system to identify problems or situations in which the multi-channel system electronics are operating outside pre-programmed parameters;

   (8) testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will function properly during an emergency situation; and

   (9) testing of the safety alert system or technology.

 

§9-90.  Construction, Fire, and Safety Codes
                (A) An MCS provider shall construct, operate, maintain, repair, remove, replace, or restore the multi-channel system in strict compliance with all current technical codes adopted by the Council/franchising authority, the State, or the United States.

                (B) The codes referred to specifically include, but are not limited to, construction, fire and safety, and zoning codes.

§9-96.  Alternative User Charge
                (A) This Section is applicable to any unfranchised, but otherwise authorized MCS provider, and to any MCS provider who has had its franchise ruled unconstitutional, unenforceable, or invalid. For all franchised MCS providers the provisions concerning franchise fees shall be applicable.

                (B) Where not specifically prohibited by Federal or State law, and as an alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this ordinance, the Council/franchising authority may impose, extract, and collect, a charge from an affected MCS provider for the use by such provider of the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the City.

                (C) The alternative user charge shall be based on the following mathematical mode:

   (1) determine the present value of all public streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the City in which are located multi-channel system facilities and equipment of the affected MCS provider;

   (2) take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the City (as determined by the Property Appraiser for the City, for the five preceding years);

   (3) take the average percentage increase for the five preceding years and use it to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable, then use five years);

   (4) add the present value to the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);

   (5) divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);

   (6) multiply that figure by five percent (5%) to arrive at the annual user charge that is to be collected from the affected MCS provider.

For purposes of illustration only, the formula reads as follows:

present value = the dollar amount of the property value increase for remaining term of the franchise (based on average percentage increase of land appraisals for past years of franchise term; divide the adjusted present value by the remaining years on the term of the franchise;

multiply that figure by five percent (5%), = (equals) the annual alternative user charge.

                (D) The Council/franchising authority adopts such an alternative user charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected MCS provider's use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such MCS provider's annual gross revenues. However, an affected MCS provider may agree to an alternative charge that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenues, as long as that charge did not exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a percentage of an affected MCS provider's annual gross revenues.

                (E) It is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user charge will not be imposed on the same MCS provider at the same time, for the same period.

                (F) An affected MCS provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to pay an alternative user charge that exceeds the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a percentage of such MCS provider's gross revenues (as defined by this ordinance) for any particular reporting period. In the event that the alternative user charge does exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues, then such alternative user charge should be reduced to reflect an amount not greater than the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues.

                (G) An affected MCS provider shall pay twenty-five percent (25%) of the alternative user charge at the end of every three (3) months.

 

§9-97.  Franchise Required; Exception
                (A) Except as provided in subsections (B), (C), and (D) of this Section, no person, or MCS provider shall be permitted to construct, operate or maintain a multi-channel system which requires the laying or positioning of cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) across the rights-of-way of the City, without having first obtained a franchise, and then entering into a franchise agreement with the City.

                (B) Pursuant to the CCPA, a local government may own and operate a multi-channel system classified as a cable system. Consequently, should the Council/franchising authority directly, or indirectly, through any legal means available to the Council/franchising authority, decide to purchase, acquire, construct, lease, control, or otherwise own a cable system within the territorial limits of the City, then the Council/franchising authority shall not be required to submit a proposal for, or receive, a franchise in order to construct, operate, and maintain a cable system within the geographical limits of the City.

                (C) In the case of a person or MCS provider lawfully providing multi-channel service on July 1, 1984, then such person or MCS provider shall not be required to obtain a franchise, and enter into a franchise agreement unless the Council/franchising authority expressly requires the person or MCS provider to do so.

                (D) If, as a result of annexation (either previous to, or subsequent to, the effect date of this ordinance), an MCS provider comes under the jurisdiction of the City, then such MCS provider shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance, including (if applicable) obtaining a franchise. Any such franchise shall extend only to the territory comprising the annexed area. The provisions of Section 9-10 and 9-15 of this ordinance do not apply to this subsection.

                (E) Where a person or MCS provider is required by the Council/franchising authority to obtain a franchise, then the Council/franchising authority shall notify the person or MCS provider, in writing, within thirty (30) days of the Council/franchising authority's formal action.

                (F) After receipt of notification, the affected person or MCS provider has ninety (90) days to submit an application or proposal in substantially the same form and format as required by the Council/franchising authority. Then, the affected person or MCS provider's application will be handled as set forth by either State or local law.

 

§9-98.  Authority to Grant Non-Exclusive Franchises
                (A) Consistent with Section 621(a)(1) of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 541), the Council/franchising authority may award one (1) or more non-exclusive multi-channel service franchises within its geographical limits. With the exception of existing non-exempt MCS providers in an area annexed by the City and subject to Section 9-77 of this ordinance, the Council/franchising authority shall not award a franchise for a service area comprising less than the entire City limits. Note well, however, that existing non-exempt MCS providers as of the effective date of this ordinance may, but are not required to, serve any subsequently annexed area of the City in a manner consistent with line extension policies outlined in this ordinance, and which are specifically noted in the MCS provider's franchise agreement. The provisions of Section 9-10 and 9-15 of this ordinance do not apply to this subsection.

                (B) A franchised MCS provider shall be selected as part of a public proceeding and hearing which affords due process to both the City and the applicant, and after which, if the applicant is selected as a franchised MCS provider, then such applicant will enter into a franchise agreement with the City, pursuant to the provisions of federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

 

§9-99.  Franchise Agreement; Minimal Requirements
                (A) If the Council/franchising authority awards an applicant a franchise to construct, operate, or maintain a multi-channel system within the City, or approves a proposal for a renewal of a franchise, then within one hundred eighty (180) days, an applicant or a renewal franchised MCS provider and the City shall enter into a franchise agreement which details the rights, duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of both parties.

                (B) A newly franchised MCS provider may not lay any cable (coaxial, fiber, or functional equivalent) until the franchise agreement is executed by both the newly franchised MCS provider and the Council/franchising authority.

                (C) A franchise agreement shall be in sufficient detail in order to clearly delineate the rights and duties of the franchised MCS provider, and the Council/franchising authority.

                (D) At a minimum, a franchise agreement shall contain provisions for the following:

   (1) a detailed definition of "annual gross revenues" or "gross revenues" which specifically includes an explanation of what constitutes the revenue base for determining what revenues are subject to any franchise fee or alternative user charge;

   (2) the term or duration of the franchise;

   (3) indemnity and hold harmless clauses;

   (4) insurance;

   (5) performance and completion bonds or security deposits;

   (6) construction, upgrade or rebuild schedule;

   (7) franchise fees;

   (8) continuity of multi-channel programming service;

   (9) repeal of prior inconsistent franchise agreements; and

   (10) a severability clause.

 

§9-100.  Extent of Grant of Franchise
                (A) Upon an award of a franchise, and the subsequent execution of the franchise agreement, an MCS provider required to obtain and maintain a franchise may construct, erect, install, maintain, operate, repair, replace, remove, or restore a multi-channel system within the geographical limits set forth in the franchise agreement.

                (B) The franchised multi-channel system may be located in, upon, along, across, over, and under the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the City.

                (C) If necessary, the responsibility of obtaining easements for private property (including privately owned utility or street light poles) shall be that of a franchised MCS provider.

                (D) A franchised MCS provider, through a separate pole or utility easement agreement with an affected utility, may locate the multi-channel system on, or within, the property of such utility company. This provision specifically includes MCS providers classified as cable operators.

 

§9-101.  Term of Franchise
                (A) The term of an initial renewal franchise may be for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years from the date that a franchise renewal agreement is approved by the Council/franchising authority.

                (B) If an initial franchise or renewal franchise is for a period of six (6) years or less, then the franchise agreement shall detail the reasons for granting the shorter franchise term.

                (C) The reasons for a franchise term of six (6) years or less, include, and are limited to, the following:

   (1) multiple or repeated violations of the prior franchise agreement;

   (2) multiple or repeated violations of this ordinance, or any mandated provisions of the CCPA;

   (3) a continuing and documented pattern of substandard or non-responsive service;

   (4) reckless disregard for the safety and welfare of the citizens of the City;

   (5) failure to comply with any construction, rebuild, or upgrade schedule; and

   (6) failure to timely pay in their entirety any franchise fees, or taxes, or other charges due to the City.

                (D) The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to grant a franchised MCS provider a variable franchise term wherein the initial or renewal term may be extended by up to two (2) years (not to exceed fifteen (15) years total) upon the franchised MCS provider attaining an "excellent" rating during the course of a periodic performance evaluation.

                (E) The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to grant a franchised MCS provider a variable franchise term (wherein the initial or renewal term may be extended by up to two (2) years (not to exceed fifteen (15) years total) should the franchised MCS provider consistently and continually meet the Council/franchising authority's objectives with respect to the provision of broad categories of video programming as noted in this ordinance.

                (F) The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to reduce the term of the franchise by one (1) year for each material, repeated occurrence of an uncured/unremedied violation of the franchise or this ordinance, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 9-105 of this ordinance, or when the MCS provider fails to attain a minimum rating of "adequate" (on a scale of "excellent", "adequate" and "poor") for any two (2) successive periodic performance reviews, as set forth in Section 9-106 of this ordinance.

                (G) Should the highest court of the nation, or State, invalidate, void as unenforceable or unconstitutional, the concept of a franchise or franchise duration, then the Council/franchising authority may adopt emergency rules and regulations in order to preserve and protect the rights and duties of both the Council/franchising authority and any franchised MCS provider. During the interim, the invalid franchise may be considered (unless prohibited by the State) and interpreted in the same manner and fashion as a business license or other comparable authorization. Upon the adoption of emergency rules, the Council/franchising authority should enter into a new agreement which describes which terms and conditions of the franchised MCS provider's system may be reviewed and examined, and under what circumstances may a franchised MCS provider forfeit its right to operate a multi-channel system within the City.

 

§9-102.  Application for Franchise; Application Fee
                (A) The Council/franchising authority may develop rules and regulations with respect to the submission and processing of applications for a franchise. Such rules and regulations shall primarily be aimed at determining the legal, financial, technical, and character qualifications of the applicant.

                (B) Unless prohibited, an applicant shall pay an application fee which shall be equal to the administrative and consulting costs associated with processing an application for a franchise. The total application fee must be paid, unless waived, regardless of whether the applicant receives, or does not receive a franchise. The total application fee must be paid (or waived) prior to the Council/franchising authority's formal action on the applicant's request for a franchise.

 

§9-103.  Franchise Fees
                (A) Any non-exempt franchised MCS provider (specifically including any MCS provider classified as a cable operator) awarded a franchise or renewal franchise after the date this ordinance becomes effective, shall pay to the City for the privilege and use of the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways, and other facilities of the City in the operation of the multi-channel system, and for the City's supervision thereof during the term of the franchise, a sum equal to five percent to (5%) of the annual gross revenues of such non-exempt franchised MCS provider. Such fee shall explicitly be separate from, and in addition to, any fees or charges for the use or occupancy of any municipally-owned poles, conduits or other facilities owned by a municipally-owned utility.

                (B) If the FCC, Congress or other governmental entity with authority over multi-channel service ever allows a governmental entity or Council/franchising authority to increase the franchise fee beyond five percent (5%), then the Council/franchising authority shall have the authority to increase the franchise fee to the maximum rate allowable.

                (C) It is intended that the franchise fees will promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City. Therefore, the five percent (5%) franchise fee shall be deposited into the general revenues of the City, unless specifically authorized elsewhere.

                (D) A non-exempt franchised MCS provider shall file with the Council/franchising authority, within forty-five (45) days after the expiration of each of the franchised MCS provider's fiscal quarters, a detailed financial and revenue report clearly showing the gross revenues received by such franchised MCS provider during the preceding quarter and certified by a certified public accountant or officer of a franchised MCS provider attesting to the accuracy, completeness, and veracity of the revenue figures. Such report shall be in the form and format determined by the Council/franchising authority. Such report shall include revenue from whatever source, directly or indirectly derived from, or allowed, or caused to be derived from, or applicable to the operation of the multi-channel system, or the provision of any multi-channel service by or to the multi-channel system. Revenue will be reported by service category, type, and level showing computations and using incremental billing rates for all sources, levels, tiers, and types of service and other revenue sources of all kinds and types.

                (E) Payment of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be rendered to the City at the time the revenue report is filed.

                (F) In the event that payment is not made within forty-five (45) days after the date specified in this Section, then such franchised MCS provider may be declared in default of the franchise, and the franchise may be revoked, terminated, or canceled in the manner prescribed by this ordinance.

                (G) The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to audit a franchised MCS provider books, if the Council/franchising authority deems it necessary. If such audit discovers an underpayment of franchise fees that exceeds two percent (2%) of the total fee paid for any reporting quarter, then the affected franchised MCS provider shall reimburse the City for the cost of such an audit. It is specifically understood that the right of audit and recomputation of any, and all, amounts paid under a franchise fee, shall always be accorded to the Council/franchising authority.

                (H) All annual reports due and pertaining to the payment of franchise fees, will be certified by an officer of the franchised MCS provider, and such provider shall maintain records used in the preparation of said report, to be produced in their originality and totality upon request or demand by the Council/franchising authority.

                (I) No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release of, or an accord, or satisfaction of, any claim that the City might have for further or additional sums payable under the terms of this ordinance, or for any other performance or obligation of a franchised MCS provider hereunder.

                (J) Payments of compensation made by a franchised MCS provider to the City, pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance, shall be considered in addition to, and exclusive of, any and all authorized taxes, business license fees, other fees, other levies or assessments presently in effect, or subsequently adopted.

                (K) A franchise fee does not include any items excluded by Section 622 (g) (2) (D) of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 542 (g) (2) (D)).

                (L) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Council/franchising authority to impose a tax, fee or other assessment of any kind, on any person (other than a franchised MCS provider) with respect to multi-channel service or other programming or communications service provided by such person over a multi-channel system for which charges are assessed to subscribers, but not received by a franchised MCS provider. For purposes of illustration only, this subsection shall include the situation(s) where a premium service directly bills a subscriber, or the franchised MCS provider merely acts as collection agent for a premium service billing directly to a subscriber, or where a person leases a channel for commercial use and sells advertising or goods on that channel, and receives the money directly or through a third party.

                (M) For any twelve (12) month period, the fees paid by any person subject to subsection (L) who provides any such multi-channel service shall not exceed five percent (5%) of such person's gross revenues derived in such period from the provision of such service over the multi-channel system.

                (N) If at any time, the highest court of the nation, or the highest court of the State, invalidates, voids, or rules as unconstitutional the concept of franchise fees, then the Council/franchising authority may impose an alternative user charge on the franchised MCS provider, in the manner set forth in this ordinance.

 

§9-104.  Assignment or Transfer of Franchise
                (A) Where required for operation, an MCS provider's franchise may not be assigned or transferred in whole, or in part, by the affected MCS provider, without the prior express written approval by the Council/franchising authority.

                (B) Any attempted assignment or transfer without such prior written consent shall constitute a default of such franchise.

                (C) In the event of such a default, the Council/franchising authority shall proceed according to the procedure set forth in this ordinance, and any applicable State law.

                (D) At least ninety (90) days before a proposed assignment or transfer of an MCS provider's franchise is scheduled to become effective, such franchised MCS provider shall petition in writing for the Council/franchising authority's written consent for such a proposed assignment or transfer.

                (E) The Council/franchising authority will not unreasonably withhold its consent to such an assignment or transfer. However, in making such a determination, the Council/franchising authority may consider the following:

   (1) experience of proposed assignee or transferee (including conducting an investigation of proposed assignee or transferee's service record in other communities);

   (2) qualifications of proposed assignee or transferee;

   (3) legal integrity of proposed assignee or transferee;

   (4) financial ability and stability of the proposed assignee or transferee;

   (5) if requested by the Council/franchising authority, submittals from the proposed assignee or transferee, on what, if any, changes it intends to make in the operation and maintenance of the present multi-channel system;

   (6) the corporate connection, if any, between the franchised MCS provider, and proposed assignee or transferee;

   (7) the economic viability or non-viability of the multi-channel system in the future, based upon certain factors including the impact of the purchase price on the City and/or the proposed assignee or transferee; and

   (8) any other legitimate aspect of the proposed assignee's or transferee's background which could affect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry of City as it relates to the operation of the multi-channel system.

                (F) A copy of the completed sales agreement, or a functionally equivalent instrument, between the franchised MCS provider and proposed assignee or transferee shall be provided to the Council/franchising authority, so that the Council/franchising authority may discover the assumption of obligations by the franchised MCS provider and proposed assignee or transferee with respect to the multi-channel system. In lieu of the sales agreement, the Council/franchising authority may accept an attested summary of obligations assumed by the above referenced parties.

                (G) Before an assignment or transfer is approved by the Council/franchising authority, the proposed assignee or transferee shall execute an affidavit, acknowledging that it has read, understood, and intends to abide by both this ordinance, and the applicable franchise agreement.

                (H) In the event of any approved assignment or transfer, the assignee or transferee shall assume all obligations and liabilities of the former franchised MCS provider, except as noted in subsection (I).

                (I) An assignment or transfer shall not relieve the former franchised MCS provider of its liabilities under the franchise agreement until the assignment actually takes place, or unless specifically relieved by Federal, or State law, or unless specifically relieved by the Council/franchising authority at the time an assignment or transfer is approved.

 

§9-105.  Default of Franchise; Revocation, Termination or Cancellation of Franchise
                (A) When any event, act or omission (on the part of the franchised MCS provider) occurs which represents a violation of an integral provision of this ordinance, or compromises the corporate character, or legal, financial or technical integrity and/or stability of the multi-channel system or the franchised MCS provider to such a degree that the interests of the subscribers and users are negatively affected, then such event, act or omission may be considered a major breach of this ordinance. Under such circumstances, the Council/franchising authority shall notify the affected MCS provider in writing, of the specific breach, and direct such franchised MCS provider to comply with all such provisions of its proposal, franchise agreement, or this ordinance.

                (B) For illustrative purposes only, the events, acts and omissions include, but are not limited to: bankruptcy, insolvency, failure to pay taxes or franchise fees (including the alternative user charge if applicable), failure to receive written Council/franchising authority approval for an assignment or transfer, or failure to abide by the integral terms and conditions of the franchise agreement, or integral provisions of this ordinance.

                (C) Where a franchised MCS provider satisfactorily corrects any of the enumerated conditions, within sixty (60) days, then in no event shall the enumerated condition be weighed against such franchised MCS provider in any subsequent review of franchise performance.

                (D) A copy of such notice of material breach shall be mailed to the surety on the performance bond.

                (E) Within seventy-five (75) days, after such written notice is mailed to a franchised MCS provider, the Council/franchising authority shall conduct a public hearing on the matter.

                (F) The Council/franchising authority shall provide written notice to a franchised MCS provider, and the surety, of the time and place of said public hearing in a manner consistent with either State law, or approved by the Council/franchising authority.

                (G) At the time of the hearing, the affected franchised MCS provider may present information on the current status of the alleged breach of the franchise agreement. If the situation has been resolved, or steps are being taken to resolve the situation, then the franchised MCS provider should present the information at the hearing.

                (H) If the affected franchised MCS provider fails to attend the hearing, and has not requested a continuance of the hearing, then such franchised MCS provider shall be deemed to have waived its right to a further continuation of the matter, and may be declared in default of the franchise agreement.

                (I) After the public hearing, the Council/franchising authority may determine the franchised MCS provider to be in compliance and dismiss the matter, or may determine that the MCS provider has cured any non-compliance and thereby dismiss the matter. However the Council/franchising authority may determine that an ordinance violation exists and remains uncured. Consequently, upon a finding that the MCS provider violated an integral ordinance provision, or failed to cure an outstanding ordinance violation, the Council/franchising authority may direct the affected franchised MCS provider to take corrective action within a specified period of time, or may declare such franchised MCS provider in default of the franchise agreement, and thereafter may revoke, terminate, or cancel the franchise, unless the franchised MCS provider presents sufficient mitigating circumstances.

                (J) If the Council/franchising authority directs corrective action to take place within a specified time or declares such franchised MCS provider in default of the franchise agreement, then that declaration shall be reduced to writing, and the notice of corrective action or default shall be mailed to such franchised MCS provider, and surety, within fifteen (15) days of the Council/franchising authority's action.

                (K) If within forty-five (45) days, the affected franchised MCS provider, or surety does not take significant action to rectify the breach, or submit a plan detailing how the affected MCS provider will eliminate the breach, then the Council/franchising authority shall revoke such MCS provider's franchise, and shall notify the affected franchised MCS provider, and surety forthwith, unless there are mitigating circumstances.

 

§9-106.  Performance Evaluations
                The Council/franchising authority is authorized to design a performance evaluation procedure which periodically monitors compliance of the franchised MCS provider with the terms and conditions of both the franchise and this ordinance. Moreover, the Council/franchising authority may periodically review, and examine whether a franchised MCS provider's financial, technical, legal, and character qualifications continue to meet required operational, maintenance, and performance levels in order to ensure the uninterrupted provision of multi-channel services. Such performance evaluations may be conducted every three (3) years during the franchise term, and may done as part of any required survey.

§9-116.  Specific Additional Rules for MCS Providers Classified as Cable Operators
                (A) In addition to any requirements contained within this ordinance, all non-exempt MCS providers that are classified as cable operators shall be expected to abide by, and comply with, all applicable provisions of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984.

                (B) The specific provisions of the CCPA include, but are not limited to, the following:

   (1) cable channels for public, educational, or governmental use (Section 611 CCPA--codified at 47 USC 531);

   (2) cable channels for commercial use (Section 612--47 USC 532);

   (3) general franchise requirements (Section 621--47 USC 541);

   (4) franchise fees (Section 622--47 USC 542);

   (5) regulation of rates (Section 623--47 USC 543);

   (6) regulation of services, facilities, and equipment (Section 624--47 USC 544);

   (7) modification of franchise obligations (Section 625--47 USC 545);

   (8) franchise renewal (Section 626--47 USC 546);

   (9) conditions of sale of a franchise (Section 627--47 USC 547);

   (10) subscriber privacy (Section 631--47 USC 551); and

   (11) equal employment opportunity (Section 634--47 USC 554).

                (C) Further, as an additional requirement, before the second anniversary of the effective date of this ordinance, any non-exempt MCS provider classified as a cable operator and providing cable service within the City shall have designed, built and activated a multi-channel system with a channel capacity of at least sixty (60) channels.

                (D) Further, the Council/franchising authority is committed that the goal of the CCPA, as set forth in Section 601(4) of the Act (codified at 47 USC 521(4)), is met at all times. As a result, the Council/franchising authority expressly requires that upon the advent, implementation, and transmission of high definition television (HDTV), its functional equivalent, or any subsequently developed technological advancement affecting channel capacity or needed bandwidth for any video programming source or service, the cable operator shall not lessen, dilute, or decrease the mix, level, quality, or quantity of programming services carried on the cable system for reasons of lack of adequate channel capacity.

                (E) Additionally, the Council/franchising authority, in the interests of minimizing on-going operating costs to the cable operator and the resultant increases in rates and charges paid by subscribers is committed to the introduction of technological advancements that could realize such benefits to both the cable operator and subscriber. Therefore, unless an operator can demonstrate that it is both technologically and economically unfeasible, the affected cable operator shall within eighteen (18) months of the effective date of a franchise renewal agreement, or at the time of initial construction under a new franchise agreement, introduce addressable technology allowing cable service levels to be changed without the expense (either to the operator or subscriber) of a separate trip or call.

 

§9-117.  Specific Additional Public, Educational, and Governmental Rules for MCS Providers
Classified as Cable Operators
                (A) The Council/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 611 of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 531), the Council/franchising authority has certain power with respect to certain aspects for public, educational, or governmental (PEG) use that is provided by MCS providers classified as cable operators.

                (B) To the extent permitted by law, and in order to fulfill the Council/franchising authority's desired goal of a public, educational, and governmental (PEG) access policy that will facilitate the long-range needs of the City, the Council/franchising authority adopts the following:

   (1) At the time of an initial application for an MCS franchise for a cable system, and contained within any renewal franchise agreement, an MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall pledge to include the following guarantees:

   (a) An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at its own expense, one (1) twelve (12) hour educational channel; and

   (b) An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at its own expense, one (1) twelve hour (12) governmental channel that is available for providing coverage of Council meetings, and other related programming offered or designed by the City Manager, or designated official, including department heads; and

   (c) An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at its own expense, one (1) twelve (12) hour public access channel that is available for use by various community groups and organizations.

   (2) At such time as the Council/franchising authority determines the need for more channel time to exist on any given access channel, an MCS provider shall make any or all of the access channels available for more than twelve (12) hours per day upon thirty (30) days written notice.

   (3) Both the Council/franchising authority and the affected cable operator shall review use after every six (6) months, including the percentage of use of every PEG channel. At the end of each six (6) month period, the Council/franchising authority shall evaluate the response and actual use of such channels. If, after any six (6) month period, the percentage of use for any required PEG channel drops below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total time allocated, then the required number of hours shall be reduced to a number that most closely approximates the average hours of use per day. If the Council/franchising authority determines the average hours of use per day for any required PEG channel is less than one (1) hour, then the requirement for that channel's availability shall cease, and an affected cable operator may use such channel for any lawful purpose, unless and until the Council/franchising authority determines that need for the use of the channel again exists.

   (4) If, at any time, ninety percent (90%) of the total time allocated for any required PEG channel is consistently used five (5) days a week for a period of three (3) months, then the cable operator shall provide an additional PEG channel.

   (5) A cable operator shall provide mobile, portable, and stationary equipment to be used for PEG access, together with the aid of technical and production assistance provided by the cable operator. A cable operator shall provide equipment that can store programs for delayed cable-casting. There will be no cost for technical production assistance for PEG access use to any one user provided that such use does not exceed fifty (50) actual production man-hours. Moreover, the cost of maintenance of a PEG access studio, and equipment required to run the studio shall be borne by the cable operator.

  (6) The City Council/franchising authority may require a cable operator to provide live cable-casting of City Council meetings and School Board meetings, as the need may be determined by the respective bodies, and the operator shall comply with the request to do so within thirty (30) days of notification by the City Council/franchising authority.

 

§9-118.  The Council/Franchising Authority's Policy Regarding Local Production Facilities and 
Equipment
                (A) The Council/franchising authority recognizes the fact that certain needs of the City and the public regarding the transmission and receipt of information can be met by a local production facility. In order to meet those above-noted needs, the Council/franchising authority may require, after a public hearing, that any MCS provider:

   (1) provide and equip, a facility that will enable the City, the public, and non-profit organizations or agencies to produce and originate video and audio programming from a fixed studio location.

   (2) equip such facility so as to permit a complete and full array of production, editing, and program insertion capabilities and functions, as may be deemed necessary for maximizing the system's capabilities, taking into account the cost of such requirement.

   (3) activate the system in a bi-directional mode, so as to allow the live or taped insertion of programming from remote locations throughout the City for distribution to any and/or all locations within the City, in a time-frame determined by the City.

   (4) maintain and replace, as needed, any and all, production-related equipment provided or purchased by the operator in a timely manner, upon demonstration of the need for such and upon request by the City.

   (5) provide additional production-related equipment, from time-to-time, as may be deemed necessary for the City to fulfill its goal of maximizing the capabilities of a system in meeting identified community needs.

 

§9-119.  The Council/Franchising Authority's Objective With Respect to the Provision of Broad
Categories of Video Programming
                (A) The Council/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 624 of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 544), the legal power of local government is severely restricted in requiring and/or demanding that particular video programming or other services be provided to subscribers over the multi-channel system.

                (B) Nevertheless, the Council/franchising authority recognizes that it should strive to ensure that its citizens receive the widest, and most diverse selection of video programming possible. Consequently, for those MCS providers required to maintain a franchise, the Council/franchising authority states as its objective to such franchised MCS providers, that the provision of services and video programming categories to subscribers should include at least the following broad categories:

   (1) local broadcast stations;

   (2) two (2) distant carriage signals, or satellite fed broadcast stations;

   (3) PEG programming on the lowest offered and/or available tier;

   (4) sports programming services (regional and/or national);

   (5) news, information, or public affairs/interest programming services;

   (6) financial/consumer-oriented programming services;

   (7) scientific and/or cultural programming services;

   (8) children's programming services; and

   (9) ethnically sensitive programming services.

 

§9-120.  The Council/Franchising Authority's Policy Regarding the Provision of Seamless or "See-through" Technology
                (A) The Council/franchising authority recognizes the fact that it is in the public's interest to be able to utilize the functions inherent in subscriber receiving equipment, without having to incur additional costs to obtain the same functions. Consequently, the Council/franchising authority may require that:

   (1) unless an MCS provider can demonstrate to the City that it is technically or economically unfeasible or commercially impracticable, then such MCS provider shall provide the ability to utilize the functions inherent in subscriber equipment in a seamless or "see-through" manner which allows:

   (a) the use of any built-in remote control capability of a subscriber's television for the control of any, and all, television channels provided by the MCS provider without the use or necessity of additional equipment; and

   (b) the ability to record video programming on any channel provided by the MCS provider, while watching programming on any different channel, without the use or necessity of any additional in-home equipment other than the television receiver/monitor and a recorder.

§9-126.  Miscellaneous ProvisionsTampering and Unauthorized Reception of Certain Services
                (A) Consistent with Section 633 of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 553), no person shall intercept or receive, or assist in intercepting or receiving any communications service offered over a multi-channel system, unless specifically authorized to do so by an MCS provider, or as may otherwise be specifically authorized by law.

                (B) For the purpose of this Section, the term "assist in intercepting or receiving" shall include the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or distributor (as the case may be) for the unauthorized reception of multi-channel service as noted in subsection (A) of this Section.

                (C) Without securing permission from an MCS provider, or making payment to an MCS provider, then no person shall be authorized to make any connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any part of an authorized or franchised multi-channel system for the purpose of receiving or intercepting, or assisting others to receive or intercept any cable service provided lawfully by the MCS provider.

                (D) No person shall be authorized to willfully tamper with, remove, or damage any cable, wires, equipment, or facilities used for the distribution of multi-channel services.

                (E) Any, and all, MCS providers are encouraged to work with the Council/franchising authority in developing and implementing a plan designed to control and eliminate the unauthorized reception of certain cable services within the City.

§10-22.  Conveyances, Transfers, and Titles
                The city clerk is hereby authorized to convey lots in the city cemetery, by certificate, signed by the mayor and attested by the city clerk, specifying that the person to whom the same is issued is the owner of the lot or lots described therein by number as laid down on the plat adopted by the city council, for the purpose of interment of human bodies and the ashes of cremated human bodies, and such certificate shall vest in the purchaser, and purchaser's heirs or assigns, a right to such lot or lots, for the sole purpose of such interment, under the rules and regulations governing such cemetery, and for no other purpose. Transfers of such lots may be made by surrendering such certificate thereof to the city clerk, who shall cancel the same, and note such cancellation on the permanent cemetery records, and issue a new certificate to the assignee in lieu thereof. For each of such new certificates and services the clerk shall receive, for the use of the city a fee in accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule.

 

§10-23.  Lot Ownership; Restrictions

§10-24.  Abandonment
                The ownership or right in or to an unoccupied cemetery lot, part of a lot, lots, or parts of lots, in the city cemetery shall, upon abandonment, revert to the city. The continued failure to maintain or pay for the permanent care for a cemetery lot, part of a lot, lots, or parts of lots, in the city cemetery for a period of ten years shall create and establish a presumption that the same has been abandoned.

                Abandonment shall not be deemed complete unless, after such ten year period, there shall have been given by the city to the recorded owner, or if the owner be deceased or whereabouts unknown, to the heirs of such deceased person, notice declaring the lot, part of a lot, lots, or parts of lots to be abandoned. The notice may be served personally upon the owner or heirs or may be served by the mailing of the notice by registered or certified mail to the owner or heirs, as the case may be, to their last known address. In the event that the address of neither the owner nor the owner's heirs can be established, then notice of such abandonment shall be given by publishing the same one time in a legal newspaper published in and of general circulation in the county.

                If, within one year from the time of serving or publishing such notice, the record owner or heirs shall give notice in writing to the city that in fact there has been no such abandonment, then a presumption of abandonment shall no longer exist. In case abandonment has been complete as hereinbefore provided, the city may sell and convey title to any such abandoned lot, part of a lot, lots, or parts of lots. Any funds realized from the sale of such lot, part of a lot, lots, or parts of lots, shall be handled as provided by this chapter, and shall be accounted for accordingly.

 

§10-25.  Lots; Certificate of Ownership
                The prices of lots in the city cemetery shall be fixed by the city council, and a schedule of prices shall at all times be publicly exhibited in the city clerk's office giving the prices in full, and no certificate of ownership for any lot shall be issued until the price for each lot selected shall be paid in full to the city clerk. No change in such schedule of prices shall be made except upon a majority vote of the council.

 

§10-26.  Burial Spaces; Prices
                The prices for burial spaces in the city cemetery includes the price of permanent care. The city clerk is hereby ordered to collect amounts for such burial spaces in accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule.

                The fees for burial spaces set forth in the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule shall be waived, with title retained by the City, for any burial spaces designated by the cemetery superintendent for the burial of paupers by Hall County.

 

§10-27.  Fractional Lots; Prices
                Any fractional or partial lots in the city cemetery shall be sold at the same proportional price as full lots based upon the number of square feet contained in such fractional or partial lots.

 

§10-28.  Permanent Care
                Permanent care shall include the care of cemetery lots for all time to come, by providing maintenance found necessary in the judgment of the City to keep the lots in a neat and presentable condition. No lot, lots, or parts of lots shall be sold without payment for permanent care.

 

§10-29.  Permanent Care Fund
                Forty (40) percent of the amount collected for a burial space or spaces shall be deposited in the city cemetery permanent care fund.

                All twelve foot streets and alleys running from north to south and extending through the city cemetery grounds in Section 29 and Fractional Section 30 in Township 11 North, Range 9 West of the Sixth P.M., known as the "Old Cemetery," shall be vacated as driveways. Such streets and alleys, so vacated, shall hereafter be known as "A" lots, and shall be designated by the number of the lot lying east thereof, with the addition of the letter "A", thus, lot number "1A", and so on, and for pricing purposes shall be considered as half lots in size.

§15-67.  Waiver of Demand Charge
               For customers developing a new site or significantly expanding an existing facility, the Utilities Department may waive the charge on the incremental demand for the first twelve months of service. Customers developing a new site must have an anticipated load of at least 500 KW; these customers will have the entire demand charge waived for the twelve month period.

               An expansion must result in at least 300 KW additional load, based on largest historical Summer Demand at the facility. During the months from June through October, the demand charge in excess of this historical Summer Demand will be waived. During the months from November through May, the Billing Demand for the corresponding month of the previous year will be used as the Billing Demand.

               Customers applying for this waiver must remain on Rate 100 for at least twelve months after resumption of full demand billing. For the twelve months after resumption of full demand billing, the Summer Demand will reflect the waived demand. The Summer Demand for new customers will be not less than 500 KW. The Summer Demand for plant expansions will be not less than 300 KW above the historical Summer Demand.

               Written application for waiver of demand charge must be made prior to connection of such new load to the City electric system, and shall be subject to the approval of the Utilities Director.

The property owner shall have ten (10) days after the date of the notice to remove or paint over the graffiti, or the conditions will be subject to abatement by the city.

If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners:

(1) By personal service on the owner, occupant or person in charge or control of the property.

 NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required by law at your expense to remove or paint over the graffiti located on the property commonly known as: ____________________________, Grand Island, Nebraska, which is visible to public view, within ten (10) days after the date of this notice; or, if you fail to do so, City employees or private contractors employed by the City will enter upon your property and abate the public nuisance by removal or painting over the graffiti. The cost of the abatement by the City employees or its private contractors will be assessed upon your property and such costs will constitute a lien upon the land until paid.

                Invitation for Bids. An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. Invitations for bids on public works contracts shall require a statement of compliance with fair labor standards as required by Neb. R.R.S. 73-102.

                Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a reasonable time, not less than seven (7) calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids.

                Bid Opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids.

                Bid Acceptance and Bid Evaluation. Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this chapter. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids.

                Correction or Withdrawal of Bids; Cancellation of Awards. Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written or telegraphic notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the City or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if:

(A)  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or

(B)  The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the purchasing agent.

                Award.

R.R.S. 73-101.01 for resident bidder preference. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a construction project exceeds available funds as certified by the city treasurer, and such bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent, the purchasing agent is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. Negotiated adjustments shall be based upon eliminating independent deductive items specified in the invitation for bids or upon adjustments to unit prices or project prices.

                Multi-Step Sealed Bidding. When it is considered impractical to prepare initially a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.

                Local Bidder Preference. In case of tied low bids, all other things being equal, preference shall be given in the following order:

In conducting discussion, there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.

                Award.

If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the purchasing agent. The failure of a bidder or offeror to supply promptly information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility with respect to such bidder or offeror. A copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the nonresponsible bidder or offeror. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file and be made a public record.

                Right of Nondisclosure. Information furnished by a bidder or offeror pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed by the City outside of the office of the purchasing agent, or using agency, without prior written consent by the bidder or offeror.

(A)  The contract price is based on adequate price competition;
(B)  The contract price is based on established catalogue prices or market prices;
(C)  The contract price is set by law or regulation; or
(D)  It is determined in writing by the purchasing agent that the requirements of this section may be waived, and the determination states the reasons for such waiver.

                Required Submissions Relating to Change Orders or Contract Modifications. A contractor shall submit cost and/or pricing data prior to the pricing of any change order or contract modification, including adjustments to contracts awarded by competitive sealed bidding, whether or not cost or pricing data was required in connection with the initial pricing of the contract, when the change or modification involves aggregate increases or aggregate decreases in costs plus applicable profits that are expected to exceed $100,000.

(A)  Unrelated and separately priced adjustments for which cost or pricing data would not be required are consolidated for administrative convenience; or

(B)  It is determined in writing by the purchasing agent that the requirements of this section may be waived, and the determination states the reasons for such waiver.

                A cost analysis or a price analysis, as appropriate, may be conducted by the Purchasing Agent and using department prior to award of the contract other than one awarded under §27-8 (Competitive Sealed Bidding).

§27-18.  Bid And Performance Bonds
                Bid, payment, and performance bonds or other security may be requested for supply, service or construction contracts as the Purchasing Agent or head of a using department deems advisable to protect the City's interests, or required by law.

§27-19.  Types Of Contracts
                General Authority. Subject to the limitations of this section, any type of contract which is appropriate to the procurement and which will promote the best interests of the City may be used, provided that the use of a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract is prohibited. A cost reimbursement contract may be used only when a determination is made in writing, that such contract is likely to be less costly to the City than any other type or that it is impracticable to obtain the supply, service, or construction item required except under such a contract.

                Multi-Term Contracts.

        (A)  Specified Period. Unless otherwise provided by law, a contract for supplies or services may be entered into for any period of time deemed to be in the best interests of the City, provided, the term of the contract and conditions of renewal or extension, if any, are included in the solicitation and funds are available for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting. Payment and performance obligations, for succeeding fiscal periods shall be subject to the availability and appropriation of funds therefor.

        (B)  Determination Prior to Use. Prior to the utilization of a multi-term contract, it shall be determined in writing:

  (i)  That estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and are reasonably firm and continuing; and

  (ii)  That such a contract will serve the best interests of the City by encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting economics in City procurement.

        (C)  Cancellation Due to Unavailability of Funds in Succeeding Fiscal Periods. When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract shall be canceled and the contractor shall be reimbursed for the reasonable value of any non-recurring costs incurred but not amortized in the price of the supplies or services delivered under the contract. The cost of cancellation may be paid from any appropriations available for such purposes.

                Multiple Source Contracting.

        (A)  General. A multiple source award is an award of an indefinite quantity contract for one or more similar supplies or services to more than one bidder or offeror. The obligation to order the City's actual requirements is limited by the provision of Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-306(1).

        (B)  Limitations on Use. A multiple source award may be made when award to two or more bidders or offerors for similar products is necessary for adequate delivery, service, or product compatibility. Any multiple source award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of §27-8 (Competitive Sealed Bidding), §27-9 (Competitive Sealed Proposals), §27-11 (Small Purchases), and §27-13 (Emergency Procurements), as applicable. Multiple source awards shall not be made when a single award will meet the City's needs without sacrifice of economy or service. Awards shall not be made for the purpose of dividing the business, making available product or supplier selection to allow for user preference unrelated to utility or economy, or avoiding the resolution of tie bids. Any such awards shall be limited to the least number of suppliers necessary to meet the valid requirements.

        (C)  Contract and Solicitation Provisions. All eligible users of the contract shall be named in the solicitation, and it shall be mandatory that the actual requirements of such users that can be met under the contract be obtained in accordance with the contract, provided that:

  (i)  The City shall reserve the right to take bids separately if a particular quantity requirement arises which exceeds its normal requirement or an amount specified in the contract; and

  (ii)  The City shall reserve the right to take bids separately if the purchasing agent approves a finding that the supply or service available under the contract will not meet a nonrecurring special need of the City.

        (D)  Intent to Use. If a multiple source award is anticipated prior to issuing a solicitation, the City shall reserve the right to make such an award and the criteria for award shall be stated in the solicitation.

        (E)  Determination Required. The purchasing agent shall make a written determination setting forth the reason for a multiple source award, which shall be made a part of the procurement file.

Contracts for public works shall include a provision for the maintenance of fair labor standards as required in Neb. R.R.S. 73-102.

 

§27-21.  Contract Administration
                A contract administration system designed to insure that a contractor is performing in accordance with the solicitation under which the contract was awarded, and the terms and conditions of the contract, shall be established and maintained.

§27-27.  Specifications; Competition
                All specifications shall be drafted so as to promote overall economy for the purpose intended and encourage competition in satisfying the City's needs, and shall not be unduly restrictive. The policy enunciated in this section applies to all specifications including but not limited to, those prepared for the City by architects, engineers, designers, and draftsmen.

 

§27-28.  Specifications; Brand Name Or Equal
                Use. Brand name or equal specifications may be used when the purchasing agent determines in writing that any of the following circumstances exist:

(A)  No other design or performance specification or qualified products list is available;

(B)  Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase description, not including a brand name specification;

(C)  The nature of the product or the nature of the City's requirements makes use of a brand name or equal specification suitable for the procurement; or

(D)  Use of a brand name or equal specification is in the City's best interests.

Where a brand name or equal specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance, and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition.

 

§27-29.  Specifications; Brand Name
                Use. Since use of a brand name specification is restrictive of product competition, it may be used only when the purchasing agent makes a written determination that only the identified brand name item or items will satisfy the City's needs.

                Competition. The purchasing agent shall seek to identify sources from which the designated brand name item or items can be obtained and shall solicit such sources to achieve whatever degree of price competition is practicable. If only one source can supply the requirement, the procurement shall be made under §27-12 (Sole Source Procurement).

 

§27-30.  Construction Management
                The purchasing agent shall have discretion to select the appropriate method of construction contracting management for a particular project.

Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least 5% of the amount of the bid.

                Rejection of Bids for Noncompliance with Bid Security Requirements. When the invitation for bids requires security, noncompliance by a bidder requires that the bid be rejected unless it is determined that the bid fails to comply only in a nonsubstantial manner with the security requirements.

                Withdrawal of Bids. If a bidder is permitted to withdraw its bid before award as provided in §27-8 (Competitive Sealed Bidding), no action shall be had against the bidder or the bid security.

                Authority to Require Additional Bonds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the City to require a performance bond or other security in addition to those bonds, or in circumstances other than specified in this section.

                Suits on Payment Bonds; Right to Institute. Unless otherwise authorized by law, any person who has furnished labor or material to the contractor or subcontractors for the work provided in the contract, for which a payment bond is furnished under this section, and who has not been paid in full within 90 days from the date on which that person performed the last of the labor or supplied the material, shall have the right to sue on the payment bond for any amount unpaid at the time the suit is instituted and to prosecute the action for the amount due that person. However, any person having a contract with a subcontractor of the contractor, but no express or implied contract with the contractor furnishing the payment bond, shall have a right of action upon the payment bond upon giving written notice to the contractor within 90 days from the date on which that person performed the last of the labor or supplied the material.

The notice shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the contractor at any place the contractor maintains an office or conducts business.

                Suits on Payment Bonds; Where and When Brought. Unless otherwise authorized by law, every suit instituted upon a payment bond shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for the county or district in which the construction contract was to be performed.

 

§27-33.  Copies Of Bond Forms
                Any person may request and obtain from the City a certified copy of a bond upon payment of the cost of reproduction of the bond and postage, if any. A certified copy of a bond shall be prima facie evidence of the contents, execution, and delivery of the original.

 

§27-34.  Fiscal Responsibility
                Every contract modification, change order, or contract price adjustment under a construction contract with the City in excess of $300 shall be subject to prior written certification by the head of the department responsible for the project or the contract, or other official responsible for monitoring and reporting upon the status of the costs of the total project budget or contract budget, as to the effect of the contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price on the total project budget or the total contract budget. In the event that the certification discloses a resulting increase in the total project budget and/or the total contract budget, the purchasing agent shall not execute or make such contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price unless sufficient funds have been appropriated therefor, or the scope of the project or contract is adjusted so as to permit the degree of completion that is feasible within the total project budget and/or total contract budget as it existed prior to the contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price under consideration; provided, however, that with respect to the validity, as to the contractor, of any executed contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price which the contractor has reasonably relied upon, it shall be presumed that there has been compliance with the provisions of this section.

 

§27-35.  Architects; Engineers; Surveyors
                Public Announcement. It is the policy of the City to announce publicly all requirements for architects, engineers, and land surveying services and to negotiate such contracts on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications at fair and reasonable prices. In the procurement of architect, engineer, and land surveying services, the purchasing agent shall request firms to submit a statement of qualifications and performance data.

                Selection Process. A selection committee composed of the purchasing agent, the director of public works and the head of a using agency in need of the architect, engineer, or land surveying services shall conduct discussions with no less than three firms regarding the proposed contract and the relative utility of alternative methods of approach for furnishing the required services and shall select from among them no less than three of the firms deemed most qualified to provide the required services. The selection shall be made in order of preference, based on criteria established and published by the selection committee.

                Negotiation. The purchasing agent shall negotiate a contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified for architect, engineer, or land surveying services at compensation which the purchasing agent determines in writing to be fair and reasonable to the City. In making this decision, the purchasing agent shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity, and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the purchasing agent be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a price the purchasing agent determines to be fair and reasonable to the City, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The purchasing agent shall then undertake negotiations with the second most qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the purchasing agent shall formally terminate negotiations. The purchasing agent shall then undertake negotiations with the third most qualified firm. Should the purchasing agent be unable to negotiate a contract at a fair and reasonable price with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall select additional firms in order of their competence and qualifications, and the purchasing agent shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

 

§27-36.  Authority To Debar
                After reasonable notice to the person involved and reasonable opportunity for that person to be heard, the purchasing agent is authorized to debar a person for cause from consideration for award of contracts. The debarment shall be for a period of not more than three years. The purchasing agent is authorized to suspend a person from consideration for award of contracts if there is probable cause to believe that the person has engaged in any activity which might lead to debarment. The suspension shall be for a period not to exceed three months. The causes for debarment include:

(A)  Conviction for commission of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract, or in the performance of such contract or subcontract;

(B)  Conviction under state or federal statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property, or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty which currently, seriously, and directly affects responsibility as a City contractor;

(C)  Conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out of the submission of bids or proposals;

(D)  Violation of contract provisions, as set forth below, of a character which is regarded by the purchasing agent to be so serious as to justify debarment action:

I.  Deliberate failure without good cause to perform in accordance with the specifications or within the time limit provided in the contract; or

II.  A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts; provided that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment.

(E)  Any other cause the purchasing agent determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility as a City contractor, including debarment by another governmental entity for any cause listed in this chapter; or

In the event no special monitoring facility has been installed, the sampling shall be done at the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewers to the point at which the building lateral sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effects of waste constituents upon the wastewater treatment works and to determine the existence of possible hazards to life, limb and property.

 

§30-66.  Special Contracts or Agreements 
                No statement contained in these rules and regulations shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any person whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Department for transport and/or treatment, subject to applicable fees or payments.

 

§30-67.  Excessive Pollutant Penalty 
                               If a person discharges amounts of permissible pollutants in excess of the amounts permitted in the discharge permit, as stated in §30-71, a charge for Excessive Pollutant Penalty in accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule, per day of violation shall be imposed and paid by the person discharging wastes in violation of the permit.

 

§30-68.  Indemnity 
                In the event a person does discharge excessive amounts of pollutants in violation of the discharge permit, said person shall agree to indemnify and hold the City harmless against and from any and all loss, damage, claims, demands, actions, causes of action, penalties, judgments, costs, and expenses of whatsoever nature which may result from injury to or death of persons whomsoever, or from loss or destruction of or damage to property whatsoever, or results in the City being in violation of state or federal regulatory agency requirements, when such violation, injury, death, loss, destruction, or damage arises in any way in connection with or incident to a person depositing amounts of industrial waste in excess of those permitted in the discharge permit into the City's sanitary sewers. It must be proved, on an individual case basis, that a person's depositing of excessive amounts of pollutants, on a daily basis, was in fact the cause of a violation, injury, death, loss, destruction, or damage, and that the excessive discharge was not due to force majeure.

 

§30-69.  Charges to Major Industries 
                Each major contributing industry shall be assessed a monthly charge that reflects the City's cost of owning, operating, and maintaining the facilities used to serve these customers. The monthly charges shall be determined from time to time based upon analysis of the costs of capital and operation and maintenance costs associated with the facilities used to provide service.

 

Article IX. Industrial Waste Surcharge

 

§30-70.  When Surcharge Is Applicable 
                An industrial waste surcharge shall be assessed against any person discharging industrial wastes into the City's sanitary sewer system where the contributed waste strength exceeds that of "Normal Strength Wastewater" as defined in §30-1. Persons subject to the industrial waste surcharge shall be subject to the regular sewer user charges.

 

§30-71.  Pollutants Subject to Surcharge 
               The monthly amount of pollutants subject to the surcharge will be based on the average loading per plant operating day, times the number of operating days in the month the limits are exceeded. The pollutants limits that shall be subject to a surcharge are as follows:

BOD.........250 mg/L

Suspended Solids or TSS.........250 mg/L

Fats, Oils, and Grease...........100 mg/L

Total Nitrogen  (Organic & Inorganic).......25 mg/L

Hydrogen Sulfide......0 mg/L

pH..less than 6 S.U.

pH.greater than 9 S.U.

 

§30-72.  Amount of Surcharge 
                The industrial waste surcharge to be assessed each month will be determined by application of the rates then in effect.

                The surcharge amount shall be determined by calculating the average number of pollutant pounds per operating day based on the average of periodic grab or composite samples obtained and tested as described in §30-63.

                In computing the surcharge amount, no credit will be allowed because a pollutant strength is less than that allowed in "Normal Strength Wastewater."

 

§30-73.  Review of Surcharge Rates 
                The director shall review the surcharge rates each August and adjust them, if necessary, to reflect the actual cost to treat the pollutants subject to the surcharge.

 

§30-74.  Monitoring Facilities 
                When a person discharges a waste that is subject to the industrial waste surcharge, the director may require monitoring facilities be provided. The installation and use of the monitoring facilities shall be in compliance with §30-60 and §30-63.

 

§30-75.  Surcharge for Class Groups 
                The director may classify certain commercial and industrial establishments which routinely discharge BOD and suspended solids concentrations exceeding those established for "Normal Strength Wastewater," into the following classes:

(1) Eating Places: Includes restaurants, bars, lounges, and other establishments which engage in the preparation of food or beverage which is served directly to the consumer.

(2) Food and Kindred Products Processing: Includes commercial establishments which engage in the preparation, packaging, processing, or distribution of food, food products, grains, or produce, and which discharge less than 200,000 gallons of wastes per month.

(3) Equipment Service Facilities: Includes establishments which perform washing, cleaning, or servicing of automobiles, trucks, buses, machinery, or equipment; this class to include public facilities, facilities limited to specific companies, and attended or coin-operated establishments.

                The director shall assess an industrial waste surcharge for each class based on waste strength determinations established by averaging grab or composite samples or both, taken from a representative number of establishments in each class and shall apply this surcharge to the water consumption or metered wastewater of the establishment. If the establishment is within a larger facility for which water usage is determined from a master meter, the director shall determine an estimated volume for the establishment on which the surcharge is applied. The director shall then add the appropriate industrial surcharge to billings for regular water and sanitary sewer service for each establishment included in one of the classes.

                If an establishment contains operations from more than one of the classes, and the director determines that the surcharge for a particular class would not adequately compensate the City for its cost of treatment, the director may assess a surcharge based on a proportional average of the class surcharges involved, or may require the establishment to be billed under the requirements of §30-70.

                The owner of an establishment classified into one of the classes may elect to have the industrial surcharge billed under §30-70 rather than this section, by making application to the director and paying the required sampling costs.

                The director may revise the class surcharges in the future to reflect a change in the average strength of the wastes discharged or to reflect a change in the costs to treat these wastes.

 

§30-76.  Contract for Reserved Capacity 
                The director may, with the approval of the council, enter into a contract with persons discharging industrial wastes who desire to reserve a portion of the design capacity of the sanitary sewer system or water pollution control plant. The contract shall contain a provision stating that an annual amount, representing the person's proportionate share of the City's net annual capital investment cost in the facilities reserved, shall be paid by the person signing the contract. The contract shall also contain a provision that if the person's average daily flow varies more than 20 percent on a yearly basis, either party may open the contract for renegotiation of the minimum payment.

§30-80.  Rental Charge; Computation 
                For the use of the city sewer system, each consumer shall pay a rental charge which shall be computed and based on his contribution of sewage to such system; provided, that a minimum charge for sewer rental as set forth in §30-84 and §30-85 shall be made for each dwelling unit which is directly or indirectly connected to the City sanitary sewer system, unless for a complete billing period the City water supply to such unit has been disconnected by the City, or the private water supply disconnected to the satisfaction of the City. For the purposes of this Article, a dwelling unit shall mean one or more rooms and a single kitchen designed as a unit for occupancy by one family for living and sleeping purposes, and shall include a manufactured home. If more than one dwelling unit is served from a single water meter or single private water source as in the case of apartments and mobile home courts, a percentage of the minimum rate shall be charged against each unit, depending on the number of dwelling units per water meter or private water source as follows:

2 to 5 dwelling units........................................................................... 65%
6 to 10 dwelling units......................................................................... 60%
11 to 20 dwelling units....................................................................... 55%
21 and over dwelling units................................................................ 50%

The above charges shall be computed upon the yearly average of the number of dwelling units occupied.

 

§30-81.  Rental; Residential and Commercial

                The charges to be paid by residential consumers for use of the sewerage system and disposal plant shall be based upon water consumption.  The monthly residential sewer charges for the twelve months following April 1st of each year will be based on the average water consumption for that property during the months of January, February and March.  Commercial customers shall pay according to the meter reading which precedes billing.

§30-82.  Rental Charge; Use of Water Meters 
                The sewer rental charge shall be applied separately to each individual water meter which measures water contributing to or discharging into the city sewerage system and shall be determined by the water meter reading for water furnished by the water works system of the city or by privately-owned water supply which may contribute to or discharge into the sewerage system. In the case of unmetered water supply, the quantity of water used and discharged into the sewerage system of the City shall be determined to the satisfaction of the council and at the expense of the owner of the unmetered water supply. If the quantity of unmetered water discharged into the sewerage system is estimated by the council to be in excess of one thousand cubic feet per month for any one month, the council may require that such water supply be metered at the expense of the owner or consumer.

                Should any meter get out of order or repair and fail to register properly, such consumer will be charged at the average monthly consumption as shown by the meter when in order for six months previous, or fraction thereof, if the same has not been used that long.

 

§30-83.  Volume Charges

               Sidewalks built within one foot or less of property lines shall be known as "conventional" sidewalks. Conventional sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide. Only conventional sidewalks may be constructed on arterial, collector, and other protected streets, except as hereinafter provided.

               Sidewalks constructed immediately adjacent to any curb and gutter shall be known as "curb" sidewalks. Curb sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide. No curb sidewalk may be constructed unless curb and gutter is constructed immediately prior to or is in place at the time of the sidewalk construction.

               No curb sidewalks may be constructed unless there is constructed a continuous curb sidewalk between successive streets or between a street and an alley. The intent of this section is to provide for uniform sidewalk construction between successive streets or streets and alleys. In some instances, intersections or alleys are not in existence in newly platted areas, or blocks in earlier platted areas are excessive in length, in which case curb sidewalk may be constructed only if it will be continuous for approximately one block and there remains a continuous distance of the same length for construction of conventional sidewalk. For the purpose of this section, one block is defined as 300 feet, more or less. The purpose of this requirement is to provide for continuous sidewalk, either curb or conventional, for a reasonable distance without change. No conventional sidewalk may be replaced with curb sidewalk without special permission from the Public Works Director.

               Where buildings, improved parking lots, or other improvements extend to the property line, the sidewalk must be at least five feet in width and extend to the property line.

               In areas classified as rural routes by the U.S. Postal Service, properties will be allowed curb sidewalk only if the following conditions exist:

(1) If curb exists or is being constructed immediately prior to installation of the sidewalk; and

(2) If all property owners installing curb sidewalk agree to neighborhood box units which are approved and installed by the U.S. Postal Service; and

(3) If the section of sidewalk will be consistent between successive streets or from a street to an alley.

§32-56.  Specifications
               The public works director shall determine and provide specifications for the surfaced driveways as nearly uniform as possible throughout the City, and, in determining such specifications, shall consider the mixture of materials, forming, thickness, handling, finishing, expansion joints, foundations, compaction, and any other items or phases for the highest durability of the completed structure, and for safety, convenience, and general utility. Special consideration shall be given to design for vehicle crossings and driveways.

 

§32-57.  Costs at and Within Intersections
               The owners of corner lots at the intersections of streets shall be responsible for the cost of construction of the extensions of public sidewalks to the adjacent curb lines, and, in case of curb sidewalk construction, shall be responsible for the cost of all such sidewalks laid within the street intersection area.

 

§32-58.  Sidewalks; Assessments; Bonds
               (1)  Petition Method of Sidewalk Construction. Upon the petition of any freeholder who desires to build such a permanent sidewalk, the council may by ordinance order the same to be built, and that the cost of the same until paid shall be a perpetual lien upon the real estate along which the freeholder desires such sidewalk to be constructed, and the City may assess and levy the costs of same against such real estate in the manner provided by law.

Each of such installments, except the first, shall draw interest at the rate of not exceeding seven percent per annum from the time of the levy aforesaid until the same shall become delinquent; and after the same shall become delinquent interest at the rate of three-fourths of one percent per month shall be paid thereon as in the case of other special taxes. The council shall pay for the building of such permanent sidewalk out of the general fund.

               (2)  Sidewalks; Failure to Improve.

                        (A) Whenever it shall be determined by a three-fourths vote of the city council that  public sidewalks are not in place contiguous to the street side boundary lines of any lot, tract, or parcel of land within the city, or that any sidewalks then in place are of insufficient width for usual and convenient use by the public, or that any sidewalks are not laid upon property grade and line, or are of defective construction, or are in a state of disrepair, or are obstructed so as to make such sidewalks unsafe, dangerous or hazardous for public use, then the Public Works Department shall send notice to the property owner giving 15 days to obtain a permit and an additional 15 days to construct or repair the sidewalk as required. Notice will be sent by regular United States mail to the owners last known address.

                        (B) In case the owner or owners of any lot, lots or lands abutting on any street or avenue, or part thereof, shall fail to construct or repair any sidewalk in front of his, her or their lot, lots or lands within the time and in the manner as directed and required by the mayor and council, after having received due notice to do so, they shall be liable for all damages or injury occasioned by reason of the defective or dangerous condition of any sidewalk; and the mayor and council shall have power to cause such sidewalk to be constructed or repaired and assess the cost thereof against such property in the manner provide by law for the levying and collection of special assessments.

                        (C) In addition to the foregoing, the Council by a three-fourths vote of all members may, by ordinance, create a sidewalk district pursuant to §19-2417, R.R.S. Neb., and cause such sidewalk to be constructed, reconstructed, or repaired as the case may be and shall contract thereof. The council shall levy assessments on the lots and parcels of land abutting on or adjacent to the sidewalk improvements especially benefited thereby in such district in proportion to the benefits, to pay the cost of such improvement. All assessments shall be a lien on the property on which levied from the date of the levy until paid. The assessment of the special tax, for the sidewalk improvement, shall be levied at one time and shall become delinquent as follows: One-seventh of the total assessment shall become delinquent in ten days after such levy; one-seventh in one year; one-seventh in two years; one-seventh in three years; one-seventh in four years; one-seventh in five years; and one-seventh in six years. Each of such installments, except the first, shall draw interest at the rate of not exceeding seven percent per annum from the time of the levy until the same shall become delinquent; and after the same shall become delinquent, interest at the rate of fourteen percent per annum shall be paid thereon as in the case of other special taxes. All such assessments shall be made and collected in accordance with the procedure established for paving assessments. The power to establish a sidewalk district shall be cumulative to the general authority of the City to regulate sidewalks.

               (3) Bonds, Warrants, Payments. For the purpose of paying the cost of sidewalk improvements in any sidewalk district, the council may, by ordinance, cause to be issued bonds of the City, to be called Sidewalk Bonds of District No. , payable in not exceeding six years from date, and to bear interest annually or semi-annually at not exceeding six percent per annum, with interest coupons attached. Such bonds shall be general obligations of the City with principal and interest payable from a fund made up of the special assessments collected and supplemented by transfers from the general fund to make up any deficiency in the collection of the special assessments. For the purpose of making partial payments as the work progresses, warrants may be issued by the council, upon certificate of the engineer in charge showing the amount of the work completed, in a sum not exceeding eighty percent of the cost thereof, which warrants shall be redeemed and paid upon the sale of the bonds issued and sold as aforesaid.

               (4) Waiver of Sidewalk Requirements. This section shall be of no force or effect with respect to any property subject to a waiver of sidewalk requirements granted by the city council as provided by this Code.

                It shall be the duty of any owner or occupant of lots or lands to keep the adjacent sidewalks clean and free from obstructions and accumulations of snow, ice, mud, and slush. If such owner or occupant shall fail in this duty after notice, the City may by contract or through its own employees, clean such sidewalks and free them from obstructions and accumulations of snow, ice, mud, and slush. The cost of such service shall constitute an assessment and tax upon the real estate adjacent to the sidewalks involved and shall remain a lien on the real estate which may be foreclosed by the City in the manner provided by law for other liens or assessments, with the priority of other taxes.

               Any person who is injured by the failure or neglect of the owner and occupant of real estate to comply with this provision may have a cause of action for damages against such owner and occupant.

Lots in residential zoning districts shall have a sight-obscuring fence, foliage, or other screening material adjacent to such thoroughfare. The sight-obscuring fence shall not be metal strips or slats in a chain link fence.

        (b) If the highway is not a non-access or controlled access thoroughfare, one of the following methods of development shall be required:

(i) Either method required for a non-access or controlled access thoroughfare may be applied; or

(ii) Lots may have frontage directly on such thoroughfare, provided, that the minimum setback for any new building in any zoning district shall be thirty feet, and shall be landscaped except for approved driveways.

               (5)  Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, or where it is found to be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when adjoining property is subdivided.

               (6)  Under normal conditions streets shall be laid out as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify variations. More than four approaches to any intersection shall be prohibited. Street jogs at intersections with centerline offsets of less than 75 feet should be avoided.

               (7)  Alleys may be provided in commercial and industrial districts. Alleys shall be avoided in residential districts except to extend existing alleys to a street.

§33-13.  Blocks
               (1)  Block Length: Intersecting streets determining block lengths shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets and customary subdivision practice in the immediate area. Blocks shorter than 450 feet and longer than 1200 feet in residential districts should be avoided.

               (2)  Block Width. The width of a block shall be sufficient to allow for two tiers of lots with utility easement, if required. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as may be best suited for the contemplated use of the property taking into consideration the probable arrangement of parking and truck loading and maneuvering upon the property.

               (3)  Very Large Lots and Blocks. When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels, such lots or parcels should be so arranged as to permit the logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for adequate utility connections for such resubdivision. Easements for the future openings and extension of such streets may, at the direction of the Planning Commission, be made a requirement of the plat.

 

§33-14.  Lots
               (1)  Minimum Dimensions: The minimum width of lots shall be as required by the Zoning Chapter of the Grand Island City Code. Side lot lines should be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. Lots having a depth of less than 100 feet should be avoided. Lot sizes shall meet or exceed the requirement of the Zoning Chapter and should as near as practical meet or exceed the typical lot size for building sites in the immediate vicinity. Each lot shall be a buildable site after taking into account all yard spaces required by the Zoning Chapter. Excessive lot depth in relation to width should be avoided.

               (2)  Corner Lots Wider: Corner lots in residential areas shall be of sufficient size to comply with the requirements of the Zoning Chapter.

               (3)  Double Frontage: Lots with street frontage at both front and rear shall be avoided except when backing on a controlled access thoroughfare.

               (4)  Street Frontage: Each lot shall have frontage (minimum width of twenty (20) feet) on a street that will allow for practical, physical vehicular ingress/egress, and allow for the proper provision of present or future municipal services to the lot.

               (5)  Reversed Frontages and Key Lots: Reversed frontages at cross street intersections should be avoided except where it will match existing development. Key lots, being those inside lots fronting on side streets, should be avoided except where they are matching existing development and other lots are excessively deep. Key lots shall be prohibited where they disrupt utility or drainage easements. Reverse frontage and normal corner lots when adjacent to a key lot shall have additional width to allow front yard setbacks on both streets.

               (6)  Septic Tanks: In subdivisions within city jurisdiction outside of corporate limits where buildings are to be served by septic tanks, the size of lots shall be sufficiently large to accommodate adequate drainage fields. Standards set forth by the appropriate County and State or other agencies shall be met.

               (7)  Flag Lots: Flag lots, being those lots landlocked from public right-of-way except for a narrow tract of land of less width than minimum frontage as required by the Zoning Chapter should be discouraged except where development cannot reasonably be accomplished without their use. When such lots are platted, it shall be a requirement of the developer, builder, and owner to direct and maintain storm water drainage from the flag lot to the public right-of-way without directing the flow to adjoining property, i.e., drainage shall be by means of that strip of land connecting the area of the structure to the public right-of-way unless other drainage facilities are approved by the public works director.

Amended by Ord. No. 8921, effective 7-28-2004

 

§33-15.  Easements
               (1)  Utility Easements: Unless otherwise required by the director of Planning, the director of utilities operations, or the public works director, utilities easements shall be 20 feet wide, falling half on adjoining lots along rear lot lines, and where necessary the same shall apply to side lot lines. The full width of an easement may fall on one lot. They shall be planned for easy and continuous access for maintenance, shall be continuous through the block and shall connect as nearly in line as possible with adjoining easements. To facilitate the use of easements, rear lot lines in curvilinear platting shall form straight lines for as long a distance as feasible. Direction changes shall fall so that a side lot line will intersect the point of change so as to allow the guywire easements to be located on lot lines.

               (2)  Drainage Easements: Drainage easements for storm sewers or open channels shall be required where storm drainage cannot be practically carried under streets or in the right-of-way. Open channel drainage easements shall be required where there is evidence that the natural drainage for a large area traverses the subdivision. Drainage easements shall be sufficient in width so that motorized equipment may be used in their maintenance.

 

§33-16.  Pedestrian Ways
               Pedestrian ways may be required so as to allow cross access for pedestrians in very long blocks. In general, blocks of 800 feet or more in length may have a requirement for a pedestrian way near the center of the block and shall have a minimum width of six feet. Pedestrian ways shall have a sidewalk width of four feet and have a minimum 42 inch high chain link fence on both sides.

 

§33-17.  Reserve Strips of Land
               Reserve strips of land controlling access to or egress from their property, or from any other street or alley, shall not be permitted within any subdivided area.

 

§33-18.  School, Park, or Open Space Sites
               The Planning Commission may require the subdivider to reserve for purchase-option certain parcels of land for public use. The public agency shall have from the time of submission of the preliminary study to the submission of the final plat to exercise the purchase-option under this provision. The exact location of the reserved area shall be subject to approval of the Planning Commission.

 

 

Article V. Minimum Improvements
 

§33-19.  Minimum Improvements
               Inasmuch as the primary purpose of subdividing land is to create building sites, and inasmuch as vehicular access and certain utilities are essential to urban development, it shall be the responsibility of the developer to install in accordance with plans, specifications, and data approved by the public works director, certain required improvements as follows:

               (1)  Staking: The following described monuments shall be installed before the public works director shall approve the plat, or in lieu thereof, a performance bond in an amount equal to the cost of doing such work shall be furnished to the City of Grand Island before the public works director shall certify to the council that the required improvements have been satisfactorily arranged.

(a) The external boundaries, corners of blocks and lots, all points of curvature, and points of tangency, shall be monumented by an iron rod or pipe not less than 1/2 inch outside diameter and extending at least 24 inches below grade.

               (2)  Grading of Lots: When any building site is filled to a depth in excess of five feet, said fill shall be laid down in six-inch layers, and each layer shall be given six passes with a sheepsfoot roller with optimum moisture present for compaction to equal the bearing strength of the natural ground, indicated by Proctor test or other test which may be approved by the public works director.

               (3)  Storm Drainage shall be conveyed to an approved storm drainage system if available and adequate to accept the runoff from the fully developed subdivision. Available shall mean a system approved by the public works director to serve the proposed subdivision. If an approved system is available but not of adequate capacity, then provisions must be made for on-site detention to reduce the peak flow out of the subdivision to that which the approved system can accommodate. The detention cell shall be sized to accommodate a ten-year design storm as per criteria acceptable to the public works director. In computing cell capacity only the capacity above the elevation at which approved positive drainage exists will be considered. Detention cells without approved positive drainage will not be accepted. Determination of the approved form of positive drainage shall be made by the public works director. Gravity drainage shall be used if possible. Provisions shall be made for surface water traversing the subdivision. The subdivision agreement shall prohibit filling in of ditches or other drainage facilities and specify ownership and maintenance responsibility of detention cells and other drainage features not dedicated to the public.

               (4)  Sanitary Sewer shall be provided to connect all lots in the subdivision in accordance with standard specifications of the City of Grand Island to an approved public system if available and adequate to accept the flow from the fully developed subdivision.

                (B) A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection may include less than three (3) alternative sites so long as the applicant provides a factually detailed written rationale for why it could not identify at least three (3) potentially available, higher ranked, alternative sites.

                (C) For purposes of disqualifying potential collocations or alternative sites for the failure to meet the applicants service coverage or capacity objectives the applicant will provide (a) a description of its objective, whether it be to address a deficiency in coverage or capacity; (b) detailed  maps or other exhibits with clear and concise Radio Frequency (RF) data to illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative (whether it be collocation or a more preferred location); and (c) a description of why the alternative (collocation or a more preferred location) does not meet the objective.

 

§34-81.  Antenna Arrays

Antenna arrays are permitted in any zoning district as long as they are located upon an existing structure, excluding single family and duplex properties, that provides sufficient elevation for the arrays operation without the necessity of constructing a tower or other apparatus to extend the antenna array more than ten feet (10) above the structure.  Installation on City property requires the execution of necessary agreements. 

 

§34-82.  Accessory Uses, Equipment, Design, and Standards

(A) Accessory Uses.

  (1) Accessory uses shall be limited to such structures and equipment that are necessary for transmission or reception functions, and shall not include broadcast studios, offices, vehicles or equipment storage, or other uses not essential to the transmission or reception functions.

  (2) All accessory buildings shall be constructed of building materials equal to or better than those of the primary building on the site and shall be subject to applicable permits.

(B) Accessory Equipment.  All accessory equipment located at the base of a WCF shall be located or placed (at the applicants choice) in an existing building, underground, or in an equipment shelter or cabinet that is (1) designed to blend in with existing surroundings, using architecturally compatible construction and colors; and (2) be located so as to be unobtrusive as possible consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF.

(C) Site Design Flexibility.  Individual WCF sites vary in the location of adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography and other local variables. By mandating certain design standards, there may result a project that could have been less intrusive if the location of the various elements of the project could have been placed in more appropriate locations within a given site. Therefore, the WCF and supporting equipment may be installed so as to best camouflage, disguise them, or conceal them, to make the WCF more closely compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure, upon approval by the City.

(D) General Standards  

                  (1)  Landscaping and Screening:  Equipment shelters and cabinets and other on the ground ancillary equipment shall be screened with landscaping (except for those in the right-of-way) as required for the district in which they are located or with another design acceptable to the City. Alternatively, where technically feasible, the applicant shall incorporate the cabinet and other equipment into the base of a new pole (for example, for a small wireless facility) provided there is adequate space in the right-of-way and that ADA sidewalk accessibility requirements can be met.  All provisions of the ADA (including, but not limited to, clear space requirements) shall be met by the applicant.

  (2)  New Poles:  To the extent technically feasible, new poles must be designed to match the existing light fixtures and other poles, and they shall serve a dual purpose (for example, a new light fixture, flag pole or banner clips).

        (E) Radio Frequency (RF) Emissions Compliance Report.  A written report will be prepared, signed and sealed by a Nebraska-licensed professional engineer which assesses whether the proposed WCF demonstrates compliance with the RF emissions limits established by the FCC.  In no event shall any small wireless facilities, either individually or collectively with those of others, exceed the maximum permissible RF emission standards of the FCC.  In the event the FCCs maximum permissible RF standards are exceeded, the wireless provider shall immediately cease and desist the use of its equipment and facilities. 

 

§34-83.  Independent Technical and Legal Review

                Although the City intends for City staff to review applications to the extent feasible, the City may retain the services of an independent technical expert and attorney of its choice to provide evaluations of permit applications for WCFs.  The consultant shall have verifiable experience in the field of wireless communication facilities.  The consultants review may include, but is not limited to (a) the accuracy and completeness of the items submitted with the application; (b) the applicability of analysis and techniques and methodologies proposed by the applicant; (c) the validity of conclusions reached by the applicant; and (d) whether the proposed WCF complies with the applicable approval criteria set forth in this Article.  The applicant shall pay the reasonable cost for any independent consultant fees through a deposit, estimated by the City, within ten (10) days of the Citys request.  When the City requests such payment, the application shall be deemed incomplete for purposes of application processing timelines until the deposit is received.  In the event that such costs and fees do not exceed the deposit amount, the City shall refund any unused portion within thirty (30) days after the final permit is released or, if no final permit is released, within thirty (30) days after the City receives a written request from the applicant.  If the costs and fees exceed the deposit amount, then the applicant shall pay the difference to the City before the permit is issued.  The consultant shall provide an itemized description of the services and related fees and charges.

 

§34-84.  Indemnification

Each permit issued for a WCF located on City property shall be deemed to have as a condition of the permit a requirement that the applicant, registrant and wireless provider defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City and its officers, agents, employees, volunteers, and contractors from any and all liability, damages, or charges (including attorneys fees and expenses) arising out of claims, suits, demands, actions or causes of action as a result of the permit process, a granted permit, construction, erection, location, performance, operation, maintenance, repair, installation, replacement, removal, or restoration of the WCF.

Article VI. Groundwater Control Area No. 1

 

§35-60.  Purpose
                The United States Environmental Protection Agency issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the Cleburn Street Well Superfund Site on June 7, 1996, which identified three sources of subsurface soil and groundwater contamination.  These sources included the former One Hour Martinizing facility, Liberty Cleaners and Shirt Launderers, and Ideal Cleaners.  The former Nebraska Solvent Company was identified as a possible fourth contamination source subject to subsequent evaluation and testing.  The ROD described selected remedies for the three source areas, an element of which required the City of Grand Island to enact and enforce institutional control ordinances designating a Groundwater Control Area No. 1 in which groundwater use would be restricted to prevent human exposure and consumption of potentially contaminated groundwater, requiring registration of existing wells and requiring approval and registration of new wells.  The institutional control ordinances are to remain in full force and effect until the groundwater contamination identified in the ROD is reduced to a level making the groundwater safe to be used as a source of drinking water pursuant to 42 USC §300g, et seq., the Safe Drinking Water Act, or its successor legislation.

 

§35-61.  Definitions
As used in this Article, the following terms mean:

Groundwater means water pumped from a well located within the Groundwater Control Area No. 1 described in  Section 35-62.

Groundwater Contamination means the chemicals of concern (COC) described in the United States Environmental Protection Agency Record of Decision (ROD) for the Cleburn Street Well Superfund Site dated June 7, 1996, which was received and accepted by the Mayor and City Council pursuant to Resolution 98-28.

Groundwater Control Area No. 1 means a defined area within the corporate limits of the City of Grand Island subject to the institutional controls provided in this Article which are intended to prohibit human consumption of potentially contaminated groundwater from wells.

Well means a hole or shaft sunk into the earth in order to obtain water from a natural subterranean supply or aquifer.

The definitions found in Neb. Rev. Stat., Chapter 46 - Irrigation and Regulation of Water are adopted by reference, except where such definitions are in conflict with those provided in this section above.

 

§35-62.  Groundwater Control Area Boundaries
                The outer boundaries of the Groundwater Control Area No. 1 are described as follows:  Commencing at the southeasterly corner of the intersection of 9th Street and Adams Street; thence running northeasterly along the south boundary of 9th Street to the southwesterly corner of the intersection of 9th Street and Sycamore Street; thence running southeasterly along the west boundary of Sycamore Street to the northwesterly corner of the intersection of Sycamore Street and 1st Street; thence running southwesterly along the north boundary of 1st Street to the northwesterly corner of the intersection of 1st Street and Locust Street; thence running southerly along the west boundary of Locust Street to the intersection of Locust Street and Division Street; thence running southwesterly along the north boundary of Division Street to the northeasterly corner of the intersection of Division Street and Adams Street; thence running northwesterly along the east boundary of Adams Street to the point of beginning.

Article VII. Groundwater Control Area No. 2

 

§35-74.  Purpose
                The U.S. Army, in consultation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ), issued a Record of Decision and Record of Decision Amendment (collectively ROD) for the former Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant (CHAAP) which identified soil and groundwater contamination consisting of explosives above the USEPA Health Advisory Levels. The revised proposed plan for OU1 ROD Amendment identifies the Preferred Remedial Alternative for remediating groundwater at Operable Unit One (OU1) of CHAAP and provides the rational for the OU1 ROD Amendment. The preferred remedial alternatives include remedies for the on-post and off-post groundwater plume containing explosives. The on-post explosives plume will be treated to remedial action objectives using existing extraction and treatment technologies.  The On-Post Plume Institutional Controls will include land use restrictions, enforcement of the Hall County Reuse Plan for agricultural and industrial zoning on CHAAP and prohibiting water supply well drilling in the plume area. The Health Advisory Level in effect as of March 1, 2001, is 2ug/1 (microgram per liter) or 2 ppb (parts per billion).

                Pending natural attenuation obtaining the remedial action objectives of the ROD, the U.S. Army has requested that the City of Grand Island enact and enforce an ordinance instituting Off-Post Plume Institutional Controls by designating a groundwater control area in which groundwater use would be restricted to prevent human exposure and consumption of potentially contaminated groundwater, requiring registration of existing wells, prohibiting installation of new wells supplying water for human consumption in the plume area, and requiring approval and registration of new wells.  The Institutional Control Ordinance is to remain in full force and effect until the explosive contamination identified in the ROD is attenuated to less than USEPA Health Advisory Levels.

 

§35-75.  Definitions
As used in this Article, the following terms mean:

                Groundwater means water pumped from a well located within Groundwater Control Area No. 2 described in Section 35-72.

                Groundwater Contamination means the explosives described in the U.S. Army Record of Decision and Record of Decision Amendment (ROD) for the former Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant (CHAAP).

                Groundwater Control Area No. 2 means a defined area within the corporate limits and zoning jurisdiction of the City of Grand Island subject to the Off-Post Plume Institutional Controls provided in this Article.

                Off-Post Plume Institutional Controls means the provisions of this Article which are intended to prohibit human consumption of potentially contaminated groundwater from wells and contamination of otherwise uncontaminated water-bearing zones located within Groundwater Control Area No. 2.

                Well means a hole or shaft sunk into the earth in order to obtain water from a natural subterranean supply or aquifer.

Article VIII. Groundwater Control Area No. 3

 

§35-84.  Purpose

 (A)  The Parkview Well Superfund Site (Site) is located in the southwestern portion of the city of Grand Island in Hall County, Nebraska. The Site consists of two areas of groundwater contamination and associated source areas which resulted from the historical mismanagement of industrial solvents.

(B)  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued an Interim Record of Decision dated September 26, 2006 (Interim ROD), and a Record of Decision dated September 30, 2007 (Final ROD), and an Explanation of Significant Differences for the Site. The RODs identified two contaminant source areas. A contaminant source area located at a facility at 3304 Engleman Road South has resulted in contamination in the groundwater which trends to the east. This groundwater contamination

is referred to in the RODs as the Southern Plume. A contaminant source area located at a facility at 3445 West Stolley Park Road has resulted in groundwater contamination which trends to the east. This groundwater contamination is referred to in the RODs as the Northern Plume.

(C)  The RODs presented the selected remedies for the source areas and the plumes. A component of the selected remedies in the Interim ROD is the enactment by the City of Grand Island of an institutional control ordinance designating a Groundwater Control Area through which groundwater use would be restricted to prevent human exposure and consumption of contaminated groundwater and prohibit the installation of new wells supplying water for human consumption in the plume areas. This institutional control ordinance is to remain in full force and effect until the groundwater contamination identified in the RODs is reduced to a level making the groundwater safe to be used as a source of drinking water pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f  300j-26, or its successor legislation.

          The lawful use of land or buildings existing on June 30, 1969, although such does not conform to the provisions hereof, may be continued except as provided herein, but if continuous operation is suspended, ceased or discontinued for a period of twelve months, any further use of said land or buildings shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

 

§36-31.  Nonconforming Buildings and Uses; Repairs or Alterations
          No structural alterations shall be made to any building which will increase its degree of nonconformity except as may be ordered or required by law, ordinance or regulations.

§36-32.  Nonconforming Buildings and Uses; Change of Use
          If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to a different use if that use is more conforming in nature.

          A building, structure or portion thereof, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use which is not permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, which is, or hereafter becomes, vacant and remains unoccupied or is not used for a continuous period of twelve months, shall be conclusively presumed to have been discontinued and abandoned as a nonconforming use, and shall not thereafter be occupied or used except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.

 

§36-35.  Nonconforming Buildings and Uses; Extension of Nonconforming Uses
          The city council may, when it deems proper, permit repairs, alterations, extensions, expansions, and the remodeling or rebuilding of such structures or extensions or expansions of a land use in all cases where a refusal to do so would bring hardship to the owner or occupants and in all cases where justice requires the granting of the same. The city council may attach appropriate conditions to the granting of any such relief. Whenever a use district shall be hereafter changed, any then existing nonconforming use in such changed district may be continued or changed to a use permitted in that zoning district, provided, all other regulations governing the new use are complied with.

 

§36-36.  Fees

          Intent: The (AG-1) Primary Agricultural Zoning District regulations are intended to provide for the preservation of lands best suited for agricultural uses of all types including feed lots and the commercial feeding of livestock and accessory uses; to prevent encroachment of uses of land that could be mutually incompatible and continue to provide for agricultural uses as a major asset to the economy of the area of the use and conservation of agricultural land, to protect the value of such land, and to protect it from indiscriminate residential and urban development and other incompatible and conflicting land uses. The (AG-1) Primary Agricultural Zoning District is also intended to conserve and protect the value of open space, wooded areas, streams, mineral deposits and other natural resources and to protect them from incompatible land uses and to provide for their timely utilization. The zoning district intends to provide for the location and to govern the establishment and operation of land uses that are compatible with agriculture and are of such nature that their location away from residential, commercial and industrial areas is most desirable.

§36-80.  (GCO) Gateway Corridor Overlay District 
                Intent: The City of Grand Island has established basic site and building development criteria to be implemented within the boundaries of this overlay district. These criteria include, but are not limited to the following: landscaping, building material selection, lighting, and interior street development. The purpose for regulating these issues is to provide for a cohesive and properly developed entrance into the City of Grand Island from the Interstate corridor. Guiding development in this manner promotes the general health, safety and welfare of the residents within the zoning jurisdiction of the City, by providing quality design and construction that will also aid in the protection of past and future investment in the corridor.

                Purpose: The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items that affect the physical aspect of Grand Island's environment. Pertinent to appearance is the design of the site, building and structures, planting, signs, street hardware, and miscellaneous other objects that are observed by the public.

                The criteria contained herein are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles that can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve taxable values, and promote the public health, safety and welfare.

§36-90.  Conditional Uses; Procedure
          After receipt of a conditional use application and application fee, the city clerk shall schedule a public hearing before the city council to consider such application. Notice of such application shall be placed in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least one time ten days prior to such hearing. In addition to the publication, the city clerk shall cause a notice to be posted in a conspicuous place on the property on which action is pending. Such notice shall not be less than eighteen inches in height and twenty-four inches in width with a white or yellow background and black letters not less than one and one-half inches in height. Such posted notice shall be so placed upon the premises that it is easily visible from the street nearest the same and shall be so posted at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing. It shall be unlawful for anyone to remove, mutilate, destroy, or change such posted notice prior to such hearing. Any person so doing shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. The hearing shall be held at which all interested parties shall be heard.

          The city council may grant, grant with any conditions or safeguards upon the property benefitted by a conditional use, or deny the application. Violation of any such conditions or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a misdemeanor. No conditional use permitting the erection or alteration of a building or other use shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless the building is erected or altered or the use established within that period.

          The city administrator or any department director having a personal knowledge of any violation of a permitted conditional use or a condition or safeguard which is made part of the terms under which a conditional use is granted, may deliver a written request to the building department director asking that the director issue a notice of violation and demand for compliance to the person owning the property subject to the permitted conditional use. Upon receipt of said written request, the building department director shall investigate the alleged violation and if it is determined that a violation exists, the building department director shall send a notice of violation and demand for compliance to the last known address of said person, one copy each, by ordinary first class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested, demanding that the premises be brought into compliance with the conditional use by a date certain and advising said person that in the event violations continue after said date, that a request for revocation of the conditional use will be forwarded to the city council for a public hearing and determination. The written notice shall include a description of the violations and the underlying facts supporting such allegations.

          If the violations stated in the foregoing notice and demand are not eliminated and the property brought into compliance with the city code and the permitted conditional use by the date certain, the building department director shall send such person a notice of hearing before the city council to consider revocation of the conditional use permit. The public hearing shall be conducted formally. The building department director, city attorney or their respective designees shall present oral or written statements or reasons supporting revocation of the permitted conditional use. The property owner(s) or designee(s) shall present oral or written statements or reasons opposing the revocation of the permitted conditional use. Statements by each side shall be limited to a total time of one hour or less. Any interested person may be heard following presentations on behalf of the city and the property owner. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the city council may affirm, revoke, or modify the permitted existing use.

 

§36-91.  Fees
          At the time of filing of an application for a conditional use permit with the city clerk, the applicant shall pay to the city treasurer a processing fee, as provided in the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule, which shall not be refundable.

Article VII.  Supplemental Regulations

 

§36-96.  Off-Street Parking Requirements
  (A) Purposes:

  (1) It is the intent of this section that all buildings and uses shall provide off-street parking and loading facilities in a minimum amount as required herein to meet the needs of such buildings and uses on private property and under the same ownership as such buildings or uses. The accommodations may consist of lots, garages, or other buildings, and accessories; they may be surface facilities or facilities above or under the ground.

  (2) It is the further intent of this section that all off-street parking and loading spaces and facilities shall be sited and built according to the requirements contained in this section, and shall require an application for and issuance of a building permit pursuant to §8-22.

  (B) Application. Each building or use hereafter constructed, and each addition to or altered building or use shall be provided with off-street parking and loading spaces as required herein. Each off-street parking space or loading facility and space hereafter constructed, upon proper application and permit being granted shall be sited and constructed pursuant to the requirements of this section. No application for a building permit for such building, addition, alteration, or use shall be approved unless accompanied by a plot plan showing the location and amount of off-street parking and loading spaces as required herein for the existing or proposed building or use and including all such additions or alterations. No occupancy or use permit shall be issued unless the required parking and loading facilities shall have been provided in accordance with the approved plot plan. Requirements shall be applicable to all zones and districts but not to include the following business districts or tracts of land as identified below:

  (1) Central Business District Beginning at the intersection of Sycamore Street and First Street; thence westerly on First Street to Pine Street; thence southerly on Pine Street to the southerly boundary of Courthouse Addition; thence westerly along the southerly boundary of Courthouse Addition to Locust Street; thence westerly on Division Street to Walnut Street; thence northerly on Walnut Street to the alley between Division Street and First Street; thence westerly on said alley to Cedar Street; thence northerly on Cedar Street to the alley between Second Street and Third Street; thence westerly on said alley to Elm Street; thence northerly on Elm Street to a point 40 feet north of the southerly right-of-way line of the Union Pacific Railroad; thence easterly parallel to and 40 feet from said right-of-way line to Walnut Street; thence northerly on Walnut Street to a point 100 feet north of the northerly right-of-way line of South Front Street; thence easterly parallel to and 100 feet from said right-of-way line to Kimball Avenue extended; thence southerly on Kimball Avenue extended and Kimball Avenue to the alley between Third Street and Second Street; thence southerly on Sycamore Street to the point of beginning.

  (2) Fourth Street Business District. Beginning at the intersection of Eddy Street and the alley in the block between Fourth and Fifth Streets; thence easterly on the alley to the intersection of the alley with Sycamore Street; thence southerly on Sycamore Street to 100 feet south of the south right-of-way line of North Front Street; thence westerly on the aforesaid line to its intersection with Eddy Street; thence northerly on Eddy Street to the point of beginning.

  (3) Tracts of land ten acres or more used for seasonal events (one event every three months) of not more than fourteen consecutive days in duration and a minimum of fourteen days between events.

  (C) Area and Computation: An off-street parking space shall be of appropriate dimensions of not less than 180 square feet exclusive of access or maneuvering area, ramps, columns, etc., and shall have a vertical clearance of not less than seven feet. An off-street loading space shall be of appropriate dimensions of not less than 360 square feet exclusive of access or maneuvering area, ramps, columns, etc., and shall have a vertical clearance of not less than fourteen feet. When determination of the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.

(D) Location: All off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot as the building or within 300 feet of the lot. Permanent off-street parking spaces shall not be permitted within the required front yard setback, provided, however, that for a building containing three dwelling units or less, one space per unit may be placed within the front yard setback if such space is not directly in front of the building excluding garages or carports. Residential Garages with overhead doors facing the street shall provide a 25 foot setback between the garage door and the property line.

  (E) Collective Facilities: Off-street parking facilities for separate or mixed buildings or uses may be provided collectively so long as the total number of spaces is not less than the sum of the separate required spaces, and provided further, that the requirement concerning location of such facility with respect to distance from the building or use served shall be complied with. In order to eliminate a multiplicity of entrances and exits and diminish traffic hazards to conserve space where space is at a premium and to promote orderly development generally, the city council is hereby authorized to plan and group parking facilities collectively for a number of businesses in a given area, and especially in the central business district, in such a manner as to obtain a maximum of efficiency and capacity in parking and traffic movement.

  (F) Employee Parking: Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty on the premises at any one time.

  (G) Design Standards. All off-street parking and loading facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley and contain adequate and safe maneuvering areas. Detailed plans shall be submitted to the public works director for approval of all curb cuts or driveway openings before a permit may be obtained therefor. No signs shall be displayed except such signs as required for the orderly use of the facilities. All facilities shall be provided with a permanent type, dust-free surface meaning asphaltic cement concrete, Portland cement concrete, or paving brick.

  All parking lots containing five or more parking spaces, which are within 30 feet of property occupied by a residential use in a Large Lot Residential Zoning District or of property within a Suburban Residential Zoning District, Low Density Residential Zoning District, Medium Density Residential Zoning District, High Density Residential Zoning District or Residential Development Zoning District, shall provide a sight-obscuring fence or screen not less than six feet nor more than eight feet in height along the boundary of the parking lot adjacent to such districts. No fence or screen shall be required between abutting parking lots or adjacent to an alley. The height of any fence or screen shall be subject to other restrictions provided by the City Code.

  (H) Maintenance: The parking and loading facilities required by this section shall be provided and maintained so long as the use exists which the facilities are designed to serve. Reasonable precautions must be taken by the owners of particular uses to assure the use of the parking facilities only by the employees or the social or business visitors of the premises for which the facilities are provided. The facilities must be so designed and maintained as not to constitute a nuisance at any time and must not be used in such a manner as to constitute a hazard or unreasonable impediment to traffic.

  (I) Reduction of Number of Spaces: Off-street parking or loading facilities shall not be reduced in total extent, after their provision required hereunder, except upon the approval of the Board of Adjustment, and then only after proof that the parking or loading spaces are no longer required by reason of a change in use of the premises of which the facilities are adjunct.

  (J) Requirement for Uses Not Listed: For any use not listed, the Board of Adjustment shall determine the proper requirement by classifying the proposed use among the uses specified herein so as to assure equal treatment.

  (K) Administration and Enforcement: The off-street parking and loading provisions of this section shall be administered by the zoning official and enforced by the chief building official, who shall also serve in advisory capacity to the city council on matters relative to any phase of such provisions.

  (L) Penalty for Violation: The provisions of parking and loading facilities as required by this section shall be a continuing obligation of the owner or sponsor of a given building or use so long as the building or use is in existence and so long as parking and loading facilities are required hereunder in connection therewith, and it shall be unlawful to discontinue, change, or dispense with such facilities without establishing alternate facilities that meet the requirements herein. Penalty provisions applicable to this chapter as a whole shall apply to the violations of these provisions. In addition, at such time as the facilities required hereunder shall fail to continue to be available for the purpose, the building permit for the structures to which the facilities are adjunct and the use or occupancy permits issued for the premises shall be canceled and become null and void.

Article VIII.  Flood Plain Regulations

 

§36-117.  Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purposes
          (A) Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.  The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has in Sections 31-1001 to 31-1022, R.R.S. 1943 assigned the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.

          (B) Findings of Fact

   (1) Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The flood hazard areas of Grand Island, Nebraska, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

                (2) General Causes of the Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:  (a) The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, (b) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

   (3)Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Article uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps.

      (a) Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation.  The base flood is selected for this Article.  It is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this Article.  It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood Insurance Study, and illustrative materials dated March 2, 1983 as amended, and any future revisions thereto.

      (b) Calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood.

      (c) Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.

      (d) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile.

      (e) Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood.

          (C) Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §36-117(B)(1) herein by applying the provisions of this Article to:

                (1) Restrict or prohibit uses, which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.

                (2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities, which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.

                (3) Protect individuals from buying lands, which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.

                (4) Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.

 

§36-118.  General Provisions
          (A) Lands to which Article applies. This Article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Grand Island identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated September 26, 2008, and any revisions thereto, as numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including AE, AO and AH Zones) and within the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in §36-120 of this chapter. In all areas covered by this Article, no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain permit to develop, granted by the City Council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in §36-121, 36-122, and 36-123 herein.

          (B) The enforcement officer. The Building Director and/or Planning Director of the community, or their designee is hereby designated as the community's duly designated Enforcement Officer under this Article.

          (C) Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map or Floodway Map.  Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary interpretation.  In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute.  The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land.  The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires.

          (D) Compliance. Within identified special flood hazard areas of this community, no development shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations.

          (E) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Article to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  However, where this Article imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this Article shall prevail. All other sections inconsistent with this Article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

          (F) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.

          (G) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris.  This Article does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

          (H) Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this Article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Article shall not be affected thereby.

          (I) Appeal. Where a request for a permit to develop or a variance is denied by the Building Director and/or Planning Director, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment.

 

§36-119.  Development Permit
          (A) Permit Required. No person, firm or corporation shall initiate any floodplain development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate permit for development.

          (B) Administration

                (1) The Building Director and/or Planning Director or their designee, is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this Article.

                (2) Duties of the Building Director and/or Planning Director shall include, but not be limited to:

                (a) Review all development permit applications to assure that the permit requirements of this Article have been satisfied.

                (b) Require verification, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures in special flood hazard areas.

                (c) Require verification, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed.

                (d) When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure the Building Director and/or Planning Director shall be presented certification from a registered professional engineer as to the floodproof design.

          (C) Application for Permit. To obtain a floodplain development permit, the applicant shall first file an application in writing on a form furnished for that purpose.  Every such application shall:

   (1) Identify and describe the development to be covered by the floodplain development permit.

   (2) Describe the land on which the proposed development is to be done by lot, block, tract and house and street address, or similar description that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building or development.

   (3) Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed development is intended.

   (4) Be accompanied by plans and specifications for proposed construction.

   (5) Be signed by the permittee or his authorized agent who may be required to submit evidence to indicate such authority.

   (6) Give such other information as reasonably may be required by the Building Director and/or Planning Director.

 

§36-120.  Establishment of Zoning Districts
          Along watercourses where a floodway has been established, the mapped floodplain areas are hereby divided into the two following overlay districts:  A floodway overlay district (FW) and a flood fringe overlay district (FF) as identified in the Flood Insurance Study [and accompanying map(s)].  Within these districts all new uses not meeting the standards of this Article and those standards of the underlying zoning district shall be prohibited.

 

§36-121.  Standards for Floodplain Development
          (A) No permit for development shall be granted for new construction, substantial improvements and other development(s) including the placement of manufactured homes within all numbered and unnumbered A zones (including AE, AO, and AH zones) unless the conditions of this Section are satisfied.

          (B) All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the base flood; however, the water surface elevation was not provided. The unnumbered A zones shall be subject to all development provisions of this chapter.

(E) Conditions for Variances

     (1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items 8.52-8.56 below) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

     (2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

     (3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels along the floodway profile during the base flood discharge would result.

     (4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

     (5) Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.

     (6) The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Article.

 

§36-125.  Nonconforming Uses
           (A) A structure or the use of a structure or premises as of August 1, 2004 or amendment of the chapter, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this Article may be continued subject to the following conditions:

  (2) Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.

          (B) If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred except that if it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this Article. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued designation.

 

§36-126.  Penalties for Violation
          Violation of the provisions of this Article or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or special exceptions) shall constitute a misdemeanor.  Any person who violates this Article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $100.00, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case.  Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

          Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city or other appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action is as necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

 

§36-127.  Amendments
          The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this Article may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, provided, however, that no such action may be taken until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.  Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. At least 10 days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the public hearing.  A copy of such amendments will be provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

          Start of Construction  [for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)] includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.  The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

§36-142.  Powers and Limitations
          The board of adjustment shall, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be established by the city council, have the following powers:

                (A) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures.

                (B) To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any zoning regulation, requests for interpretation of any map, or for decisions upon other special questions upon which the board is authorized by any such regulation to pass.

                (C) Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, the strict application of any enacted regulation under this chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this code or any ordinance or resolution. No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds that:

  (1) The strict application of the zoning regulations would produce undue hardship;

  (2) Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity;

  (3) The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of variance; and

  (4) The granting of such variance is based upon reason of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice.

          No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the zoning regulations.

 

§36-143.  Action and Vote Required
          In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such regulation or to effect any variation in such regulation.

 

§36-144.  Appeals to District Court

§36-150.  Amendments; Initiation and Application
          Amendments may be initiated by the city council, the planning commission, or by application signed by the owner of a parcel sought to be amended, or by a purchaser under contract in writing duly executed by both buyer and seller, or by the agent of any of the foregoing duly authorized to do so in writing. An application shall be filed with the city clerk in such form and accompanied by such information as required by the city council and herein prescribed. A copy of the application and supplementary information shall be forwarded by the city clerk to the planning commission for hearing and recommendation.

          At the time of filing of an application for a rezoning amendment (map or text) with the city clerk, the applicant shall pay to the city treasurer a processing fee, as provided in the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule, which shall not be refundable.

 

 

§36-151.  Amendments; Procedure
          The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on all proposed amendments. Notice of such hearing shall be placed in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least one time ten days prior to such hearing. Notification of such proposed amendment and hearing shall be sent to the proper school district or districts at least ten days prior to such hearing. The commission may recommend other property for amendment in addition to that sought in an application. Following the hearing, the commission shall take action and shall transmit its recommendation to the city council, a copy of which shall be sent to the applicant and one copy shall be retained in the permanent files of the planning commission. Upon receipt of the recommendation from the planning commission, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment. Notice of such hearing shall be placed in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least one time ten days prior to such hearing. In addition to the publication, the city clerk shall cause a notice to be posted in a conspicuous place on the property on which action is pending. Such notice shall not be less than eighteen inches in height and twenty-four inches in width with a white or yellow background and black letters not less than one and one-half inches in height. Such posted notice shall be so placed upon the premises that it is easily visible from the street nearest the same and shall be so posted at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing. It shall be unlawful for anyone to remove, mutilate, destroy, or change such posted notice prior to such hearing. Any person so doing shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. If the record title owners of any lots included in such proposed change be nonresidents of the municipality, then a written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by certified mail to them addressed to their last known addresses at least ten days prior to such hearing. The provisions requiring that notice be posted on the premises to be rezoned shall not apply in the event of a proposed change in such regulations, restrictions, or boundaries throughout the entire area of an existing zoning district or of such municipality, or in the event additional or different types of zoning districts are proposed, whether or not such additional or different districts are made applicable to areas, or parts of areas, already within a zoning district of the municipality; but the only requirement then shall be the publication of the notice in the newspaper as provided in this section. The city council shall approve or disapprove the proposed amendment. A majority vote of all the members of the city council shall be required to adopt any zoning amendment. Notice of the final action shall be sent to the applicant and one copy shall be sent to the planning commission.

 

§36-152.  Amendment; Protest; Limitation
          In case of a protest against such zoning district change, signed by owners of twenty percent or more, either of the area of the lots included in such proposed change or of those immediately adjacent on the sides and in the rear thereof extending three hundred feet therefrom, and of those directly opposite thereto extending three hundred feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members of the city council. Whenever a change of land use has been finally disapproved by the city council, neither the planning commission nor the city council shall consider the same or similar application for change of land use affecting the same property for a period of six months from the date of such disapproval by the city council.

Article XI.  Wireless Communication Towers

 

§36-168.  Purpose
          The Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Act) grants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) jurisdiction over certain aspects of telecommunications services.  This Article is intended to regulate macro cell towers, telecommunications facilities and antennas in the City in conformance with the Act without prohibiting or intending to prohibit any person from providing wireless communications services.  Telecommunications facilities, towers and antennas in the City shall be constructed in a way to protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impact through careful design, siting, and camouflaging, to promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and other antenna support structures rather than the construction of additional single use towers, to avoid potential damage to property caused by towers, telecommunications facilities and antennas by ensuring  such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, repaired and removed when no longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound and to ensure that towers and antennas are compatible with surrounding land uses.

 

§36-169.  Definitions
As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

  Antenna means communications equipment that transmits or receives electromagnetic radio frequency signals used in providing wireless services.

  Antenna Support Structure means any building or structure other than a tower which can be used for the location of telecommunications facilities. 

  Applicant means any person that applies for a Tower Development Permit.

Application means a process by which the owner of a tract of land within the zoning jurisdiction of the City submits a request to develop, construct, modify, or operate a tower upon such tract of land.  The term application includes all written documentation, verbal statements, and representations, in whatever form or forum, made by an applicant to the City concerning such request.

  Engineer means any engineer qualified and licensed by the State of Nebraska. 

  Owner means any person owning personal property, or real property with fee simple title or a leasehold exceeding (ten) 10 years in duration to any tract of land within the zoning jurisdiction of the City who desires to develop, construct, modify, or operate a tower upon such tract of land.

Person means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust, or any other entity or organization.

  Stealth means any telecommunications facility, tower, or antenna which is designed to enhance compatibility with adjacent land uses, including, but not limited to, architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas, antennas integrated into architectural elements, and towers designed to look other than like a tower such as light poles, power poles and trees.

  Telecommunications Facilities means any cables, wires, lines, antennas, or any other equipment or facilities associated with the transmission or reception of communications signals which a person seeks to locate or has installed upon or near a tower or antenna support structure.  However, telecommunications facilities shall not include:  

(1) Any satellite dish two (2) meters in diameter or less which is located on real estate zoned AG, TA, RO, B1, B2, B3, M1, M2, M3 and ME.

(2) Any satellite dish of one (1) meter or less in diameter, regardless of the zoning applicable to the location of the satellite dish.

  Tower means a self-supporting lattice, guyed, or monopole structure which supports Telecommunications Facilities.  The term Tower shall not include non-commercial amateur radio operators equipment as licensed by the FCC or a structure supporting an antenna serving residential premises or dwelling units exclusively. 

  Tower Development Permit means a permit issued by the City upon approval by the Mayor and City Council of an application to develop a tower within the zoning jurisdiction of the City; which permit shall continue in full force and effect for so long as the tower to which it applies conforms to this Article. Upon issuance, a Tower Development Permit shall be deemed to run with the land during the permits duration and may be transferred, conveyed and assigned by the applicant to assignees and successors-in-interest.

  Tower Owner means any person with an ownership interest of any nature in a proposed or existing tower following the issuance of a Tower Development Permit.

All terms in this Article which are not specifically defined herein shall be construed in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Orders, Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

 

§36-170.  Location Of Towers, Construction Standards and Collocation

  (A) Towers shall be permitted conditional uses of land in only those zoning districts where specifically listed and authorized in this code.

  (B) No person shall develop, construct, modify or operate a tower upon any tract of land within the zoning jurisdiction of the City prior to approval of its application for a Tower Development Permit by the Mayor and City Council and issuance of the permit by the City.

§36-172.  Tower Development Permit, Procedure and Factors

After receipt of an application for a Tower Development Permit, the City Clerk shall schedule a public hearing before the City Council to consider such application.  Notice of such application shall be placed in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least one (1) time ten (10) days prior to such hearing.  In addition to the publication, the City Clerk shall cause a notice to be posted in a conspicuous place on the property on which action is pending.  Such notice shall be not less than eighteen (18) inches in height and twenty four (24) inches in width with a white or yellow background and black letters not less than one and one-half (1½) inches in height.  Such posted notice shall be so placed upon the premises so that it is easily visible from the street nearest the same and shall be so posted at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing.  It shall be unlawful for anyone to remove, mutilate, destroy, or change such posted notice prior to such hearing.  Any person so doing shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.  The public hearing shall be held at which all interested parties shall be heard.  The City Council may approve a Tower Development Permit as requested in the pending application with any conditions or safeguards it deems reasonable and appropriate based upon the application and input received at the public hearing or deny the application.  In all zoning districts in which towers are a permitted conditional use of land, the Tower Development Permit shall be deemed a conditional use permit for said tract of land.

 

§36-173.  Preferred Tower Locations

  (A) All new towers are permitted only after application of the following siting priorities, ordered from most-preferred (1) to least-preferred (5):

(1) manufacturing zones;

(2) commercial zones;

(3) other non-residential zoning districts;

(4) parcels of land in residential zoning districts;

(5) designated historic districts.

  (B) The applicant for a tower shall address these preferences in an alternative sites analysis prepared pursuant to §36-174 below.

 

§36-174.  Alternative Sites Analysis

  (A) For a tower, the applicant must address the Citys preferred tower locations with a detailed explanation justifying why a site of higher priority was not selected.  The Citys tower location preferences must be addressed in a clear and complete written alternative sites analysis that shows at least three (3) higher ranked, alternative sites considered that are in the geographic range of the service coverage objectives of the applicant, together with a factually detailed and meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative candidate and the proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the applicant rejected the alternative candidate.

  (B) A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection may include less than three (3) alternative sites so long as the applicant provides a factually detailed written rationale for why it could not identify at least three (3) potentially available, higher ranked, alternative sites.

  (C) For purposes of disqualifying potential collocations or alternative sites for the failure to meet the applicants service coverage or capacity objectives the applicant will provide (a) a description of its objective, whether it be to address a deficiency in coverage or capacity; (b) detailed  maps or other exhibits with clear and concise Radio Frequency (RF) data to illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative (whether it be collocation or a more preferred location); and (c) a description of why the alternative (collocation or a more preferred location) does not meet the objective.

 

§36-175.  Setbacks and Separation or Buffer Requirements
  (A) All towers up to fifty (50) feet in height shall be set back on all sides a distance equal to the underlying setback requirement in the applicable zoning district.  Towers in excess of fifty (50) feet in height shall be set back one additional foot for each foot of tower height in excess of fifty (50) feet, except where such setback is from property owned, controlled and/or maintained by the City of Grand Island and the City Council finds in granting the permit that reducing such additional setback will not cause harm to the intended use of the public property. The height of a tower shall be measured from the grade at the foot of the base pad to the top of any telecommunications facilities or antennas attached thereto.  Setback requirements shall be measured from the base of the tower to the property line of the tract of land on which it is located.

  (B) Towers exceeding one hundred (100) feet in height may not be located in any residential zoned district and must be separated from all residential zoned land and occupied structures other than those utilized by the tower owner, by a minimum of two hundred (200) feet or one hundred percent (100%) of the height of the proposed tower, whichever is greater.

  (C) Towers of one hundred (100) feet or less in height may be located in residential zoned districts provided said tower is separated from any residential structure, school, church, and/or occupied structures other than those utilized by the tower owner, by a minimum of one hundred percent (100%) of the height of the proposed tower.

  (D) Towers must meet the following minimum separation requirements from other towers:

(1) Monopole tower structures shall be separated from all other towers, whether monopole, self-supporting lattice, or guyed, by a minimum of seven hundred fifty (750) feet.

(2) Self-supporting lattice or guyed towers shall be separated from all other self-supporting or guyed towers by a minimum of one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet.

 

§36-176.  Illumination and Security Fences
  (A) Towers shall not be artificially lighted except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In cases where there are residential zoned properties located within a distance of 300% of the height of the tower, any tower subject to this Article shall be equipped with lighting that minimizes its effect on residential zoned properties.

  (B) All self-supporting lattice or guyed towers shall be enclosed within a security fence or other structure designed to preclude unauthorized access.  Monopole towers shall be designed and constructed in a manner which will preclude to the extent practical, unauthorized climbing of said structure.

 

§36-177.  Exterior Finish, Notice, Signs and Visual Impact

  (A) Exterior Finish. Towers shall have an exterior finish which enhances compatibility with adjacent land uses, subject to review and approval by the City Council as part of the application approval process. 

  (B) Notice. For purposes of this Article, any Tower Development Permit shall require notice to surrounding property owners located within two hundred (200) feet of the legal boundary of the real property where the tower is to be located. An applicant or its designee shall provide this list to the City.

  (C) Signs. No tower may bear any signage or advertisement(s) other than signage required by law or expressly permitted or required by the City.

  (D) Visual Impact. All towers are encouraged to be sited and designed to minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public to the greatest extent reasonably possible, consistent with the proper functioning of the tower.

 

§36-178.  Landscaping
          All tracts of land on which towers, antenna support structures, telecommunications facilities and/or antennas are located shall be subject to the landscaping requirements of the City Code.

 

§36-179.  Maintenance, Repair or Modification of Existing Towers
          All towers constructed or under construction on February 1, 1998 may continue in existence as a non-conforming structure and may be maintained or repaired without complying with any of the requirements of this Article. Nonconforming structures or uses may not be enlarged or the degree of nonconformance increased without complying with this Article, including applying for and obtaining a Tower Development Permit.  Any modification or reconstruction of a tower constructed or under construction after February 1, 1998, shall require compliance with the requirements of this Article including applying for and obtaining a Tower Development Permit.  Said application shall describe and specify all items which do not comply with this Article and may request, subject to approval by the Mayor and City Council, an exemption from compliance as a condition of the Tower Development Permit.

 

§36-180.  Inspections
  (A) The City reserves the right to conduct an inspection of towers, antenna support structures, telecommunications facilities and antennas upon reasonable notice to the tower owner or operator to determine compliance with this Article and to prevent structural and equipment failures and accidents which may cause damage, injuries or nuisances to the public.  Inspections may be made to determine compliance with the Building Code and any other construction standards set forth in the City Code, federal and state law or applicable Industry standards.

  (B) If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower, antenna support structure, telecommunications facilities or antennas fail to comply with codes or standards and constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon written notice being provided to the owner, the owner shall have sixty (60) days to bring such into compliance with the codes and standards.  Failure to bring such into compliance within said sixty (60) days shall constitute grounds for removal at the owners expense.

 

§36-181.  Maintenance
          The towers, antenna support structures, telecommunications facilities and antennas shall at all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order and repair so that the same do not constitute a nuisance to or a danger to the life or property of any person or the public.

 

§36-182.  Abandonment
          If any tower shall cease to be used for a period of three hundred sixty-five (365) days, the Building Department shall notify the tower owner that the site will be subject to a determination by the Building Department Director that the site has been abandoned.  Upon issuance of a Notice to Show Cause by the Building Department Director, the tower owner shall have thirty (30) days to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the tower has been in use or under repair during the period of apparent abandonment.  In the event the tower owner fails to show that the tower has been in use or under repair during the relevant period, the Building Department Director shall issue a final determination of abandonment of the site and the tower owner shall have seventy five (75) days thereafter to dismantle and move the tower.  In the event the tower is not dismantled and removed, the tower shall be declared a public nuisance by the Building Department Director, or his/her designee and a written request shall be directed to the City Attorney to proceed to abate said public nuisance pursuant to §20-15 of the Grand Island City Code, and charge the costs thereof against the real estate on which the tower is located or the owner of record of the said real estate.

 

§36-183.  Certificate of Completion, Compliance and Appearance

  (A) A certificate of completion will only be granted upon satisfactory evidence that the tower was installed in substantial compliance with the approved plans and photo simulations.

  (B) If it is found that the tower does not substantially comply with the approved plans and photo simulations, the applicant shall make any and all such changes required to bring the tower into compliance promptly.

  (C) The site and tower, including all landscaping, fencing and related transmission equipment must be maintained at all times in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans.

  (D) All graffiti at a tower site must be removed at the sole expense of the permittee after notification by the City to the owner or operator of the tower.

  (E) If any FCC, State or other governmental license or any other governmental approval to provide communication services is ever revoked as to any tower site permitted or authorized by the City, the permittee must inform the City of the revocation within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of such revocation.

Article V. Grand Island PACE District

 

§37-36.  Grand Island PACE (GI-PACE) District; Creation

               The City of Grand Island desires to create a clean energy assessment district to enable property assessed clean energy financing for its property owners while; to authorize the clean energy assessment district to enable third-party lenders to accept applications and enter into financing agreements with property owners within the boundaries of the district; and to create a clean energy assessment district, which shall be known as the Grand Island PACE District (GI-PACE), as authorized by Nebraska Revised Statute Sections 13-3203 and 13-3204(3), which boundaries shall be the corporate boundaries of the City of Grand Island and its extraterritorial jurisdiction.

 

§37-37.  Findings and Determinations   

               That the City Council of the City of Grand Island, Nebraska (the City), hereby finds and determines as follows:                                  

               Pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §§13-3201 to 13-3211, inclusive, the Property Assessment Clean Energy Act (the Act), energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy are important for preserving the health and economic well-being of Nebraskas citizens.  Using less energy decreases the cost of living and keeps the cost of public power low by delaying the need for additional power plants.  To further these goals, it is necessary for the City to promote energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems.  Upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems may prohibit or deter many property owners from making improvements.  It is necessary for the City to implement an alternative financing method through the creation of a clean energy assessment district.                                

               Financing energy projects to further these goals is a valid purpose and can be accomplished through Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing, which is used to overcome the upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems by using private capital and equity, rather than public debt.

               Pursuant to the Act and Neb. Rev. Stat. §13-3204, the City of Grand Island is authorized to establish a clean energy assessment district so that owners of qualifying property can access PACE financing for energy efficiency improvements or renewable energy improvements to their properties located in the City.  The City also may enter into an agreement with one or more other municipalities pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. §§13-801, et seq., for the joint creation, administration, or creation and administration of clean energy assessment districts, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §13-3210.  The City declares its intent that the provisions of this Chapter shall be in conformity with federal and state laws.  The City enacts this Chapter pursuant to the Act, as amended.

 

§37-38.  Title and Definitions

               Except the words and phrases specifically defined below or in Neb. Rev. Stat. §13-3203, as amended, words and phrases used in this Article shall have their customary meanings.  As used in this Chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:

Geothermal Water Source Heat Pump System  A geothermal system uses the Earths thermal properties in conjunction with electricity to provide greater efficiency in the heating and cooling of buildings.

Geothermal System (Closed Loop)  A mechanism for heat exchange, which consists of the following basic elements: Underground loops of piping; heat transfer fluid; a heat pump; an air distribution system. An opening is made in the Earth. A series of pipes are installed into the opening and connected to a heat exchange system in the building. The pipes form a closed loop and are filled with a heat transfer fluid. The fluid is circulated through the piping from the opening into the heat exchanger and back. The system functions in the same manner as the open loop system except there is no pumping of well or surface water.

Geothermal System (Open Loop)  Water is pumped from a well or surface water into a heat exchanger located in a surface building. The water drawn from the Earth is then pumped back into the aquifer through a different well or in some cases the same well, otherwise known as re-injection. Alternatively, the ground water could be discharged the Earths surface or a surface water body, also known as pump & dump. In the heating mode, cooler water is returned to the Earths surface or surface water body, while in the cooling mode warmer water is returned to the Earths surface or surface water body.

§40-12.  Post-Construction.

The purpose of this section is to provide requirements and criteria to prevent and manage stormwater pollution and to diminish adverse impacts to health, safety, property, and the general welfare of the citizens of the City of Grand Island through regulating stormwater runoff from areas of development and redevelopment to the maximum extent practicable as required by the Federal Clean Water Act, 33.U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (as amended to date), the Nebraska Environmental Protection Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 81-1501 et seq. (as amended to date) and the rules and regulations promulgated under such Acts. This chapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding and regulating the design, construction, and maintenance of areas of development and redevelopment. Additional criteria can be found in the City of Grand Island Post-Construction Stormwater Guidance Manual.

(A)         POSTCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENT OF PERMANENT BMPs/STFs.

(1)          Land development that meets the requirements of Section 40-11 (a) (1) must address stormwater runoff quality through the use of permanent BMPs/STFs. Permanent BMPs/STFs shall be provided for in the drainage plan for any subdivision plat, annexation plat, development agreement, subdivision agreement or other local development plan.

(2)          Structural BMPs/STFs located on private property shall be owned and operated by the owner(s) of the property on which the BMP is located; unless the City of Grand Island agrees in writing that a person or entity other than the owner shall own or operate such BMP/STF. As a condition of approval of the BMP/STFs, the owner shall also agree to maintain the BMP/STF in perpetuity to its design capacity unless or until the City of Grand Island shall relieve the property owner of that responsibility in writing. The obligation to maintain the BMP/STF shall be memorialized on the subdivision plat, annexation plat, development agreement, subdivision agreement or other form acceptable to the City of Grand Island and shall be recorded with the City of Grand Island Public Works Department.

(3)          The preferred Structural BMPs/STFs that are acceptable in the City of Grand Island and its 2 mile jurisdictional boundary without additional review by the Public Works Director are: Bioswales, Rain Gardens, Permeable Pavement, Green Roofs, Retention Ponds, and Detention Ponds (Provided the detention Ponds include treatment areas to improve water quality; i.e. a treatment forebay and filtration strip). If there are other stormwater treatment measures a developer would like to use, plans for those measures will need to be submitted to and approved in writing by the Director of Public Works, prior to construction and development.

(4)          A Post Construction Stormwater Management Plan (PCSWMP) shall be submitted to the planning department for transmittal to the Public Works Director on a form or format specified by the director, as part of any preliminary plat application required under Sec.33-7; if not already submitted as part of a preliminary plat process. For any significant redevelopment, a post-construction stormwater management plan shall be submitted along with the permit application for any activity requiring a building permit under Sec.33-6.

a.            For all developments that have not had a preliminary plat approved prior to January 1, 2019, the post-construction stormwater management plan, at a minimum, shall include Low Impact Development (LID) STFs to provide for water quality control of the first one-half inch of runoff from the site. The director may also require this minimum control level for replats that significantly increase the amount of impervious area in a preliminarily platted subdivision, which was approved prior to July 1, 2018.

b.            For all developments with plats preliminarily approved after July 1, 2018 and for significant redevelopment projects, the post-construction stormwater management plan, at a minimum shall include the STF or STFs selected, the STF design, schedules and procedures for inspection and maintenance of the STFs, and where it is reasonably practicable, include STFs for water quality control of the first one-half inch of runoff from the site. Provisions for STFs are set forth in the Grand Island Post-Construction Stormwater Management Guide. For significant redevelopment projects that involve replacement of building structures without significant disturbance of existing parking or other pervious areas, BMPs for water quality control of the first one-half inch of runoff from the site shall not be required. For significant redevelopment projects involving an outlot parcel that is part of a greater existing development, the calculation of the area requiring control of the first one-half inch of runoff shall be based only on the impervious area of the project site that is being added or disturbed within the out lot parcel.

(B)  Exemptions from the Post-Construction Storm Water Management Plan

Systems designed to accommodate only one single family dwelling unit, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex, provided the single unit is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale, are exempt from the requirements in this Ordinance to submit a Post-Construction Storm Water Management Plan.

Additional policies and procedures for the development and implementation requirements for BMPs/STFs can be found in the City of Grand Island Post-Construction Stormwater Management Guide.

 

(C)         COMPLETION OF PERMANENT BMPs/STFs.

Upon completion of a project, the City of Grand Island shall be provided a written certification stating that the completed project is in compliance with the approved Final Drainage Plan. All applicants are required to submit as built plans for any permanent BMPs once final construction is completed and must be signed by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Nebraska.

(D)         ONGOING INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF PERMANENT BMPs/STFs.

(1)          The owner of site must, unless an on-site stormwater management facility or practice is dedicated to and accepted by the City of Grand Island, execute an inspection and maintenance agreement, that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the permanent BMPs/STFs.

(2)          Permanent BMPs/STFs included in a Drainage Plan which is subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and to ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement, the plan and this Ordinance.

a.            All BMPs/STFs must be inspected by the owner, using an approved inspection form,(Appendix B of the Grand Island Post-Construction Guidance Manual), for maintenance and repair requirements at a minimum, once per quarter.

b.            All BMPs/STFs shall be inspected, by a qualified employee of the City of Grand Island, twice per year to ensure owner compliance with the design of the BMP/STF and to ensure maintenance and repair actions are adequately monitored.

(3)          The maintenance agreement shall also provide that if, after notice by the City to correct a violation requiring maintenance work, satisfactory corrections are not made by the owner(s) or occupant within a reasonable period of time (30 days maximum), and the City may perform all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. The owner(s) or occupant of the facility shall be assessed the cost of the work and any lawful penalties.

§40-13.  Technical Standards,  Specifications, And Guidance.

All BMPs/STFs designed to meet the requirements of this Ordinance shall reference the appropriate technical standards, specifications and guidance as follows:

The City of Grand Island may adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drainage system, or waters of the United States of America. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at the owner or operators expense, reasonable protection from discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drainage system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural Best Management Practices. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said persons expense, additional structural and non-structural Best Management Practices to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. These Best Management Practices shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan as necessary for compliance with requirements of any National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.

 

§40-16.  Watercourse Protection


Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, and such persons lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.

 

§40-17.  Notification of Discharges and Spills


Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility, premises, or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of materials which result or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drainage system, or waters of the United States of America, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies and the City of Grand Island of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non- hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City of Grand Island in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person, by phone, or by facsimile shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the City of Grand Island within three business days of the prior notice.
