such work or improvement, and there shall be separate accounting as to each
work or improvement so executed.  All contracts for public work or improvements

to such contracts shall contain a reservation of the foregoing right. 
Contracts entered into by the city shall be signed by the manager or by such
other officer, or officers, of the city as the commission may by ordinance
provide.  In times of emergency the city manager or the city purchasing agent
may employ such labor and make such purchases of supplies and materials as are
necessary without prior authorization by the commission.  However, a report
thereof shall be filed with the commission forthwith.

IMPROVEMENTS AND ASSESSMENTS
SECTION 69  LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   The commission shall have power by ordinance to provide for the
construction, reconstruction, repair and maintenance of all things in the
nature of local improvements, and to provide for the payment of any part of the
cost thereof by levying and collecting special assessments upon abutting,
adjacent and contiguous or other specially benefited property.  The amount
assessed against the property specially benefited to pay for any such local
improvement shall not exceed the amount of benefits accruing to such property.
SECTION 70  METHODS OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT.
   Special assessments upon the property deemed benefited by a public
improvement shall be by any one of the following methods:
   (A)   By percentage of the tax value of the property assessed.
   (B)   In proportion to the benefits which may result from the improvement.
   (C)   By the foot frontage of the property bounding or abutting upon the
improvement.
SECTION 71  PRELIMINARY RESOLUTION.
   When it is deemed necessary to make a pubic improvement to be paid for in
whole or in part by special assessment, the commission shall declare the
necessity therefor by resolution, and such resolution shall state the method of
assessment, the mode of payment and the number of annual installments.  Such
resolution shall be certified to the director of finance, who shall thereupon
proceed to make an assessment report, in accordance with the method of
assessment provided in the resolution, which report shall be filed with the
commission and shall show the lots and lands assessed, and the amount of the
assessment as to each, and the number of installments, not exceeding ten, in
which such assessments shall be paid.
SECTION 72  PLANS OF PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.
   At the time of the passage of the resolution provided for in the foregoing
section there shall be on file in such office as the city manager may
designate, plans, specifications, estimates, and profiles of the proposed
improvement; and such plans, specifications, estimates and profiles shall be
open to the inspection of all interested persons.
SECTION 73  NOTICES SERVED.
   Upon the filing of his report the director of finance shall cause written
notice to be served upon the owner of each lot or parcel of land to be assessed
or otherwise affected, or upon the persons in whose names the same may be
assessed for taxation upon the tax duplicate.  Such notice shall be served as
is provided for service of summons in civil actions; and as to all nonresidents
and persons who cannot be found publication of such notice shall be made at
lease once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.  The notice shall
contain a statement of the character of the proposed improvement, the fact that
the assessment report has been filed with the commission, the rate of such
assessment, the number of installments, and shall state a time and place when
complaints and claims will be heard before the board of revision of
assessments.
SECTION 74  BOARD OF REVISION OF ASSESSMENTS.
   The mayor, the director of law and the director of finance shall constitute
the board of revision of assessments.  The mayor shall be the president of the
board and the director of finance shall be the secretary thereof.  It shall
meet from time to time as provided by its rules, and shall hear all claims and
objections as to the character of all improvements to be paid for in part or in
whole by special assessment as provided in the assessment report.  A majority
of those constituting the board of revision of assessments shall have power to
determine all complaints and objections submitted to it; and as to each
improvement, the board shall, after such hearing, amend, equalize and adjust
the assessment report, and shall report to the commission its findings as to
the necessity for the improvement, any amendment it directs in the assessments,
the estimates of benefits and allowances of damages.
SECTION 75  CLAIMS OF DAMAGE.
   Any owner of a lot or land bounding and abutting upon a proposed improvement
claiming that he will sustain damages by reason of the improvement shall
present such claim to the board of revision of assessments within two weeks
after the service of notice or the completion of the publication herein before
provided.  Such claim shall be in writing and shall set forth the amount of
damage claimed with a general description of the property with respect to which
it is claimed the damage will accrue, and shall be filed with the director of
finance.  Any owner who fails to do so shall be deemed to have waived such
damages and shall be barred from filing a claim or receiving damages therefor. 
This provision shall apply to all damage which will obviously result from the
improvement, but shall not deprive the owner of his right to recover damages
arising, without his fault, from acts of the city or its agents.  If,
subsequent to the filing of such claim, the owner sells the property, or any
part thereof, the right to such damages, if any, shall follow the ownership of
the land without other transference of the claim.  The board of revision of
assessments shall report to the commission all such claims for damages filed
with it.
SECTION 76  FINAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Whenever the board of revision of assessments shall have made its final
report to the commission as to any improvement, the commission, if it
determines that the improvement shall proceed, shall pass an ordinance levying
the assessment as reported by the board of revision of assessments and
directing that the improvement shall proceed. In such ordinance it shall be
sufficient to describe the lots and lands abutting upon the improvement, and to
be assessed therefor, as all the lots and lands bounding and abutting upon such
improvement between and including the termini of the improvement; and in
describing lands which do not abut, it shall be sufficient to describe the lots
by the appropriate lot numbers and the lands by metes and bounds.  This rule of
description shall apply in all proceedings in which lots and lands are to be
charged with special assessments.  At the completion of the project, the final
in-place quantities and the costs to be assessed to property owners shall be
submitted to the commission for final approval by legislation authorizing
collection of the assessments.
(Adopted by electorate, November 7, 1989 – Amending Ordinance No. 58-89)
SECTION 77  PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS – LIENS.
   Special assessments shall be payable by the owners of the property assessed
at the time stipulated in the ordinance and shall be a lien from the date of
the assessment upon the respective lots and parcels of land assessed,
enforceable in the manner provided by general law.
SECTION 78  DAMAGES ASSESSED BEFORE IMPROVEMENT.
   At the time of the passage of the ordinance determining to proceed with the
improvements as herein before provided, the commission shall determine whether
the claims for damages so filed shall be allowed and paid or shall be
judicially inquired into before commencing or after the completion of the
proposed improvement.  If the commission decides that the damages shall be
assessed before commencing the improvement, the director of law shall then make
a written application to the court of common pleas, or to the probate court,
for the summoning of a jury to determine such damages, and the judge shall
direct that a jury be summoned as is provided for the appropriation of property
and fix the time and place for inquiry into and assessment of such damages,
which inquiry and assessment shall be confined to such claims.
(Adopted by electorate, November 7, 1978 – Amending Ordinance No. 45-78)
SECTION 79  DAMAGES ASSESSED AFTER IMPROVEMENT.
   When the commission determines to assess the damages after the completion of
the improvement for which a claim for damages has been filed as herein before
provided, the director of law shall within ten days after the completion of the
improvement make written application as herein before provided in the case of
the ascertainment of damages before the improvement was made, and the same
proceedings shall be had as provided in the next preceding section.
SECTION 80  LIMITATION ON DAMAGE SUITS.
   No person who claims damages arising from any cause shall commence a suit
therefor against the city until he shall have filed a claim for such damages
with the director of finance and sixty days shall have elapsed thereafter. 
This provision shall not apply to an application for an injunction or other
proceeding to which it may be necessary for such applicant to resort in case of
urgent necessity.
SECTION 81  WORK TO BE DONE.
   When the commission shall have passed an ordinance directing that an
improvement be made to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessment
the city manager shall, through the appropriate department or office, cause the
improvement to be made either directly by employment of labor or by entering
into a contract therefor as may be determined by the commission.
SECTION 82  LANDS UNALLOTTED OR NOT ON DUPLICATE.
   When special assessments are to be levies by the percentage of the tax value
of the property assessed or by the foot frontage of the property bounding and
abutting upon the improvement and there are lots or lands subject to such
assessment which are not assessed for taxation, the director of finance shall
fix, for the purpose of such assessment, the value of such lots as they stand
and of such lands at the depth which he considers a fair average of the depth
of lots in the neighborhood, so that the value so fixed will be a fair average
of the assessed value of other lots in the neighborhood. Where lands are not
subdivided into lots, but are assessed for taxation, the director of finance
shall fix the value and depth in the same manner; but the above rule shall not
apply in making a special assessment according to benefits.
SECTION 83  INTEREST ON ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   When bonds or notes are issued in anticipation of the collection of
assessments, the interest thereon shall be treated as part of the cost of the
improvement for which assessments may be made.
SECTION 84  LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS.
   The commission shall limit all assessments to the special benefits conferred
upon the property assessed, and in no case shall there be levied on any lot or
parcel of land any assessments for any or all purposes within a period of five
years in excess of thirty-three and one-third per cent (33-1/3%) of the actual
value thereof after the improvement is made.  Assessments levied for the
construction of main sewers shall not exceed the sum that, in the opinion of
the commission, would be required to construct an ordinary street sewer or
drain of sufficient capacity to drain or sewer the lots or lands to be assessed
for such improvement, nor shall any lots or lands be assessed that do not need
local drainage, or which are provided therewith.
SECTION 85  CITY’S PORTION OF COST.
   The city shall pay such part of the cost and expense of improvements for
which special assessments are levied as the commission deems just which part
shall not be less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of all such cost and expense; and in
addition thereto the city shall pay the cost of intersections. The commission
may provide for the payment of the city’s portion of all such improvements by
the issuance of bonds or notes therefor, and may levy taxes, in addition to all
other taxes authorized by law, to pay such bonds or notes and the interest
thereon.
SECTION 86  REPLACING EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   The commission may provide in whole or in part the cost of replacing any
existing local improvement by levying special assessments as hereinbefore
provided; but any assessment for replacement in less than fifteen years from
the date of a prior assessment for the improvement to be replaced shall be
limited to a sum not in excess of fifty per cent (50%) of the cost of such
replacement.
SECTION 87  ESTIMATE OF LIFE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Every ordinance providing for an improvement to be paid for in whole or in
part by special assessments shall contain an estimate of the life of the
proposed improvement, prepared as may be directed by the city manager. Any
assessment thereafter made for replacing such improvement within such estimated
period of life shall be limited to a sum not in excess of fifty per cent (50%)
of the cost of such replacement. Assessments for replacements at or after the
expiration of such estimated period of life shall be subject to no limitation
except as provided for assessments for original improvements.
SECTION 88  REBATES AND SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENTS.
   Upon the completion of any improvement the director of finance shall rebate
to the then owner of the property which shall have been assessed to pay for
such improvement, any surplus or excess remaining unexpended for the purpose
for which such assessment was made, and in the event of there being a deficit
in the fund provided for the making of any such improvement the director of
finance shall report to the commission a supplementary assessment within the
limitations hereinbefore provided, which supplementary assessment shall be made
by ordinance and certified for collection as is provided in the case of
original assessments.
SECTION 89  SEWER, WATER AND OTHER CONNECTIONS.
   The city manager, or other officer to whom the duty may be assigned by the
commission, shall have the authority to compel the making of sewer, water, gas
and other connections whenever in view of contemplated street improvements, or
as a sanitary regulation, such connections should in his judgment be
constructed.  Written notice of such determination shall be given to the owner
of each lot or parcel of land to which connections are to be made, which notice
shall state the number and character of connections required.  Such notice
shall be served by a person, designated by the city manager, or other officer,
in the manner provided for the service of summons in civil actions.  Non-
residents of the city, or persons who cannot be found, may be served by one
publication of such notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
The notice shall state the time within which such connections shall be
constructed and, if they be not constructed within said time, the work may be
done by the city and cost thereof, together with a penalty of five per cent
(5%), assessed against the lots and lands for which the connections are made. 
Said assessments shall be certified and collected in the same manner as other
assessments for street improvements.
SECTION 90  SIDEWALKS, CURBINGS AND GUTTERS.
   The commission may by resolution declare that certain specified sidewalks,
curbings or gutters shall be constructed or repaired.  Upon the passage of such
resolution the city manager or his duly authorized representative shall cause
written notice of the passage thereof to be served upon the owner, or agent of
the owner, of each parcel of land abutting upon such sidewalks, curbings or
gutters who may be a resident of the city, in the manner provided by law for
the service of summons in civil actions.  A copy of the notice, with the time
and manner of service endorsed therein, signed by the person serving it, shall
be returned to the office of the city manager or his duly authorized
representative and there filed and preserved.  For the purpose of such service,
if the owner of any such property be not a resident of the city, any person
charged with the collection of rent or the payment of taxes upon such property,
or having control thereof in any way, shall be regarded as the agent of the
owner, and service upon such personal service were made on the owner thereof. 
If it appears in any such return that the owner is a non-resident of that
neither such owner or agent could be found, one publication of a copy of the
resolution in a newspaper of general circulation in the city shall be deemed
sufficient notice to such owner.
SECTION 91  CONSTRUCTION OF SIDEWALKS, ETC., BY CITY.
   If sidewalks, curbings or gutters be not constructed or repaired within
thirty days from the service of notice provided for in the preceding section,
or within such longer period as provided by the commission, or the completion
of notice by the publication thereof, the city may proceed through the
appropriate department or office, either by direct employment of labor, or by
contract, to carry out such construction or repair at the expense of the owner,
as in the case of other improvements, and all such expenses shall be reported
by the director of finance to the commission.  The commission shall thereupon
by ordinance assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owner or owners of
all property bounding or abutting thereon, and such assessment shall be
collected in the same manner as other assessments, with a penalty of five per
cent (5%) and interest for failure to pay at the time fixed by the assessment
resolution.
(Adopted by electorate, November 7, 1989 – Amending Ordinance No. 59-89)
SECTION 92  ASSESSMENT BONDS FOR SIDEWALKS, ETC.
   The commission may at any time borrow money and authorize the issuance of
notes or bonds therefor in anticipation of the collection of assessments,
levied for the purpose of paying the cost of constructing or repairing
sidewalks, curbings and gutters which are to be or have been constructed by the
city, upon the failure of the owners of the property to construct or repair the
same, pursuant to notice as hereinbefore provided.
SECTION 93  PLAT OF SUBDIVISION.
   A proprietor of lots or grounds within the city, who subdivides or lays them
out for sale, shall cause to be made an accurate map or plat of such
subdivision, describing with certainty all grounds laid out or granted for
streets, alleys, ways, commons, or other public uses.  Lots sold or intended
for sale shall be numbered by progressive numbers, or described by the square
in which situated, and the precise length and width shall be given of each lot
sold or intended for sale.  Such map or plat shall be subscribed by the
proprietor, or his agent duly authorized in writing, and acknowledged before an
officer authorized to take the acknowledgment of deeds, who shall certify the
acknowledgment of the instrument.
SECTION 94  CITY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   Established.  The commission shall establish a City Planning
Commission of five (5) members. All of whom shall be residents of the city of
Piqua and none of whom shall be an official or employee of the city.  The
members of the Planning Commission shall serve without compensation and shall
be appointed for a term of five (5) years, except that of the members first
appointed, one shall be for a term of one (1) year, one for two (2) years, one
shall be for three (3) years, one for four (4) years, and one for five (5)
years.
   (B)   Ex-Officio Members.  The city manager and the city engineer shall be
entitled to seats on the commission, but shall have no vote therein.  The city
engineer shall be the official clerk and secretary to the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Powers.  The City Planning Commission shall have such powers as may be
determined by ordinance of the commission concerning the plan, design,
location, removal, relocation and alteration of any buildings or structures
belonging to the city or location in or on public streets or public property;
the location, widening, extension and vacation of streets, parks, parkways,
playgrounds, and other public places; the approval of plats for the subdivision
of land; location of railroads and street railways; the zoning of the city for
the purpose of regulating the location of trades, industries, apartment houses,
dwellings, or other uses of property, the height and design of buildings, the
percentage of the area of the lot which may be occupied by buildings, the area
of the lot per family of occupation, the provision of yard spaces, the fixing
of building lines, and the preparation of plans for the future physical
development and improvement of the city; and such other powers as are now or
hereafter may be conferred by general law or by ordinance of the commission.
SECTION 95  EFFECT OF PLANNING.
   From and after the date when this charter takes effect no new streets or
alleys, except those laid down on a plat bearing the approval of the Planning
Commission, shall in any way be accepted as public streets or alleys by the
city, nor shall any public funds be expended in the repair or improvement of
streets and alleys laid out and not on such plat.
SECTION 96  ALTERATION OF STREETS.
   When it deems it necessary the commission may cause any street, alley, or
public highway to be opened, straightened, altered, diverted, narrowed,
widened, or vacated.
SECTION 97  DEDICATION OF STREETS.
   No street or alley dedicated to public use by any proprietor of ground in
the city shall be deemed a public street or alley, or under the care or control
of the commission, unless the dedication shall have been accepted and confirmed
by ordinance passed for such purpose, or unless the provisions of Sections 93
and 94 hereof relating to subdivisions shall have been complied with.
SECTION 98  CREATION OR CHANGE OF NAME OF STREETS.
   The commission in vacating any street or part of any street, or changing the
name of any street, may include in one ordinance the change of name or the
vacation or narrowing of more than one street, avenue, or alley, but before
vacating any street or part thereof, or narrowing any street, the commission
shall first pass a resolution declaring its intention to do so.  The city
manager or his duly authorized representative shall cause notice of such
resolution to be served, in the manner that service of summons is required to
be made in civil actions, upon all persons whose property abuts upon the
portion of the street affected by the proposed vacation or narrowing, and by
publication once in one newspaper of general circulation in the city as to all
the persons who cannot be personally served.  Said notice shall state the time
and place at which objections can be heard before the city planning
commission.  Upon the report of the city planning commission approving the
proposed vacation or narrowing, the commission may by ordinance declare such
vacation or narrowing, and such order of the commission vacating or narrowing a
street or alley which has been dedicated to public use by the proprietor shall,
to the extent to which it is vacated or narrowed, operate as a revocation of
the acceptance thereof by the commission, but the right of way and easement
therein of any lot owner shall not be impaired thereby.
APPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY
SECTION 99  APPROPRIATION AUTHORIZED.
   Property within or without the corporate limits of the city may be
appropriated for any public or municipal purpose and, subject only to the
limitations imposed by the constitution of the state, such appropriation shall

simple title or any less estate, easement or use.  Appropriation shall be made
according to the requirements of, and as provided by, general law.
SECTION 100  DECLARATORY RESOLUTION.
   When it is deemed necessary to appropriate property the commission shall
adopt a resolution declaring such intent, defining the purpose of the
appropriation, setting forth a pertinent description of the property, and the

SECTION 101  NOTICE TO OWNERS.
   Immediately upon the adoption of such resolution the city manager or his
duly authorized representative shall cause written notice thereof to be given
to the owner, person in possession thereof, or having an interest of record in,
every piece of land sought to be appropriated, or to his authorized agent; and
such notice shall be served by a person designated for the purpose, and return
made in the manner provided by law for the service and return of summons in
civil actions.  If such owner, person, or agent, cannot be found notice shall
be given by publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the city, and the commission may thereafter pass an
ordinance directing such appropriation to proceed.
SECTION 102  FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
   Upon the passage of such ordinance the director of law shall make
application to the court of common pleas or to a judge thereof in vacation, or
to the probate court which application shall describe as correctly as possible
the land or other property to be appropriated, the interest or estate therein
to be taken, the object for which the land is desired, and the name of the
owner of each lot or parcel thereof, and all the subsequent proceedings with
regard thereto shall be in the manner provided by general law for the
appropriation of property by municipal corporations in this state.
FRANCHISE AND PUBLIC UTILITIES
SECTION 103  FRANCHISE DEFINED.

to any individual, company or corporation, for purpose of profit, of any
special privilege, except as specified in

it be held or exercised, except under authority of a franchise from the city.
SECTION 104  GRANTS, AMENDMENTS AND RENEWALS OF FRANCHISES.
   No franchise shall be granted, amended or renewed except by ordinance.  Any
such ordinance shall clearly specify the streets, alleys, public ways, places

which the franchise is to be exercised.  The commission may, by ordinance,
renew any franchise at its expiration upon such terms as it may deem conducive
to the public interest.

   Permits unconditionally revocable at the will of the commission for minor or

deemed franchises as the term is used in this charter.

by the commission as a whole, or a committee thereof; and until at least one
week after its publication in final form in the manner required for the

SECTION 107  PUBLIC UTILITY RATES; RESERVED RIGHTS OF CITY.
   The rates to be charged for the products or services of any public utility
as fixed in, or determined in the manner provided by, any franchise or any
amendment or renewal thereof, shall be sufficient only to provide a reasonable
return upon the fair value of the property of such utility used, useful and
reasonably necessary in furnishing the product or service for the furnishing of
which the franchise, amendment or renewal is, or may have been, granted; and
whether it be so specified in the ordinance or not, all franchises, and all
amendments and renewals thereof, shall be subject to the right of the city:
   (A)   To repeal the same for misuse, nonuse or failure to begin construction
within the time prescribed, or otherwise to comply with the terms prescribed;
   (B)   To require extensions of plant, equipment and service, and to
establish standards of service and quality of products, subject only to the
right to a reasonable return upon the fair value of the property as in this
section herein before defined;
   (C)   To require the maintenance of plant, equipment and fixtures at the
highest practicable standard of efficiency;
   (D)   To examine and audit the accounts and other records of the utility at

condemnation, or otherwise, all property of the utility within the city or
elsewhere used in or useful for the operation of the utility within the city;
   (F)   To impose such other reasonable regulations as may be conducive to the
safety, welfare and accommodation of the public.
SECTION 108  VALUE OF GRANT EXCLUDED.
   No ordinance granting or renewing a public utility franchise shall be valid
unless it expressly provides that the price to be paid for the property of the
utility, in case of acquisition by the city, shall exclude all value of such
franchise or renewal; and in determining the fair value of the property of a
public utility, for the purpose of permitting a reasonable return thereon, no
allowance shall be made for the value of any franchise.
SECTION 109  EXTENSIONS.
   The commission may by amendment of an existing franchise ordinance grant to
the individual company or corporation operating a public utility thereunder the
right to extend the appliances, fixtures and service of such utility in the
streets, alleys, public ways, places and grounds of the city. Any such
extension of a public utility shall become a part of the aggregate property
thereof, shall be operated as such, and shall be subject to all the obligations
and reserved rights in favor of the city contained in this charter and in the
original franchise under which such utility is being operated.  The right to
use and maintain any such extension shall terminate with the original franchise
and shall be terminable as provided in
Section 107 of this charter.
SECTION 110  CERTIFIED COPIES OF GRANTS, ETC.
   Within six months after this charter takes effect every public utility, and
every owner of a public utility franchise, shall file with the city certified
copies of all such franchises owned or claimed, or under which any such utility
is operated within the city. Certified copies of all public utility franchises,
and of all amendments, renewals and extensions thereof, made subsequent to the
taking effect of this charter shall be filed with the city by the grantee
within ten days after acceptance thereof.  No franchise to construct or operate
a public utility shall be transferable except with the approval of the
commission expressed by ordinance; and certified copies of all transfers,
mortgages and other documents affecting the title or use of public utilities
shall be filed with the city within ten days after their execution.  The
certified copies of franchises and other documents required by this section to
be filed with the city shall be filed and preserved as a public record in such
office thereof as the commission may by ordinance designate.
SECTION 111  NO EXCLUSIVE GRANT.
   No right to construct, maintain, or operate any public utility in the city
of Piqua shall be exclusive.
SECTION 112  CONSENT OF PROPERTY OWNERS.
   No consent of any owner or property abutting on any street, alley, public
way, place or ground shall be required for the construction, maintenance or
operation of any public utility therein either under the original franchise or
any renewal thereof; but any owner of such property shall be entitled to
recover from the owner of a public utility the amount of actual damage to such
property occasioned by the utility, less any benefits accruing thereto from the
utility, provided that suit is commenced within one year after damage is begun.
SECTION 113  PUBLIC UTILITY FIXTURES AND APPLIANCES.
   The commission shall at all times control the distribution of space occupied
by public utility appliances and fixtures in, over, upon or under the streets,
alleys, public ways, places and grounds of the city; and all rights granted for
the construction and operation of any public utility shall be subject to the
continuing right of the commission to require such reconstruction, relocation,
change or discontinuance of the appliances and fixtures so used by the utility
as, in the opinion of the commission shall be necessary to the public interest.
NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS
SECTION 114  GENERAL LAWS TO APPLY.

petitions need not all be appended to one paper but to each separate paper
there shall be attached an affidavit of the circulator thereof stating that
each signature thereto was made in his presence and is the genuine signature of
the person whose name is purports to be.  Each signer of a petition shall sign
his name in ink or indelible pencil and, after his name, shall designate his

§ 33.02  EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS.
   The following provisions shall apply to all Schedule A and A-1 employees
except those covered under §
33.15 of this chapter:
   (A)   Merit increases and performance ratings.
      (1)   Each of the pay ranges in Schedule A shall be divided into six
steps, 1 through 6. The minimum time in grade for each step before the employee
is eligible for a merit increase is as follows.
         1 - one year
         2 - one year
         3- one year
         4- one year
         5- one year
         6- Top Step
      (2)    Each employee’s performance will be rated by the employee’s
supervisor before the anniversary date the employee is eligible, by time in
classification, for consideration for a merit increase. An employee must
receive a performance rating of satisfactory or better to receive a merit
increase. An employee denied a merit increase due to a less than satisfactory
rating may request a reevaluation after 90 days from the denial of the merit
increase.
      (3)    Performance ratings will also be considered as a factor in
advancing probationary employees to regular status and for promoting or
transferring employees into new classifications.
      (4)    Employees at the top step of their pay range will have their
performance rated by their supervisor annually. An employee who receives two
consecutive ratings of less than satisfactory may be demoted or discharged.
Performance ratings, when completed, will be discussed with the employee. The
employee is required to sign the performance rating as evidence of the fact
that it has been reviewed. A copy will be given to the employee.
   (B)   Overtime pay. Non-exempt employees shall receive one and one-half
their regular rate for all hours worked over 40 per week.
      (1)    The city may in its discretion grant compensatory time to non-
exempt employees in place of cash overtime compensation, at the rate of one and
one-half hours compensatory time for each hour of overtime worked, provided
that the employee agrees in writing, before the performance of the overtime
work, to compensatory time in place of cash overtime, and provided further that
all FLSA compensatory time requirements are satisfied.  No non-exempt employee
may accumulate more than 240 hours of compensatory time.
      (2)   Exempt employees are exempt from overtime payment. However, such
employees may receive compensatory time on an hour for hour basis for hours
worked in excess of 40 hours per week, upon the approval of the supervisor,
department head or City Manager.  No exempt employee may accumulate more than
240 hours of compensatory time. Any compensatory time not used before
separation from employment shall be forfeited.
   (C)   Call-in pay. Non-exempt employees required to report to work at a time
outside the employee’s normal work day will receive a minimum of two hours pay
at one and one-half the employee’s regular rate of pay. If the call-in requires
more than two hours of work, then the employee will be paid for the hours
actually worked at one and one-half the employee’s regular rate of pay.
('97 Code, § 31.02)
   (D)   Probationary employees.
      (1)   New, rehired or promoted full-time employees will serve a one-year
probationary period of close supervision and evaluation in order to assess
their ability and adaptation. Probationary employment may be terminated at the
will and discretion of the city without advance notice.
      (2)   The city may extend an employee’s probationary period for a
specified additional period when the city determines that an extension is
necessary to thoroughly evaluate the employee’s ability to perform the full
scope of assigned duties in an effective and safe manner. In these cases, the
employee will be advised in writing of the extended duration of the
probationary period before the conclusion of the initial probationary period.
   (E)   At-will employment.
      (1)   Completion of a probationary period or conferral of regular
employee status shall not change an employee’s status as an employee-at-will,
or in any way restrict the city’s right to terminate such employee or change
the terms and conditions of employment. Nothing contained in this or other city
policies or other material provided to employees in connection with their
employment shall require the city to have just cause to terminate that
employee, or otherwise restrict the city’s right to terminate an employee at
any time for any lawful reason.
      (2)   An employee’s at-will status shall not be modified by any
statements made by any person or by any writing available to employees or
applicants in connection with their employment. No document, whether singly or
combined, shall create an express or implied contract concerning any terms or
conditions of employment.

§ 36.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   Each taxpayer who engages in business or other activity or whose
qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other taxable income is
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, and every resident shall make and
file a return on or before April 15 of each year, whether or not a tax is due.
When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the
calendar year, the return shall be filed by the 15th day of the fourth month
from the end of such fiscal year or period. The Administrator is hereby
authorized to provide by regulation in accordance with rules and regulations
that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted
by the employer or employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation or other income of a nonresident employee, and paid by the
employer or employers to the Administrator, shall be accepted as the return
required of any nonresident employee whose sole income, subject to tax under
this chapter, is such qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation or
other income.
      (2)   The Administrator shall also have authority to require that certain
retired individuals may be exempt from this section, providing that no
reportable or taxable income exists beyond income exempt from taxation as
provided by this chapter.
   (B)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, or on a
generic form, setting forth:
      (1)   (a)   The aggregate amount of qualifying wages, commissions, other

the year, or portion thereof, covered by the return and subject to the tax
imposed by this chapter;
      (2)   (a)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on income reported;
         (b)   Any credits to which the taxpayer may be entitled under the
provisions of §§
36.06,
36.07 and
36.14 of this chapter; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator may require.
      (4)   A generic form once completed and filed must contain all of the
information required to be submitted with the city’s prescribed returns,
reports or documents, and must be in a similar format that will allow
processing of the generic forms without altering the city’s procedures for
processing forms.  The taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form must
also otherwise comply with the rules or ordinances of the city governing the
filing of returns, reports or documents.  Determination as to whether a generic
form meets this criteria shall be the responsibility of the Administrator.
   (C)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for filing of the federal income tax return (whichever occurs later).
The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the
amount of tax
shown to be due thereon by the date the return is normally due. No penalty or
interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the
final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (D)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing
thereof, pay to the Administrator the balance of tax due, if any, after
deducting:
         (a)   The amount of city income tax deducted or withheld at the source
pursuant to §
36.06;
         (b)   Such portion of the tax as has been paid on declaration by the
taxpayer pursuant to §
36.07;
         (c)   Any credit allowable under the provisions of §
36.14.
      (2)   Should the return, or the records of the Administrator, indicate an
overpayment of the tax to which the city is entitled under the provisions of
this chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any existing
liability and the balance, if any, at the election of the taxpayer communicated
to the Administrator, shall be refunded or transferred against any subsequent
liability. Provided, however, that overpayment of less than $10 shall not be
refunded.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in §§
36.11 and
36.14. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s city tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended city return showing income subject to the city tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

employs one or more persons on a qualifying wage, commission, other
compensation or other income basis shall, at the time of payment thereof,
deduct the tax of 2% from the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation
or other income earned or received by city residents regardless of where such
compensation was earned or received and shall deduct the tax of 2% from the
qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation or other income earned or
received within the city by non-residents;
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A)(1) of this section,
where such employer employs a city resident in another taxing municipality

if any, between the tax imposed by such other taxing municipality and the tax
imposed by this chapter;

quarter following such withholding, make a return and remit to the city the tax

$3,000.  Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by, or acceptable
to, the Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations. Such
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such taxes have, in fact, been withheld.

the time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
      (6)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirements to withhold
the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (B)   Such employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the city, as a trustee for the
benefit of the city and any such tax collected by such employer from his or her
employees shall, until the same is paid to the city, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer.
   (C)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the city,
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service, shall provide

the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person’s
residence.  However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and

shall be assessed, for not filing a declaration, on any resident taxpayer who
was not domiciled in the city on the first day of January of the year in which
they became subject to estimated payments, nor shall penalties or interest be
assessed on estimated payments if the taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to

§ 36.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.

recoverable. Except in the case of fraud, omission of 25% or more of income
subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, an additional assessment
shall not be made after three years from the time the return was due or filed,
whichever is later.  In the case of fraud, omission of 25% or more of income
subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all additional assessments
shall be made and all prosecutions to recover the city’s income taxes and

   (B)   Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or
charged with, the responsibility of filing the return and making payments for a

the officers’ or employees’ liability for a prior failure of such business to
file a return or pay the taxes due.

is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months after final determination of the federal
tax liability, whichever is later.
   (D)   Amounts of less than $10 shall not be collected or refunded.

appeal has filed with the city the required return or other documents
concerning the obligation at issue.  The appeal shall be in writing and shall
state why the decision should be deemed incorrect or unlawful. The Board shall,
on hearing, have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify any such ruling or

hereof, shall not be required by this chapter to pay a total municipal income

acknowledged liability for, a municipal income tax in another municipality on
the same income taxable under this chapter, and such other municipality does
not allow a credit to its nonresidents, such city resident may claim a credit
of the amount of such tax paid to such other municipality, but not in excess of
the tax assessed by this chapter.

to every taxpayer who works in a joint economic development zone created under

this chapter on such income earned in such joint economic development zone or
joint economic development district where such tax is paid.

§ 51.18  ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Discontinuation of service.  When an actual or threatened discharge
presents a substantial danger to the health of persons or the environment,
interferes with the operation of the wastewater system or violates any
provision of these regulations, the department may discontinue wastewater
treatment service or take any other lawful means to effect the abatement of any
danger.
   (B)   Notification of violation.  Whenever the department finds that any
user has violated any provision of these regulations, the engineer shall notify
the user stating the nature of the alleged violation. If a user who has been
notified to cease wastewater discharges fails to comply within the time
specified by the engineer, the department shall discontinue wastewater
treatment service by suspending water service or other appropriate means.
   (C)   Show cause hearing.  After receipt of notification to cease wastewater
discharges or to abate any substantial danger to the health of persons or the
environment, the user has the right to request a hearing before the department.
If a hearing is requested, the department shall serve the user with a written
notice specifying the time and place of the hearing.
   (D)   Right of appeal.
      (1)   Any decision rendered by the department can be appealed in writing
within 15 days to the Health Officer. The written request shall state the
reasons for the appeal and specify what remedies are sought.
      (2)   The Health Officer shall, within ten days after receipt of the
written appeal notice, hold a hearing and decide the question. The hearing
shall include testimony from all concerned persons. The Health Officer shall
render a written decision within five days after completion of the hearing.
      (3)   Within 15 days of receipt of the Health Officer's decision, the
user may appeal to the Board of Health of the city. The written appeal notice
shall be directed to the Health Officer who shall promptly transmit the appeal
to the Board of Health. Upon giving not less than five business days' written
notice to the appellant, a hearing shall be held before the Board of Health.
After the hearing, the Board may, by a majority vote, affirm, reject or modify
the decision of the Health Officer. The decision of the Board shall be made in
writing within seven business days after the hearing and shall be final, except
that further recourse may be had through statutory procedures.
   (E)   Reinstatement of service.  Prior to reinstatement of wastewater
treatment service, all cost and expense incident to the city's discontinuation
of service shall be borne by the user. The department shall reinstate service
upon proof acceptable to the city that the noncomplying discharge condition has
been eliminated.
   (F)   Termination of service.  The department may terminate wastewater
treatment service to any user who fails to do the following:
      (1)   Report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his or
her discharge requested by the engineer.
      (2)   Permit reasonable access to his or her premises by department
personnel for the purpose of inspection or monitoring.
      (3)   Comply with any provision of these regulations.
      (4)   Comply with the conditions of any order issued by city, state or
federal officials with respect to these regulations.
   (G)   Annual publication.  Annually the engineer shall publish a list of all
dischargers or significant industrial users which at any time during the
previous 12 months were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment requirements. For the purpose of this provision, an industrial
user is in significant noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the
following criteria.
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit
for the same pollutant parameter.
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of all the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken
during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum
limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oil and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).  Chronic
and technical review criteria apply to SIUs but other SNC criteria can be
grounds for finding a non-SIU in SNC.  The chronic and technical review
criteria are clarified as being applicable to each of an SIU’s permitted
monitoring points.  The chronic and technical review criteria apply to
violations of instantaneous limits.  Violations of instantaneous limits or
narrative standards that cause pass-through or interference are SNC.  SNC
criterion for violations that adversely affect the operation or iimplementation
of the pretreatemtn program include violations of BMPs.
      (3)   Any other violations of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum or longer term average) that the engineer determines has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public).
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
of human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule data, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance.
      (6)   Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required
reports such as Baseline Monitoring Reports, 90-day Compliance Reports,
Periodic Self-monitoring Reports and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules.
      (7)   Failure to report noncompliance.
      (8)   Any other violation or group of violations which the engineer
determines will or has adversely affected the operation or implementation of
the city's pretreatment program.
   (H)   Schedules of compliance.  When, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
it is necessary for industrial users to install technology or provide
additional operation and maintenance (O and M) to meet any condition of this
chapter, the Superintendent shall require the development of the shortest
schedule by which the industrial user will provide this additional technology
or O and M.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events. Under no
circumstances shall any increment exceed nine months.
      (2)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report
to the engineer including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on that date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with the increment of progress, the reason for delay and the
steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the schedule established.
   (I)   Remedies non-exclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. The city is authorized to develop
and implement an enforcement response plan, which is titled “City of Piqua
Industrial Pretreatment Enforcement Procedures,” which is available at the
wastewater treatment plant. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will
generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan. However,
the Superintendent may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take more
than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

§ 51.47  RESPONSIBILITY FOR COST.
   (A)   All cost and expense incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer and lateral shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. The owner of premises
served by a sewer shall be responsible for the operation, cleaning,
maintenance, repair and reconstruction of the building sewer from the building
to the point of connection with the public sewer.
   (B)   Sewer main extensions, when constructed, shall be to the
specifications of, and at no cost to the city. Waiver of the above minimum size
requirements shall be considered by the City Commission upon request of the
developer and recommendation of the City Engineer or his designee.
   (C)   The developer or owners of benefitted property shall pay 100% of the
cost of installation of the required minimum size sewer mains and
appurtenances. Sizing required by the wastewater system in excess of the
minimums will be at the cost of the wastewater system.
   (D)   (1)   Although the developer and/or owner is responsible for 100% of
the cost for the construction of a new sewer main, the party who paid the
construction costs may receive a prorated reimbursement for up to a ten year
period commencing on the date the city accepts ownership of the sewer main. The
reimbursement shall be from the new customer who will be serviced by the sewer
main.
      (2)   The prorated reimbursement of the costs for the sewer main
construction shall be based on lineal footage of the property frontage based on
the formula defined herein. The total cost of the sewer main construction shall
be divided by the lineal frontage to determine the cost per lineal foot. Said
cost for per lineal foot shall then be multiplied by the total lineal frontage
for the amount of reimbursement.
   Example:   Total cost of sewer main: $100,000
            Total L.F.: 500
            $100,000 / 500 = $200 per L.F.
            $200 x 75 L.F. (frontage) = $15,000 prorated reimbursement
      (3)   The city shall not be held in any way responsible for any
consumer's amount of prorated reimbursement should the reimbursement not be
paid. Failure to pay would be subject to a civil action between the developer
seeking reimbursement and the consumer who failed to pay.
   (E)   Sewer mains will be accepted into the water system, and ownership
transferred to the city, after the project is complete, all inspections have
been completed and passed, and the final punch-list has been satisfied by the
City Engineer or his designee. Upon the city officially accepting the
completion of the sewer main project, the maintenance bond will be executed,
providing a minimum of a one-year period to ensure there is no construction or
other defaults with the sewer main.

§ 53.49  WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Water mains will be extended within and outside the corporation limits
according to the following minimum sizes.
      (1)   Residential zoned areas:  8-inch
      (2)   Commercial zoned areas:  10-inch
      (3)   Industrial zoned areas:  12-inch
   (B)   Water main extensions, when constructed, shall be to the
specifications of, and at no cost to the city. Waiver of the above minimum size
requirements shall be considered by the City Commission upon request of the
developer and recommendation of the City Manager or his designee.
   (C)   The developer or owners of benefitted property shall pay 100% of the
cost of installation of the required minimum size water mains and
appurtenances. Sizing required by the water system in excess of the minimums
will be at the cost of the water system.
      (1)   Although the developer and/or owner is responsible for 100% of the
cost for the construction of a new water main, the party who paid the
construction costs may receive a prorated reimbursement for up to a ten-year
period commencing on the date the city accepts ownership of the water main. 
The reimbursement shall be from the new customer who will be serviced by the
water main.
      (2)   The prorated reimbursement of the costs for the water main
construction shall be based on lineal footage of only the property frontage
based on the herein formula.  The total cost of the water main construction
shall be divided by the lineal frontage to determine the cost per lineal foot. 
Said cost for per lineal foot shall then be multiplied by the total lineal
frontage for the amount of reimbursement.
      Example:  Total cost of water main: $100,000
            Total L.F.:500
      $100,000 / 500 = $200 per L.F.
      $200 x 75 L.F. (frontage) = $15,000 prorated reimbursement
      (3)   The city shall not be held in any way responsible for any
consumer's amount of prorated reimbursement should the reimbursement not be
paid.  Failure to pay would be subject to a civil action between the developer
seeking reimbursement and the consumer who failed to pay. 
   (D)   Water mains will be accepted into the water system, and ownership
transferred to the city, after the project is complete, all inspections have
been completed and passed, and the final punch-list has been satisfied by the
City Engineer or his designee.  Upon the city officially accepting the
completion of the water main project, the maintenance bond will be executed,
providing a minimum of a one-year period to ensure there is no construction or
other defaults with the water main..
   (E)   Service connection fees as listed in §
53.07 shall apply as each water service is connected.

fulfill any of the obligations imposed upon him or her by these detailed system
requirements shall authorize the water system, at its option, to discontinue
service and/or cause the satisfaction of those obligations at the consumer's
expense, which shall be collected via the consumer's utility bill or certified
to the county for assessment on the consumer's tax duplicate.

   (E)   The policy of the city with regard to right-of-way is hereby declared
to be:
      (1)   To authorize any right-of-way user to utilize the right-of-way in a

reasonable rates;
      (5)   To promote cooperation among the city and permittees in the
occupation of right-of-way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during work in the right-of-way and avoid uneconomic, unneeded
and unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (6)   To ensure adequate public compensation for the regulation of the
private use of the right-of- way and the regulation thereof; and
      (7)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
right-of-way and to establish the following priority of use of right-of-way,

         (d)   General permitees shall have fourth priority; and
         (e)   Special permittees shall have fifth priority;
         (f)   Provided, however, that the Public Works Director may reasonably
require right-of- way permittees to cooperate to accommodate use by other
permittees and provided further that the Public Works Director may alter this
priority when the Public Works Director reasonably determines a deviation to be
in the public interest.
      (8)    To protect the value of private property by setting minimum
aesthetic standards for uses of public property; and
      (9)   To require underground placement of all facilities in areas with
existing underground facilities; and

facilities to be at the permittee’s cost; and
      (11)   To protect existing facilities, structures, and trees in the
public right-of-way during the installation of new underground facilities and
to assure the repair of existing underground facilities and co-existence with
new underground facilities to protect the first facilities’ usability.

including landscaping. 
   (F)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to apply the provisions of
this chapter to facilities owned or operated by the city or any of its
operations.

Penalty, see § 54.99
§ 54.06  USE OF RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   The permittee’s use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be
subordinate to the city’s use or occupation of the right-of-way.  Without
limitation of its rights, the city expressly reserves the right to exercise its
governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the city.
   (B)   The permittee shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner
which minimizes adverse impact on any public improvement, as reasonably
determined by the city. 
   (C)   The permittee shall consider any request made by the city concerning
placement of facilities in private easements in order to limit or eliminate
future street improvement relocation expenses.
   (D)   All facilities shall be located and laid so as not to disrupt or
interfere with any pipes, drains, sewers, irrigation systems, or other
structures or public improvements already installed.  In addition, the
permittee shall, in doing work in connection with its facilities, avoid, so far
as may be practicable, disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of the
streets, alleys, sidewalks or other public lands of the city.
   (E)   All facilities of the permittee shall be placed so that they do not
interfere with the use of right- of-way and public lands.  The city, through
its Public Works Director, shall have the right to consult and review the
location, design and nature of the facility prior to its being installed.
   (F)   Whenever reasonably possible, all newly constructed facilities shall
be located underground. The permittee shall comply with all requirements of the
city relating to underground facilities. 
   (G)   The permittee shall not interfere with the facilities of the other
right-of-way users without their permission.  If and when the city requires or
negotiates to have a service provider cease using its existing poles and to
relocate its facilities underground, all other service providers using the same
poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same time. 
   (H)   The Public Works Director may assign specific corridors within the
right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each
type of facility that is currently or, pursuant to current technology, the
Public Works Director expects will someday be located within the right-of-
way.  All right-of-way permits issued by Public Works Director shall indicate
the proper corridor for the right-of-way user’s facilities.  Any right-of-way
user whose facilities are currently in the right-of-way in a position at a
variance with the designated corridors shall, no later than at the time of next
reconstruction or excavation of the area where its facilities are located, move
the facilities to its assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this
requirement is waived by Public Works Director for good cause shown, upon
consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities,
public safety, user service needs and hardship to the right-of-way user.
   (I)   All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other
public improvements or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the
permittee shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the permittee at its
sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city.  Upon
determination by the Public Works Director that such repair or replacement is a
public safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall be commenced within
24 hours of notice from the city, or the Public Works Director may direct the
city to make such repair or replacement and bill the permittee for the city
cost. The Public Works Director has the authority to inspect the repair or
replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the permittee to do any
necessary additional work at the permittee’s expense.
   (J)   All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction,
installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of a
permittee’s facilities in the right-of-way shall be in accordance with
applicable federal, state and local law and regulations, including those
promulgated by national trade associations commonly associated with the service
provided by the permittee.  It is understood that the standards established in
this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or
referenced in this chapter may be in addition to or stricter than such minimum
standards.  A permittee shall not construct or reconstruct any of its
facilities located upon, over, under or within the city right-of- way without
first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to
the Public Works Director and having received a permit for such improvement. 
The Public Works Director may require that any drawings, plans and/or
specifications submitted be certified by a registered professional engineer
stating that such drawings, plans and/or specifications comply with all
applicable technical codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based
directly on nationally recognized codes, which are appropriately cited, and
attested to on the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the
organization applying for the permit.
   (K)   The permittee shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and
take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site
information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its
facilities located within the right-of-way, both underground and overhead, when
requested by the city or its authorized agent for a public improvement.  Such
location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the permittee
without any expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized
contractors.

   (B)   Each permittee shall assure that all subcontractors or others
performing any work or services in the right-of-way on behalf of said permittee
comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and said permittee shall
be responsible and liable hereunder for all actions of any such subcontractor
or others as if said permittee had performed or failed to perform any such
obligation. 
   (C)   To the extent allowed by law, the city may limit the number of right-
of-way opening permits, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, specific
local considerations such as:
      (1)   The capacity of the right-of-way to accommodate service facilities;
      (2)   The impact on the community of the volume of facilities in the
right-of-way;
      (3)   The disruption arising from numerous excavations of the right-of-
way;
      (4)   The financial capabilities of the service provider and its
guaranteed commitment to make necessary investments to erect, maintain and

      (2)   Location.
         (a)   In accordance with R.C. § 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation, the city shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100 feet or a distance equal to the width of the
right-of-way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed,
whichever is greater. The city also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Enforcing Official, clear and convincing
evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
            1.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement, if no
such pole or wireless support structure is available, then proceed to the next
preference;
            2.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley, if no such pole or
wireless support structure is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            3.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            4.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available,
then proceed to the next preference;
            5.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the city right-of-way. If no such wireless support structure is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            6.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the city right-of-way. If no such existing pole is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            7.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            8.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            9.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the city right-of-way.
         (b)  Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 750
feet from any existing small cell facility.
      (3)   Wireless facilities design.
         (a)   Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following
design standards:
            1.   Wireless support structure and any collocated antennas shall
be limited to 40 feet in height.
            2.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators.
            3.   New wireless support structures shall have the following
design elements:
               a.   Material: aluminum poles;
               b.   Color: black anodized;
               c.   Diameter: 12 inches;
               d.   Style: smooth round tapered profile;
               e.   Base: trapezoidal pedestal base on a reinforced concrete
footing/foundation pier;
               f.   Exception: If the neighborhood context would be better
served by a pole of a different material, color, style, or base as determined
by the Enforcing Official, then such design elements may be substituted with an
alternate design element. Such determination shall be based on the following
factors:
                  i.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
                  ii.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  iii.   The historical context of a district or specific site;
                  iv.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
         (b)   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
            1.   The city reserves the right to require the following: Antenna
and all associated equipment shall be concealed to the extent deemed necessary
by the Enforcing Official in response to the aesthetic context of the small
cell facility. Some possible configurations include but shall not be limited to
the following:
               a.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that
matches the color of the pole on which it is mounted and also conceals the
cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Enforcing Official may
approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting if, or approve an
alternate color, if in the Enforcing Official’s discretion, the side-mounted
antenna or alternate color would be more appropriate given the built
environment, neighborhood character, overall site appearance and would promote
the purposes of this chapter.
               b.   GPS antennas may be placed within the radome or directly
above the radome not to exceed six inches.
            2.   Each antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed six
cubic feet in volume.
            3.   All portions of a small cell facility other than an antenna
and as identified by R.C. § 4939.01(P)(2), shall not exceed 28 cubic feet in
volume per facility.
            4.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small cell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:
               a.   Not exceed 21 cubic feet in volume;
               b.   Not exceed 90 inches in height, 20 inches in width, or 20
inches in depth;
               c.   Not extend more than 24 inches away from the pole on which
it is mounted;
               d.   Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which
it is mounted;
               e.   Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
               f.   Be mounted on the side of the pole opposite the side from
which the nearest traffic lane’s direction of travel approaches the pole. The
Enforcing Official may approve an alternate mounting orientation, if in the
Enforcing Official’s discretion, the alternate mounting orientation would be
more appropriate given the built environment, neighborhood character, overall
site appearance and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
            5.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design
elements:
               a.   Material. The enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent material as determined by the Enforcing Official.
               b.   Color. The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of the small cell facility
is better suited to another color, as determined by the Enforcing Official.
               c.   Style. The enclosure shall match the style, or lack
thereof, of the pole on which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of
the small cell facility is better suited to another style, as determined by the
Enforcing Official.
               d.   Coordinated design elements. Common enclosures when located
within 3,000 feet of an existing common enclosure shall match the design
elements of the existing common enclosure unless the surrounding context of the
small cell facility is better suited to an alternate design.
            6.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless a waiver is requested and the following conditions
can be satisfied as determined by the Enforcing Official:
               a.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground
vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element
(i.e.. bus stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration.
If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Enforcing Official shall reserve
the right to require any of the following conditions:
                  i.   Concealed enclosure. All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Enforcing Official.
                  ii.   Smallest size. The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Enforcing Official.
                  iii.   Camouflage. Camouflaging elements may be required.
Such elements may include, but shall not be limited to, strategic placement in
less visible or obtrusive locations, placement within an existing streetscape
element, landscape screening, and strategic painting or coating to camouflage
such enclosure or equipment.
               b.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 36
inches.
            7.   The vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other
services on all small cell facilities collocated on new wireless support
structure installations shall be concealed within the wireless support
structure. The vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other
services on all small cell facilities collocated on existing wireless support
structure installations shall be concealed within the wireless support
structure, unless it is determined not possible by the Enforcing Official. The
vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other services on all small
cell facilities collocated on utility poles shall be mounted to the surface of
the pole within conduit.
            8.   Electric meters, telecommunications demarcation boxes,
grounding equipment, power transfer switches, and cut-off switches shall be
mounted on the same side of the pole as the small cell facilities common
enclosure and shall match the color of the small cell wireless facilities and
the color of the pole on which it is mounted. The Enforcing Official may
approve an alternate mounting orientation or color, if in the Enforcing
Official’s discretion, the alternate mounting orientation or alternate color
would be more appropriate given the built environment, neighborhood character,
overall site appearance and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
   (C)   Reservation of right-of-way. The city reserves the right to reserve
space for future public safety or transportation uses in the right-of-way or on
a wireless support structure or pole owned or operated by the city in a
documented and approved plan in place at the time an application is filed. A
reservation of space shall not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a
small cell facility. If replacement of the city’s pole or wireless support
structure is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small cell
facility and the future use, the small cell facility operator shall pay for the
replacement of the pole or wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or
wireless support structure must accommodate the future use.
   (D)   Undergrounding. Wireless support structures shall be subject to
compliance with the City of Piqua Code of Ordinances

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 56.01  PURPOSE.
   This chapter establishes a stormwater management user fee to fund and
support the city’s efforts to address the issues presented in the recital
provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase
II stormwater permit and required operation, maintenance and replacement
costs.  The user fees include general public (institutional, agency, federal,
state and local government and the like) and/or property owner user fees. The
purpose of the Stormwater Code contained in this chapter is to provide for
effective management and financing of a stormwater system utility within the
city.  To effectively accomplish the management of a stormwater utility, this
code shall:
   (A)   Provide for administration, operation, maintenance and inspection of
existing and future stormwater management facilities;
   (B)   Protect the public health, safety and welfare by providing a mechanism
for mitigating the damaging effects of uncontrolled and unplanned stormwater
runoff.
   (C)   Establish and maintain fair and reasonable stormwater management
service charges for each lot or parcel in the city which bear a substantial
relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and
facilities.
   (D)   Ensure that similar properties pay similar stormwater management
service charges which reflect each property’s quantity of impervious area,
because this factor bears directly on the quantity and quality of stormwater
runoff generated from developed areas.  Charges for single-family detached
dwelling units, two-family dwelling units and each housekeeping unit within a
multi-family dwelling unit shall reflect the relatively uniform effect that
such development has on runoff.  Charges for all other properties shall be
calculated based on their equivalency of impervious surface compared to single-
family detached dwelling units, two-family dwelling units and each housekeeping
unit within a multi-family dwelling unit.
   (E)   Provide a mechanism for consideration of specific or unusual service
requirements of some non-residential properties accruing to or from properties
as a result of providing their own stormwater management facilities.
   (F)   Provide to non-residential property owners a service charge adjustment
process to review stormwater charges when unusual circumstances exist which
alter runoff characteristics, when service varies from a normal condition or is
of greater significance than contribution to runoff.
   (G)   Utilize stormwater management funds for the construction, operation,
and maintenance of city stormwater facilities, except where activities or
facilities are clearly unusual and in excess of normal level of service city-
wide, and that developers are responsible for providing any stormwater
facilities required for their project.
   (H)   In order to maintain the effectiveness of the stormwater code, this
code shall:
      (1)   Establish a mechanism for appeals and amendments to its provisions.
      (2)   Provide for a procedure for abatement of conditions or activities
that are not in the interest of public health, safety or welfare.
      (3)   Provide for its continuous validity through severability of its
various provisions.
      (4)   Provide for penalties for violations of its provisions.
   (I)   The Stormwater Utility Department (STWUD) shall establish rules and
regulations consistent with this chapter to ensure the effective enforcement
and maintenance of the stormwater utility.
   (J)   The STWUD shall have enforcement authority for violations of this
chapter and the rules and regulations.

operator of residentially developed property and non-residential developed
property shall have imposed upon them a stormwater user fee.  The stormwater
user fee shall be a monthly service charge and shall be determined by the
provisions of this chapter and the applicable equivalent residential unit (ERU)
and ERU rate established hereunder, which provisions may be amended from time
to time in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or by resolution of
the Commission.  The established rate shall be contained within the Stormwater
Management User Fee Policy.  Effective with the initiation of the Storm Water
Utility and prior to January 1, 2014, one ERU is equivalent to $5.20. 
Effective January 1, 2014, the Storm Water Utility rate of one ERU is
equivalent to $5.70 or up to 5,400 square feet.  Effective January 1, 2015, the
effective Storm Water Utility rate will be, one ERU is equivalent to $6.20 or
up to 5,400 square feet for the year 2015.  Effective January 1, 2016, the
effective Storm Water Utility rate will be, one ERU is equivalent to $6.70 or
up to 5,400 square feet for the year 2016, and will remain at those rates till
further review.
   (B)   The City Manager shall make recommendations to the Commission to
adjust this definition of ERU from time to time by resolution to reflect
development trends within the city or further equitably divide the costs of
supporting the operation and maintenance of the stormwater system.  In
adjusting this definition, the Commission shall take into consideration the
source of the data from which the subject ERU is to be established, the general
acceptance and use of the source on the part of other stormwater systems, and
the reliability and general accuracy of the source.  The Commission may also
utilize information obtained from property tax assessor’s rolls or site
examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, and other reliable
information in order to determine impervious surface areas.
      (1)   Single-family properties shall be billed on a per unit basis at one
ERU per month and duplexes will be billed on a per unit basis of one-half an
ERU per month.
      (2)   The fee for all other properties not specified in division (B)(1)
shall be calculated based on the total impervious area of the property divided
by the then-effective average impervious area for an ERU multiplied by a rate
of one ERU per month at the rate established for an ERU.  The impervious area
estimate shall be based on ortho-rectified aerial photography and/or as-built
plans as approved through the building permit process, or other sources at the
discretion of the City Engineer.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the STWUD
shall assess the need for rate increases and report findings to the Commission.
   (C)   Rates and charges incurred under this section shall be prepared and
collected by the city in accordance with those provisions regulating the
preparation and issuance of bills for utility service.  The monies collected
under this section shall be used expressly for the benefit of the stormwater
system.
   (D)   The Commission shall yearly review the ERU and the fee assessed to
determine whether the rate and fee are sufficiently permitting the city to meet
the requirements of the NPDES permit issued by the EPA.
   (E)   A credit program shall be available to non-residential customers only
as established by the STWUD.

date charges are incurred as determined by the City Manager or the City
Manager’s designee.  The City Manager may withhold other services, including
water and electric, until such time as any outstanding charges are paid in full
or a payment schedule acceptable to the City Manager by the delinquent party is
agreed to.
   (D)   The city shall have authority to annually place tax liens on
properties in default of fees required by this chapter.  The city shall provide
notice of any intended tax liens subject to the provisions of applicable Ohio
law.  Removal of the property tax lien will only occur upon full payment of the

   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 3767.99(D))
§ 70.10  THROUGH HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

highway.  The officer removing the key shall place notification upon the
vehicle detailing his or her name and badge number, the place where the key may
be reclaimed, and the procedure for reclaiming the key.  The key shall be
returned to the owner of the motor vehicle upon presentation of proof of
ownership.

violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (4)   Except as provided in division (C)(5) of this section, a violation
of division (B) of this section is a felony and shall be prosecuted under
appropriate state law if the jury or judge as trier of fact finds by proof
beyond a reasonable doubt that in committing the offense, the offender was
fleeing immediately after the commission of a felony.
      (5)   (a)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a felony and
shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law if the jury or judge as trier
of fact finds any of the following by proof beyond a reasonable doubt:
            1.   The operation of the motor vehicle by the offender was a
proximate cause of serious physical harm to persons or property.
            2.   The operation of the motor vehicle by the offender caused a
substantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property.
         (b)   If a police officer pursues an offender who is violating
division (B) of this section and division (C)(5)(a) of this section applies,
the sentencing court, in determining the seriousness of an offender's conduct
for purposes of sentencing the offender for a violation of division (B) of this

conduct is more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense.
   (D)   In addition to any other sanction imposed for a violation of division
(A) of this section or a misdemeanor violation of division (B) of this section,
the court shall impose a class five suspension from the range specified in R.C.
§ 4510.02(A)(5). If the offender previously has been found guilty of an offense
under this section or under R.C. § 2921.331 or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, in addition to any other sanction imposed for
the offense, the court shall impose a class one suspension as described in R.C.
§ 4510.02(A)(1). The court may grant limited driving privileges to the offender
on a suspension imposed for a misdemeanor violation of this section as set
forth in R.C. § 4510.021. No judge shall suspend any portion of the suspension
under a class one suspension of an offender’s license, permit, or privilege
required by this division.

is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of- way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street, into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by

there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

(C)(3)(c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither
the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

provision of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of any provision of this code that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or non resident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this code is
substantially similar.
(R.C. § 4510.05)
   (B)   Whenever a person is found guilty of reckless operation of a motor

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on
or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from

to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.

valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §

has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the

if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).

the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear all of

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

person to be tested, as required under §73.011, shall state that the person may
have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude
the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.

municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,

shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control

      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. §4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. §4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. §4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form.  The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically stat the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated.  If you have a prior conviction of OVI,
OVUAC, or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
OVI, and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the

time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.012 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons'
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (B)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local

not exceeding the following:
      (1)   (a)   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess
and while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when 20 miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected, except
that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (B)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (B)(10) and (B)(11) of this section.  The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone.  Nothing in this
section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-

of the school's report for the parents of the school's pupils certifying that
the school meets state minimum standards for nonchartered, nontax-supported
schools and presents evidence of this filing to the jurisdiction from which it
is requesting the establishment of a school zone. SCHOOL also includes a

portion of a state highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries.  The distances in divisions (B)(1)(c)1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of
the following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most
appropriate:

lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the

each approach direction of the highway.
         (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (B)
(1)(a) and (B)(1)(c) of this section.

during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the state route.

number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the

cause shown, issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
   (B)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
   (C)   (1)   The application for a permit issued under this section shall be
in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe a
permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
      (2)   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
      (3)   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
   (D)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling permit
under division (A)(1) of this section upon application and payment of the
applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (A)(2) of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
   (E)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the vehicle
or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection
by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit.
No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
   (F)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
   (G)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
   (H)   (1)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to gross load limits.
      (2)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
      (3)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (I)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

§ 74.44  WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight
determinations.  During determination of weight by compact, self-contained,
portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
vehicles on highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of
sufficient length and width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. 
Such terrain shall be level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation
that the difference in elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not
exceed two inches and the difference in elevation between axles being weighed
does not exceed one-quarter inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle.  In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

§ 93.08  INSURANCE CLAIMS.
   Ohio R.C. § 3929.86, divisions (C) and (D) are hereby adopted. These
provisions read as follows:
   (A)   Section (C).  When the loss agreed to between the named insured or
insureds and the company or companies equals or exceeds sixty per cent of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure, the insurance company or companies, in accordance with division (F)
of Section 715.26 or division (D) of Section 505.86 of the Revised Code, shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the designated officer of the municipal
corporation or township in the aggregate two thousand dollars for each fifteen
thousand dollars, and each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or, if, at the
time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
insurance company or companies, the named insured or insureds have submitted a
contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing, or securing
the building or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate.
   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or other structure.  Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the municipal corporation or township shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms.
   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor’s signed estimate of
the costs of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure
after the transfer, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the
fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that
the municipal corporation or township has not commenced to remove, repair, or
secure the building or other structure.
   This division only applies to municipal corporations or townships that have
adopted a resolution, ordinance, or regulation authorizing the procedure
described in divisions (C) and (D) of this section and  have filed a certified
copy of the resolution, ordinance, or regulation for public record with the
superintendent of insurance, and applies only to fire losses that occur after
the filing of the certified copy.  The resolution, ordinance, or regulation
shall designate the officer authorized to carry out the duties of this section.
   (B)   Section (D).  Upon receipt of proceeds by the municipal corporation or
town ship as authorized by this section, the designated officer shall place the
proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security against the total
cost of removing, repairing, or securing incurred by the municipal corporation
or township pursuant to Section 715.261 or 505.86 of the Revised Code.
   When transferring the funds as required in division (C) of this section, an
insurance company shall provide the municipal corporation or township with the
name and address of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the municipal
corporation or township shall contact the named insured or insureds, certify
that the proceeds have been received by the municipal corporation or township,
and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
   The fund shall be returned o the named insured or insureds when repairs,
removal, or securing of the building or other structure have been completed and
the required proof has been received by the designated officer, if the
municipal corporation or township has not incurred any cost for such repairs,
removal, or securing.  However, the fund shall be returned to the named insured
or insureds no later than sixty days after the designated officer receives the
required proof.  If the municipal corporation or township has incurred any cost
for repairs, removal, or securing of the building or other structure, the costs
shall be paid from the fund, and if excess funds remain, the municipal
corporation or township shall transfer, no later than sixty days after all such
costs have been paid, the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of a municipal
corporation or township to recover any deficiency under Section 715.261 or
505.86 of the Revised Code.
   Nothing in this division shall be construed to prohibit the municipal
corporation or township and the named insured or insureds from entering into an
agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds
if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
   (C)   As provided for in this section, the designated officer for the city
shall be the Finance Director.

violation if not resolved by the property owner or used for fire prevention
education.

may be issued with a time for compliance.  If the violation is not corrected
within the allotted time frame then a citation may be issued, assessing the
$150 fine.
      (3)   Each day that a violation exists after the notice period has
expired is a separate violation and a separate notice may be issued for each
day the violation is not corrected.
   (B)   Any person receiving a notice of violation or a civil citation may
appeal administratively to the City Manager or his designee.  Said notice of

§ 115.28  SEVERABILITY.
   This chapter and each section and provision of this chapter, are hereby
declared to be independent sections and subsection and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent, the Commission of the city of, by
adoption of the legislation containing this section, hereby states that it is
the controlling legislative intent that if any provisions of said chapter, or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid,
the remaining sections or provisions and the application of such sections and
provisions to any person or circumstances other than those to which it is held
invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that such
sections and provisions would have been passed independently if such section or
provision were so known to be invalid.  The adoption of this chapter in a
single legislative act is merely for convenience.  This Commission intends that
each and every separate part hereof be severable so as to leave in effect as
much of this chapter as is not found invalid so as to provide as much benefit
to its citizens as possible while still protecting the rights guaranteed under
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The city further states
that the dispersal requirement, the location requirement, the permitting
process, for each type of sexually oriented business, permitting process for
employees, permitting process for independent contractors, regulation of permit
transfers, regulation of exhibition of sexually explicit films, videos, or
digital video discs in video booths, standards of conduct and operation
applicable to adult cabarets, regulations regarding minors, advertising and
lighting regulations, regulation of hours of operation and prohibition of
nudity at sexually oriented businesses are each intended as separate and
severable regulations of the city which would, and could, have been adopted as
separate legislative acts.

personal delivery to the applicants and permit holders affected at the business
or residential address listed on the application and addressed to the business
or applicant.  If the permit is issued to an entity, service of notice as
provided above to the service agent listed on the application shall be

on the appeal becoming final and expiration of any time period for initial

Ohio.
   (B)   HOTEL or MOTEL.   Every establishment kept, used, maintained,

motel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or

space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space
shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless

lodging, or sleeping purposes.
   (E)   OPERATOR.   The person who is the proprietor of the hotel or motel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, mortgagee in possession, or
any other capacity.  Where the operator performs his or her functions through a
managing agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the managing
agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of this section, and shall
have the same duties and liabilities as his principal.  Compliance with the
provisions of this section, by either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be in compliance by both.
   (F)   PERSON.   Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,

§ 116.02  RATE OF TAX.
   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of the
City of Piqua, Ohio for the use of the general fund of the city, there is
hereby levied a tax of 3% on all rents received by a hotel or motel for lodging
furnished to transient guests.  The tax constitutes a debt owed by the
transient guest to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the
operator as trustee for the city, or to the city.  The transient guest shall
pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or motel at the time the rent is
paid.  If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax
shall be paid with each installment.  The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel or motel.  If, for any
reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel or motel, the
Director of Finance may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the
Director of Finance.
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)

constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States.
   (B)   No exemption claimed under the above division of this section shall be
granted except upon a claim therefore made at the time rent is collected and
under penalty or perjury upon a form prescribed by the Director of Finance. 
All claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Director
of Finance.
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)
§ 116.04  PROHIBITION AGAINST FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the operator false evidence indicating that the
lodging furnished is not subject to the tax.  If the transaction is claimed to
be exempt, transient guest must furnish to the operator, and the operator must
obtain from the transient guest, a certificate specifying the reason that the
sale is not legally subject to the tax.  If no certificate is obtained, it
shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)
§ 116.05  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (A)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when occupancy
is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of occupancy
or any bill or statement or charge made for said occupancy issued or delivered
by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the operator as
trustee for and on account of the city, and the operator shall be liable for
the collection thereof and for the tax. 
   (B)   No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will
be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the
rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner wherein
after provided.
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)
§ 116.06  REGISTRATION.

operator of any hotel or motel renting lodging to transient guests shall
register said hotel or motel with the Director of Finance and obtain from him
or her a "Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate" to be at all times
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.  Said certificate shall, among
other things, state the following:
   (A)   The name of the operator;
   (B)   The address of the hotel or motel;
   (C)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (D)   "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Hotel-
Motel Tax Ordinance by registering with the Director of Finance of the City of
Piqua for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Hotel-Motel Tax
and remitting said tax to the Director of Finance.  This certificate does not
constitute a permit."
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)
§ 116.07  RECORDS, INSPECTION, DESTRUCTION.
   (A)   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging
furnished, together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be
the amount due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, and such other
pertinent documents.  If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax,
the operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the
sale was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the
transaction, if exempted for any other reason.  The Director of Finance, or any
employee authorized by the Director of Finance, is hereby authorized to examine
the books, papers, records and federal tax returns of any vendor or other
person for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter.  Every such
vendor, supposed vendor, or other person is hereby directed and required to
furnish upon written order by the Director of Finance, the means, facilities
and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby
authorized.  The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to order any person
reasonably believed to have knowledge of the facts to appear before him or her
and may examine such person, under oath, concerning any sale which was or
should have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such sale, and for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers,
records and federal tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him or
her, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever she reasonably believes such
persons have knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (B)   Such books, papers, records and other documents shall be opened during
business hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance, and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Director of Finance, in
writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by any orders
requesting that such records be kept for a longer period of time.
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)
§ 116.08  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the tenth day of the month, for the
preceding month's business, or at the close of any longer reporting period
which may be established by the Director of Finance, make a return to the
Director of Finance on forms provided by him of the total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected by transient occupancies.  All claims
for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during the
reporting period shall be filed with the report.  At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Director
of Finance.  The Director of Finance may establish shorter reporting periods
for any certificate holder if she deems it necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax, and he may require further information in the return, if
such information is pertinent to the collection of such tax.  Returns and
payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.  All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust
for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the Director of
Finance. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated
as confidential by the Director of Finance and shall not be released by her
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction to an officer or agent
of the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Miami, or the City of
Piqua for official use only.
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)
§ 116.09  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (A)   Original delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to 10% of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (B)   Continued delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittances on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal
to 10% of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition to the tax and
the 10% penalty first imposed.  An additional penalty equal to 10% of the total
tax and penalty of the previous 30-day period shall be added for each
successive 30-day period that the account remains delinquent.
   (C)   Fraud.  If the Director of Finance determines that the nonpayment of

of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties
stated in divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
   (D)   Interest.  In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator

corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required by §
116.08, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or fraudulent
return, report or statement or aid or abet another in the filing of any false
or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (B)   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make,
within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax
or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director of Finance shall
proceed in such manner as she may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his or her estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Director of
Finance shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain
upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and
payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to
make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and
assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided by this
chapter.  In case such determination is made, the Director of Finance shall
give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by
depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the
operator so assessed at his last known place of business.  Such operator may,
within ten days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said account
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.  At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be fixed.  After such hearing, the
Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.  The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is
taken as provided in §

merchandise or quits his business, the tax and penalty imposed or pursuant to
this chapter on sales made prior to that time shall become due and payable
immediately, and such person shall make a final return within 15 days after the
date of selling or quitting business.  His or her successor shall withhold a
sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of such tax and
penalties due and unpaid until the former owner produces a receipt from the Tax
Administrator showing that the taxes and penalties have been paid, or a
certificate indicating that no taxes are due.  If the purchaser of the business
or stock of goods fails to withhold purchase money he shall be personally
liable for the payment of the taxes and penalties accrued and unpaid during the
operation of the business by the former owner.
(Ord. 4-05, passed 4-4-05)
§ 116.12  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Director of Finance with
respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal
to the Income Tax Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with it within
15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.  The Income
Tax Board of Review shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and

business.  The findings of the Income Tax Board of Review shall be final and
conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of notice of hearing.  Any amount found to be due shall be

refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in division (A) of this section, but
only when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director of
Finance, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator,
establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance that the transient
guest has been unable to obtain refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.

   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (I)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section apply to a
violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015 and
apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July 16,
2015 if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section as it
existed on July 15, 2015.

§ 130.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY.  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION.  Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS.  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION.  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) 
§ 130.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 130.09  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.10  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) 
§ 130.11  ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. 
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.  An attempt
to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense
under this section.
   (F)   As used in this section, DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

§ 130.12  COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

Statutory reference:

§ 130.13  PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused's residence as described in division (B)(1)
of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person's residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person's use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person's residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution's burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (D) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. Proof of such character that an ordinary
person would be willing to rely and act upon it in the most important of the
person’s own affairs.
      REASONABLE DOUBT. Reasonable doubt is present when the jurors, after they
have carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are
firmly convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable
and common sense. The term is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14  BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”:  that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self-defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person's use of force in question.  The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15  DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.

§ 130.16  CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person's entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. 
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

internal control policy that does all of the following:
            1.   Provides for keeping detailed records as to the amount of
property acquired by the Police Department and the date property was acquired;
            2.   Provides for keeping detailed records of the disposition of
the property, which shall include, but not be limited to, both of the
following:
               a.   The manner in which it was disposed, the date of
disposition, detailed financial records concerning any property sold, and the

specific expenditure that is made in an ongoing investigation.
            3.   Complies with R.C. § 2981.13 if the Police Department has a
law enforcement trust fund or similar fund created under that section.
         (b)   The records kept under the internal control policy shall be open

under this section or R.C. §§ 2981.12 or 2981.13, shall make a reasonable
effort to locate persons entitled to possession of the property, to notify them
of when and where it may be claimed, and to return the property to them at the
earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence identifying persons entitled
to possession, it is sufficient notice to advertise in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county and to briefly describe the nature of the property in
custody and inviting persons to view and establish their right to it.
      (4)   As used in this section:
         CITIZENS’ REWARD PROGRAM has the same meaning as in R.C. § 9.92.
         LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY includes correctional institutions.
         TOWNSHIP LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY means an organized police department
of a township, a township police district, a joint police district, or the
office of a township constable.
(R.C. § 2981.11)
   (B)   Disposition of unclaimed or forfeited property.
      (1)   Unclaimed or forfeited property in the custody of the Police

shall be sold by the Division of Liquor Control if the Division determines that
it is fit for sale or shall be placed in the custody of the Investigations Unit
in the Ohio Department of Public Safety and be used for training relating to
law enforcement activities. The Ohio Department of Public Safety, with the
assistance of the Division of Liquor Control, shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 to provide for the distribution to state or local law
enforcement agencies upon their request. If any tax imposed under R.C. Title 43
has not been paid in relation to the beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol, any
moneys acquired from the sale shall first be used to pay the tax. All other
money collected under this division (B)(1)(d) shall be paid into the State
Treasury. Any beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol that the Division
determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
         (e)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from
an unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the inmates’ industrial and entertainment
fund of the institution if the sender is not known.
         (f)   1.   Any mobile instrumentality forfeited under R.C. Chapter
2981 may be given to the law enforcement agency that initially seized the
mobile instrumentality for use in performing its duties, if the agency wants
the mobile instrumentality. The agency shall take the mobile instrumentality
subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in performing its
duties. Those parts may be incorporated into any other official vehicle. Parts
that do not bear vehicle identification numbers or derivatives of them may be
sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the Director of Public Safety.

removed, defaced, covered, altered, or destroyed and that are not suitable for
police work or incorporation into an official vehicle shall be destroyed and

      (2)   Unclaimed or forfeited property that is not described in division
(B)(1) of this section or division (A)(1)(b) of this section, with court
approval, may be used by the law enforcement agency in possession of it. If it
is not used by the agency, it may be sold without appraisal at a public auction
to the highest bidder for cash or disposed of in another manner that the court
considers proper.
      (3)   Except as provided in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(5) of this section
and after compliance with division (B)(4) of this section when applicable, any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of pursuant to this section

of the municipality.
      (4)   If the property was in the possession of the Police Department in
relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens' reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools, or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. §2981.12. If
the property is to be sold under division (B) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.

§ 130.18  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C.
§§ 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §§
130.99 or
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) to (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §§ 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. §§ 2903.06, 2903.07,
2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the
operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.20  RESERVED.
§ 130.21  PAYMENT OF COST OF CONFINEMENT.
   (A)   Any person convicted of a criminal offense other than a minor
misdemeanor, and who, as a consequence thereof, is confined in the Miami County
Jail, shall reimburse the city for expenses incurred by reason of his or her
confinement, including but not limited to the expenses relating to the
provision of food, clothing, medical care and shelter.
   (B)   The Law Director is hereby authorized to institute any appropriate
civil suit in the Miami County Court of Common Pleas for recovery of the
expenses referred to in division (A) of this section, the amount of the
reimbursement to be determined by the Court pursuant to R.C. § 2929.223.

§ 130.22  SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE and VEHICLE have the same meanings
as in R.C. § 2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this Code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person’s residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person’s vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.
(R.C. §2901.09)
§ 130.99  PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor shall be guided by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor
sentencing. The overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect
the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the
offender. To achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the
impact of the offense upon the victim and the need for changing the offender’s
behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and making restitution to the victim of
the offense, the public, or the victim and the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor shall be
reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor
sentencing set forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and
not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon
the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses
committed by similar offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic
background, gender, or religion of the offender.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 or
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) or (C)(6)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, also
is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for
the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Revised Code. The offender
shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail
term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other
mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(6)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(6)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(6)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) or
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. §2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender's conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases.  The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house,
community alternative sentencing center, district community alternative
sentencing center, or other place at which the offender will serve the
residential sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house,
community alternative sentencing center, district community alternative
sentencing center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for
tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to,
hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious disease to be tested and treated
involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to  500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
involving a person who was a family or household member at the time of the
violation, if the offender committed the offense in the vicinity of one or more
children who are not victims of the offense, and if the offender or the victim
of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or person in loco parentis of
one or more of those children. This division does not limit the court in
requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any offense or in any
circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (E),
(F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to
the treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.A. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor.  A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.B.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may bring an action to do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

§ 131.19  VALUE OF STOLEN PROPERTY.

offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal

determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense.  When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense.  The value
of the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in
the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section.  While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

underlying misdemeanor offense (importuning – solicitation of a person of the
same sex to engage in sexual activity with the offender, when the offender
knows the solicitation is offensive to the other person, or is reckless in that
regard) was held unconstitutional in State v. Thompson, 767 N.E.2d 251 (Ohio

restriction on speech). For current felony provisions, see R.C. § 2907.07.

bingo session at the premises, or on the day of the week or at the time
specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(F). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,

      (5)   If the protection order violated by the offender was an order
issued pursuant to R.C. § 2151.34 or 2903.214 that required electronic
monitoring of the offender pursuant to that section, the court may require in
addition to any other sentence imposed upon the offender that the offender be
electronically monitored for a period not exceeding five years by a law
enforcement agency designated by the court.  If the court requires under this
division that the offender be electronically monitored, unless the court
determines that the offender is indigent, the court shall order that the
offender pay the costs of the installation of the electronic monitoring device

the cost of monitoring the electronic monitoring device may be paid out of
funds from the reparations fund created pursuant to R.C. § 2743.191.  The total
amount paid from the Reparations Fund created pursuant to R.C. § 2743.191 for

that must be accorded full faith a credit by a court of this state or that it
is not entitled to full faith and credit under 18 USC 2265(c).
   (D)   In a prosecution for a violation of this section, it is not necessary
for the prosecution to prove that the protection order or consent agreement was
served on the defendant if the prosecution proves that the defendant was shown
the protection order or consent agreement or a copy of either or a judge,
magistrate, or law enforcement officer informed the defendant that a protection
order or consent agreement had been issued, and proves that the defendant
recklessly violated the terms of the order or agreement.
   (E)    As used in this section, PROTECTION ORDER ISSUED BY A COURT OF
ANOTHER STATE means an injunction or another order issued by a criminal court
of another state for the purpose of preventing violent or threatening acts or
harassment against, contact or communication with, or physical proximity to
another person including a temporary order, and means an injunction or order of
that nature issued by a civil court of another state, including a temporary
order and a final order issued in an independent action or as a pendente lite
order in a proceeding for other relief, if the court issued it in response to a
complaint, petition or motion filed by or on behalf of a person seeking
protection.  The term does not include an order for support or for custody of a
child issued pursuant to the divorce and child custody laws of another state,
except to the extent that the order for support or for custody of a child is
entitled to full faith and credit under the laws of the United States.

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section
or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by

attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

§ 152.06  REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   The procedural and the substantive requirements for the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be as follows:
   (A)   Applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be filed with
the clerk of the Commission. An application shall be deemed filed on the date
received. All applications shall be in writing and shall include such
descriptions, plans, specifications and other information as may be requested
by the Commission. Failure to provide such written information as may be
requested by the Commission shall be a proper basis and reason for the denial
of a Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (B)   To guide an applicant through the rehabilitation process, the city
Rehabilitation of Historic Building Design Standards which were prepared in
accordance with the following ten standards, as developed by the United States
Secretary of the Interior, will provide the initial direction. The standards
for rehabilitation are as follows.
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own
right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical evidence rather than on conjectural designs
or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or
structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
significant archaeological resources. If the resource must be disturbed,
mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
      (10)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   (C)   The United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating of Historic Buildings (Revised
1983), and any subsequent reviews will be available to an applicant at the City
Engineer's office.

signs overhanging or projecting over public rights-of-way, provide more open
space, curb the deterioration of the natural environment, and enhance community
development by permitting signs which are of high quality and effectiveness,
and compatible with their surroundings. Specifically, it is the intent of this
subchapter to establish aesthetic standards and placement guidelines that are
acceptable to the community and provide the public with a safe and effective

§ 154.100  TEMPORARY; ATTACHED AND DETACHED SIGNS.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of this section is to recognize the rights of an
individual to display noncommercial messages protected by the First Amendment,
and to recognize the individual or entity who occasionally desires to display a

provide the time, place, and manner limitations allowing certain sign types for
these purposes. It is further intended to recognize the negative affect
temporary signs can have on the attractiveness of a community, including the
deterioration of the natural environment, the clutter temporary signs
contribute to the landscape, the distractions and obstructions this sign type
may cause to motorist, and the hazards that the aforementioned concerns may

temporary use, given the nature of the activity, its location on the property,
and its relationship to parking and points of ingress/egress.
      (2)   Compliance with other regulations.  The temporary use and all
structures associated with the temporary use shall conform to all applicable
Zoning, Building, Fire, Food Safety, and Health Code standards, except that

shall be removed from the property, and the property occupied by the temporary
use shall be restored to the conditions that existed prior to the temporary use
occurrence.
         (b)   The enforcing official may authorize an extension to the
expiration date of the temporary use upon receipt of a written request from the
property owner or the responsible party, and provided the enforcing official
determines reasonable circumstances exist to justify the request, the enforcing
official may authorize an extension of the expiration date or provide a renewal
of the permit to allow the temporary use to continue to exist until such time
the circumstances no longer justify the continuance of the temporary use.
      (5)   Traffic circulation. The temporary use shall not introduce undue
traffic congestion or accident potential with reference to the anticipated
traffic to and from the temporary use, the design of the adjacent streets,
intersections, and traffic control devices.

equipment, material, or other item incidental to the temporary use shall be
compatible in intensity, appearance and operation with surrounding land uses,
and it shall not impair the usefulness, enjoyment or value of adjacent property
due to the generation of excessive noise, dust, smoke, glare, spillover
lighting, or other forms of environmental or visual pollution.  All structures,
equipment, materials, or other items incidental to the temporary use shall be
self contained in a single structure, vehicle, or enclosure. 
      (8)    Signs and attention-attracting devices.  All signage shall conform
to § 154.100 of this chapter.

§ 154.142  BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (A)   Creation; membership; appointment.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals is continued, and members of the Board
on the effective date of this chapter shall continue to serve for the remainder

      (2)   The Board shall consist of five members, who shall be residents of
the city. The City Commission shall appoint members of the Board of Appeals and
may remove any member of the Board for cause upon written charges after public
hearing. The City Commission shall remove any member of the Board who during
his or her term changes his or her residence to outside the city. The City
Engineer shall be a nonvoting ex-officio member of the Board of Appeals.
Vacancies shall be filled by the appointing authority for the unexpired term of
the member affected. One member of the Planning Commission shall be a member of
the Board of Appeals. Board members shall serve a five-year term and shall be
eligible for reappointment. 
   (B)   Organization.  The Board of Appeals shall elect its own officers
annually and shall adopt the rules necessary to the conduct of its affairs.
Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at any other times as
the Board may determine. Three members of the Board of Appeals shall constitute
a quorum for the conducting of business. The Chairperson, or in his or her
absence, the Vice-Chairperson may administer oaths and compel the attendance of
witnesses. All meetings and records shall be open to the public and the City
Engineer shall serve as secretary.
      (1)   Any person, property owner, tenant, or any governmental officer,
department, board, or bureau may apply for exception or variance from the
strict applications of terms of this chapter, or appeal a decision of the
enforcing officer to the Board of Appeals.
      (2)   Any appeal of a ruling of the enforcing officer shall stay all
proceedings unless the enforcing officer certifies that, by reason of acts
pertaining to the matter in question, a stay may jeopardize the health, safety
or welfare of the community thereof. When the certification is made,
proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order granted by the
court of common pleas.
   (C)   Jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
be limited to the powers set forth below.
      (1)   Powers relative to errors.  To hear appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, decision, or determination made by an
administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter.
      (2)   Powers relative to variances.  To hear and decide upon petitions
for variances and, subject to the conditions and safeguards deemed appropriate
by the Board, to vary the strict application of the height, area, setback, or
parking requirements to the extent necessary to permit the owner a reasonable
use of the land in those specified instances where there are peculiar
exceptions, and unusual circumstances in connection with a specific parcel of
land, which circumstances are not generally found within the locality or
neighborhood concerned. Prior to taking action on a variance request, the Board
may hold a public hearing. Any variance granted by the Board shall become void
if within one year on the date of passage, a building permit has not been
issued and construction has not been initiated.
      (3)   Powers relative to exceptions.  Upon petition, the Board is hereby
empowered to make the following zoning or sign exceptions.
         (a)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of
a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown on record.
         (b)   To interpret the provisions of the zoning code where the street
layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map
fixing the several districts, which map is attached to and made a part of the
title.
         (c)   To reduce the parking requirements in the business or industrial
districts whenever the character of the use of building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provisions of parking facilities as required; or to alter
sign requirements of §§
154.095 through
154.107 when justified.
   (D)   Official action.
      (1)   In exercising the above-mentioned jurisdiction, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed and may make any decision as ought to be made. In
considering all appeals and petitions within its jurisdiction under this
chapter, the Board shall, before making any finding in a specific case, first
determine that the proposed change will not constitute a change in the district
map and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property, or increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the public
danger of fire and safety, or materially diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the
public health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare of the citizens of the
city. In making a determination, the Board may request information and
recommendations from any department of the city.
      (2)   Three affirmative votes shall be required for final action on any
matter acted upon by the Board.
      (3)   The Board of Appeals shall act by resolution of motion and shall
keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each
question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating these facts, and a
written statement of the facts of each appeal based on testimony and other
evidence, specifying the reason for granting or denying the variation. In the
event that the proposed variation or exception is denied by the Board, no new
request shall be made for the same or a substantially similar variance or
exception written one year of the denial thereof.

work subject to the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Certificate of Health Officer.  In every instance where a lot is not
serviced with public water or disposal of sanitary wastes by means of public

   (D)   Special permits; certificate of compliance.
      (1)   Upon completion of construction of any improvements as authorized
or required by the City Commission for any buildings or uses for which a
special permit was granted, the permittee may apply for inspection and partial
certification, and upon completion of construction of all improvements, the

which certificate shall not be issued until the enforcing officer has inspected
the premises covered by the special permit and has found that all terms,
conditions, and requirements of the special permit have been complied with.
      (2)   If the enforcing officer finds at any time that the terms,
conditions and requirements of a special permit have not been complied with, or
that any phase thereof has not been completed within the time required under
the special permit that time conforming to the time indicated on the building
permit, for the specific use, the enforcing officer shall report this fact to
the City Commission which may, after a hearing of which the permittee shall be
notified, revoke the special permit for failure to comply with the terms,
conditions, and requirements, or take any other action as it may deem necessary
to obtain compliance.
   (E)   Certificate of occupancy permit.  It shall be a violation of this
chapter to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any building or
premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure,
until an occupancy permit has been issued by the enforcing officer, stating
that the proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of
this chapter. This provision shall apply to all buildings and uses, except the
raising of crops and other agricultural uses.
   (F)   Remedies.  If any building or land is used, altered, constructed,
enlarged, or any action proposed in violation of the provisions of this chapter
or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Law Director, the enforcing
officer, any person or any property owner damaged by or subject to damage by
the violation in addition to other remedies provided by law, is hereby
empowered or authorized to institute appropriate action or proceedings to
prevent the unlawful location, erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, enlargement, change, maintenance, or use.
   (G)   Other action.  Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from
taking any other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any

of maintaining a nuisance per se.
   (I)   Fees.  Any application under this chapter for a permit, variance,
exception, special use, planned unit development or amendment shall be
accompanied by a fee as shall be specified from time to time by the City
Commission.
   (J)   Separability.  If for any reason any one or more sections, sentences,
clauses or parts of this chapter are held invalid, the judgment shall not
affect, impair, or invalidate the remaining provisions of this chapter, but
shall be confined in its operation to the specific section, sentence, clause,
or part of this chapter held invalid. The invalidity of any section, sentence,
clause, or part of this chapter in any one or more instances shall not attest
or prejudice in any way the validity of this chapter in any other instance.
   (K)   Violation.  No person, firm, or corporation shall violate any
provision of this chapter or any amendment or supplement thereto.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of Piqua, Ohio, does ordain these Floodplain Regulations.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The city has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified in §
155.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
city.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Miami County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Miami County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective August 2, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the city as required by §
155.53 Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   (B)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Municipal Government Complex at 201 West
Water Street, Piqua, Ohio.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.11  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   APPEAL.  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   BASE FLOOD.  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year. The BASE FLOOD may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual
flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).  The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT.  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR.  See “Lowest Floor” as defined in this
section.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT).  Issued by President Carter
in 1977, this order requires that no federally-assisted activities be conducted
in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas,
unless there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA).  The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      ZONE A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      ZONE AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      ZONE A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE B AND ZONE X (SHADED):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to
the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      ZONE C AND ZONE X (UNSHADED):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-
year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation plus one foot of
freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative
source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or
base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   FLOODWAY.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS.  An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).  An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR).  A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National
Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend

basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME.  A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle. For the purposes of
these regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.

land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP).  A federal program enabling
property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION.  Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the city Flood Insurance Rate Map,
November 9, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   PERSON.  Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. AGENCY does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General's Department, or any

   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR.  A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. § Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.  Also known as “Area of Special Flood Hazard”, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer
to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other federal, state or local
sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood-prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  The date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 155.59  ASSURANCE OF FLOOD-CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
155.34(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Piqua and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA, where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Divisions (A)(2)(a) and (c) through (e) of this section.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood- carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
city specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
155.34(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 155.72  APPEALS.
   (A)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action
of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (B)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.73  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set by the schedule of fees adopted by the city.
   (B)   Public hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing division (B)(1) to (11) of this section
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
§ 155.74  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (A)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

accordance with §
155.99.
(Ord. 4-11, passed 6-21-11)
