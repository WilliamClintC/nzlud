PREFACE 
    The Carson City, Nevada Municipal Code was reformatted in 2005 by the editorial staff of Book Publishing and has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 34, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 34, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2018-20, passed December 20, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 34, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 34, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 34, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No.34, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Municipal Code will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

Chapter 2.14 - CARSON CITY AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Sections: 

2.14.010 - Introduction. 
    As the demand for enhanced accountability and the increased examination of an adequate system of internal controls occurs in the public sector due to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, so does the significance and importance of an audit committee. 
    The independence and objectivity between the Carson City audit committee and the city's management team ensures that internal controls are a key management objective of the city's operation. The Government Finance Officers Association and the Institute of Internal Auditors encourage the effective use of an audit committee in the public sector and considers this committee an integral element of public accountability and governance. The Carson City audit committee plays a key role with respect to integrity of the city's financial information; its systems of internal controls, the legal and ethical conduct of management and employees, and is an invaluable tool for ensuring that those responsible for financial management (management, auditors, and governing boards) meet the respective responsibilities for internal control compliance and financial reporting. Additionally, the Carson City audit committee provides a vehicle for open communications between the board of supervisors, the city management team, internal audit, and the independent external auditors. 
(Ord. 2008-10 § 3, 2008) 
2.14.020 - Purpose of the Carson City audit committee. 
    The role of the Carson City audit committee is to maintain oversight of the auditing function, both internal and external resulting in increased integrity and efficiency of the audit processes for the city and the city's system of internal controls and financial reporting. The committee has three primary characteristics for it to successfully fill its obligations: 
1.  Independence. The Carson City audit committee will be independent both in fact and in appearance and requires processes to be in place to ensure such independence is maintained at all times. 
2.  Communication. The Carson City audit committee will maintain an open line of communication with the board of supervisors, city management, internal and external auditors; providing direction for the city's audit function and a framework of accountability. 
3.  Accountability. The Carson City audit committee contributes to the integrity of the financial reporting process and reinforces the culture of a strong system of internal controls throughout the city. 
    The Carson City audit committee shall provide oversight to the city's internal controls by assuring that the system of internal controls established by management are reviewed on a regular and systematic basis for functionality and effectiveness. The Carson City audit committee's duties shall include, but are not limited to, development of the risk assessment and annual work plan, review of all individual audit reports, review of the annual report of audits completed, review the status of corrective actions, the annual budget, and the performance of the internal auditor. Upon completion of these reviews, the Carson City audit committee will make appropriate recommendations to the board of supervisors. 
(Ord. 2008-10 § 4, 2008) 
2.14.030 - Composition of the Carson City audit committee.

c.  Public accounting, governmental accounting and auditing experience.

2.  In the event, upon audit or otherwise, it is determined by the executive director of the Carson City Convention and Visitor's Bureau that any delinquency is due to unintentional conduct on the part of the licensee, the executive director, upon prior written notice to the governing body of the bureau, may waive all or some of the delinquency imposed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and may impose a penalty of no less than ten percent (10%) or seventy-five dollars ($75.00), whichever is greater, of the delinquency.

3.  As a further means of deterring tax delinquencies, if any licensee has two (2) or more delinquencies for any calendar year, then said licensee shall be required, on or before February 1st of the year following the delinquencies, to post a bond in an amount equal to the preceding year's taxes for which the licensee is, or was, obligated.

4.  A return must be filed for each reporting period regardless of tax liability. Failure to file a return will result in a penalty of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for each return not filed.

The board may overturn or modify the fine or other disciplinary action imposed by the Hearings Officer if the board determines that the hearings officer improperly determined that the administrative citation was issued to the proper holder of the liquor license for the establishment where the criminal violation occurred or that the holder of the liquor license did not meet the duty required pursuant to Section 4.13.170 to provide continuing training to the employees of the holder of the liquor license and the criminal violation occurred nonetheless or that the fine or other disciplinary action imposed by the Hearings Officer was arbitrary or capricious. If the board sustains the imposing of the fine or other discipline, the holder of the liquor license shall pay any fine imposed within 30 days of the date the board sustains the imposition of the fine. If the holder of the liquor license fails to pay the fine within 30 days of the date the fine is sustained, the holder of the liquor license shall be notified within three business days by registered mail or personal service that they must attend a hearing before the board for a show cause hearing as to why the liquor license should not be revoked pursuant to Section 4.13.140 for failure to pay a fine issued pursuant to this chapter.

In the event the damages are of such a nature that Grantee is unable to perform such repairs, Grantee shall, upon reasonable notice of the City, reimburse the City for all costs of making such repairs. City costs include, but are not limited to, all staff time, costs incurred through a possible bid process, overtime and equipment costs. 
 SECTION 7. Relocation of Pipes and Appurtenances. 
 (a) Whenever the City reasonably determines that the relocation of a portion of the Grantee's pipes and appurtenances is necessary to accommodate any lawful construction, reconstruction, change in grade, alignment, or width of any public road, or the construction or reconstruction of drainage, flood control, sewer system in any public road or right-of-way adjacent thereto (collectively, "City facilities"), Grantee shall relocate its facilities to another location to be provided by the City in the public roads or right-of-way adjacent thereto within one hundred eighty (180) days of written notice to proceed with such relocation. 
 (b) Such relocation shall be at the expense of Grantee unless one of the following conditions applies: 
 (1) The relocation is required or requested due to the actions or inactions of any party other than the City. Under these circumstances the third party would be solely responsible for the cost of such relocation and Grantee would not be required to commence such work until such time that the third party compensates Grantee for the relocation costs in cash or other manner acceptable to Grantee. 
 (2) The installation or modification of the City facilities encroaches upon preexisting easements, rights-of-way, permits, or any other land rights or interest in land held or claimed by Grantee. Where Grantee has preexisting land rights, the City agrees to provide for replacement land rights for Grantee's relocated facilities. 
 (3) Grantee is required to relocate pipes and appurtenances within one (1) year of the relocation of such facilities paid for by Grantee. The cost of such relocation will be the responsibility of the City. 
 (c) This provision shall remain in effect only so long as a public road remains under the jurisdiction of the City. Upon the City's abandonment or vacation of any public road, the City shall reserve, at no cost to Grantee, an easement to Grantee for any of its existing pipes and appurtenances on the affected property. 
 (d) This provision shall not be construed to prohibit, restrict, or anyway interfere (i) with payment to Grantee for relocation expenses under the provision of any state, county, or federal funding or relocation program or (ii) with Grantee's ability to charge any party other than the City for the cost of any relocation. 
 (e) The City and Grantee will cooperate on the planning for the relocation and selection of a new location for any affected facilities to minimize the cost of such relocation. 
 SECTION 8. Retention of Police Powers. 
 The Board of Supervisors of Carson City may, at any time hereafter, impose pursuant to law such restrictions and limitations in addition to those incorporated herein as to the use by the Grantee of the public roads as said Board deems to be reasonably necessary to protect the health, public safety and welfare of the citizens of Carson City.

 Grantee, by its acceptance of this Franchise and as a condition thereof agrees for itself, its successors and assigns that throughout the entire term of this Franchise that it, its successors, and assigns shall and do indemnify and hold harmless and defend, not excluding its right to participate, the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, State of Nevada, the Board of Supervisors of Carson City, Nevada, and employees thereof from any and all suits, claims, damages, and judgments ensuing from injury or death to persons and property including property of Southwest Gas Corporation due to the construction, operation and maintenance of said natural gas pipes, mains, conduits, and other property or appurtenances or any other acts performed by Grantee pursuant to this Franchise within the area of Carson City. If the City decides to participate in any matter in which Grantee has agreed to defend the City, the cost of such participation shall be solely that of the City and not subject to this provision of the Franchise. 
 SECTION 10. Franchise Fee. 
 (a) Grantee, its successor and assigns, shall not be required to pay any fee for the purposes of this franchise agreement but will be subject to any business license fee as the City may establish pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada. 
 (b) Grantee shall pay the above-described business license fee to Carson City quarterly within thirty (30) days following the end of each quarter throughout the term of this Franchise. Grantee's failure to pay in a timely fashion constitutes a material breach of this Franchise and may lead to termination.

Such receipts shall exclude: (i) receipts from the interstate sale of natural gas to a provider of electric energy that holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Public Utilities Commission; (ii) receipts from the collection of the business license fee pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada; and (iii) like receipts collected from the same customer class receiving natural gas service from Grantee, if the City fails to collect the business license fee from another public utility, an alternative seller, or provider of discretionary natural gas service (or customers of such entities) providing natural gas service to such customer class within the City after Grantee has provided to the City the report required by NRS 703.191. Such fee shall be collected as provided in NRS 354.59887, including, the collection from governmental entities of the State, other than the City, who receive natural gas service within the City. The City may at any reasonable time examine the books and records of Grantee for the purpose of verifying the gross receipts.

The payment required by this section shall be credited against Grantee's business license fee obligation under Section 10(a) herein. 
 (e) Grantee shall file annually, on or before the 1st Monday of March, with the Carson City treasurer, an affidavit made by its president and secretary setting forth the gross receipts and expenses for the preceding year, and the net profits, if any, for the same period from its Franchised operations within the City.

 SECTION 12. When Franchise has no Monetary Value. 
 The acceptance of the Franchise granted in this Chapter shall be deemed to be an agreement on the part of Grantee to place no monetary value upon this Franchise for rate-making purposes nor in the event the property of the Grantee, or any of it, be obtained by the City through legal right of condemnation or by other legal means. 
 SECTION 13. Termination. 
 (a) If the Grantee shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with any of the provisions or conditions hereof, and shall not, within thirty (30) calendar days after written demand for compliance, begin the work of compliance, or after such beginning shall not prosecute the same with due diligence to completion, then the City, by its legislative body, may declare this Franchise forfeited and order the Grantee to remove its gas mains, distribution lines, supply lines, appliances and appurtenances from the public roads and may declare the maintenance of same therein a public nuisance. 
 (b) Carson City may sue in its own name for the forfeiture of this Franchise, or for any breach thereof, in the event of noncompliance by the Grantee, its successors and assigns, with any of the conditions thereof.

Sections: 

5.06.010 - Enactment of urban district franchise. 
    The franchise agreement entered into between Carson City and Sierra Pacific Power Company appearing herein as Section 5.06.020, relating to the urban district only, is hereby enacted into law. 
5.06.020 - Text of franchise. 
 "1. Sierra Pacific Power Company, a Nevada corporation, its successors and assigns, (Franchisee) is hereby granted by Carson City a franchise and rights of way upon, over, under, across and along the streets, alleys and public grounds, of Carson City, Nevada, for its or their use for the purpose of erecting, constructing and maintaining all necessary, appropriate or convenient poles, pole lines, posts, wires, transformers, guy wires, conduits, underground and otherwise, apparatus and appliances, in order to properly, successfully and conveniently construct, extend, maintain and operate an electric power transmission and distribution system or generating plant, or both, in Carson City, Nevada, for a period of THIRTY (30) years from the date of passage of this ordinance. 
 "2. Sierra Pacific Power Company shall provide the reasonable and necessary plant with all necessary appurtenances of approved construction for the full performance of its franchise duties, right and obligations under this franchise, and Sierra Pacific Power Company shall keep such plants and appurtenances, including all poles, wires, and other attachments, in good repair and all poles, towers and other superstructures shall be so placed as not to interfere with the passage of persons or vehicles or the safety of persons or property. 
 "3. All electric power lines which shall be constructed and used under and pursuant to the provisions of this franchise and in the exercise hereof shall be installed, constructed and maintained in a good and workmanlike manner and shall be maintained in compliance with all valid laws and ordinances from time to time in force, and upon such terms as may be provided by the Board of Supervisors which are not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Nevada, and the orders, rules and regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Nevada. Prior to planned major construction of any power lines smaller than 120 kV in size, or appurtenances thereto, grantee shall notify the City Engineer and shall obtain a construction permit. Major construction is defined as an overhead circuit with a capacity greater than eight (8) MVA and a length greater than one (1) thousand feet. Prior to major construction of new electric power lines and appurtenances equal to or larger than 120 kV in size, or extension or relocation of such facilities already in existence, grantee shall obtain a construction permit from the City Engineer stating that the proposed construction, extension or relocation meets with official standards established by the City for the appearance, location and safety of such facilities, and shall obtain any other permits required by City ordinance. For emergency repairs and for minor construction, extension, relocation, or other laying or using of electric power lines, appurtenances, and facilities pursuant to this franchise which require a street cut, Franchisee shall notify Carson City within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the completion of such work, normally two (2) business days, and obtain any required street cutting permits at that time without any penalty for performing work prior to obtaining the required street cutting permit. Within two (2) years of the enactment of this franchise, Franchisee shall propose to Carson City a comprehensive development plan for fulfilling its obligations under the franchise, which plan will be reviewed through the City's master planning process as a proposed element of the Carson City Master Plan. Such comprehensive plan shall include plans for the placement of electrical substations, electric transmission lines of 60 kV and higher voltage and distribution lines of a voltage less than 60 kV with a capacity greater than eight (8) MVA. When the comprehensive plan is approved as an element of the Carson City Master Plan, Franchisee shall not be required to obtain any additional permits from the City for placing any such power lines, appurtenances and facilities included in the master plan element. The Franchisee shall obtain all permits required by City ordinance for any such power lines, appurtenances and facilities not included in the approved master plan element. 
 "4. When Franchisee has obtained a street cutting permit for purposes of installing, maintaining and using said electric power lines, appurtenances, and facilities or any part thereof, the utility shall in a reasonable period of time, at its own cost and expense, place said public roads, or so much thereof as may have been damaged thereby, in as good order and condition in which they were prior to being disturbed or excavated by the Franchisee and shall otherwise comply with all conditions of the permit. 
 "5. Franchisee shall have the right of installing, maintaining and using any and all of such electric power lines, appurtenances, and facilities from time to time as may be necessary and proper. 
 "6. The installation, maintenance, operation and use of Franchisee's electrical system within the Franchise territory will be in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the placement, construction, maintenance and use of Carson City street lighting, water pipes, drains, sewers, streets, avenues, alleys, roads, traffic signal systems or other Carson City system (hereafter referred to as Carson City facilities) that have been, or may be constructed by Carson City or caused to be constructed by Carson City. Whenever Carson City reasonably determines that the relocation of a portion of Franchisee's electric facilities is necessary to accommodate installation or modification of Carson City facilities, Franchisee may be required to relocate within another location in the Franchise territory said portion of its facilities normally within one hundred fifty (150) days for low voltage (24.9 kV and below) and two hundred seventy (270) days for high voltage (60 kV and above). The City agrees to provide a substitute right-of-way. Such relocation shall be at the expense of the Franchisee unless one of the following two (2) conditions occurs: 
 a. The relocation is required or requested due to the actions or inaction of any party other than Carson City such as when a street lane is added as a condition to a Special Use Permit. In this circumstance the third party would be solely responsible for the cost of any relocation and the Franchisee would not be required to relocate facilities until such time that the third party compensates the Franchisee for the relocation costs in cash in US dollars or other manner acceptable to the Franchisee for any required relocation or provides a guarantee of payment for any required relocation that is acceptable to the Franchisee. 
 b. The installation or modification of Carson City facilities encroaches upon the preexisting easements right-of-way, or any other land rights or interests in land, held or claimed by, the Franchisee. Where Franchisee has prior existing land rights, Carson City agrees to provide for replacement land rights for the relocated facilities. 
 This provision shall cease to be applicable to any public road if and when the City shall cease to have jurisdiction over or shall cease to be obligated to maintain such public road, and nothing contained in this section shall be construed to constitute a contractual obligation of Franchisee to assume jurisdiction over or the obligation to maintain such public road. This section shall not be construed to prohibit or restrict payment by the State to Franchisee for relocation of Franchisee's facilities pursuant to NRS Chapter 408. This section shall not be construed to prohibit Franchisee from charging parties other than the City for the cost of any relocation. 
 "7. Franchisee shall, with due diligence, provide itself, at its expense, a competent electrician to cut, repair and replace wires in all cases where such cutting or repairing or replacing is made necessary by the removal of buildings or other property through the public streets or highway with cost recovery in accordance with its tariffs as approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. 
 "8. Franchisee is further hereby granted the right to trim trees along the streets, alleys and public grounds of the city and any extension thereof in order to provide and maintain a safe installation of high voltage wires necessary, convenient or useful in the operation of its said system. In so doing, Franchisee will comply with Franchisee's established tree trimming standards and provide reasonable notice to the City of the general location and time for Franchisee's tree trimming activities. 
 "9. The Franchisee shall not be required to remove existing overhead facilities and place them underground without full compensation for the costs for such activities. Compensation shall include, but not be limited to, the remaining depreciated value of the existing facilities to be removed, removal costs of existing facilities, installation of the new underground facilities, and the reconnection costs for existing customers. The Franchisee is not responsible for the conversion of the customer's panels from overhead service to underground service. Where the facilities have deteriorated and are scheduled to be replaced by the Franchisee or are to be relocated in accordance with Section 3 above, the Franchisee shall participate in the costs for installing the facilities underground in a dollar amount equal to that which the Franchisee would have incurred to replace or relocate them as overhead facilities. Where the costs for undergrounding existing overhead electric facilities will be funded by parties other than the Franchisee, the Franchisee will not unreasonably refuse to relocate those existing overhead electric facilities underground.

The keeping or raising of livestock and other farm animals as allowable under this section shall be permitted in accordance with the table of animal units and density standards described as follows: 
ANIMAL TYPE ANIMAL UNIT EQUIVALENT (A.U.E) 1-Horse, Mule or Donkey 1.00 1-Cow, Steer, or Bull 1.00 1-Pig, Llama, or Alpaca 1.00 1-Pony or Burro 1.00 1-Sheep, Goat or Mini Horse 0.50 1-Rabbit or Fowl 0.20  
    Livestock and farm animal numbers will be established at the density of one (1) animal unit for each seven thousand (7,000) square feet of lot area.

    Calculations for allowable animals may be combined to total an allowable animal unit density. For example: On a one (1) acre parcel where six (6) animal units are allowed, 3 horses (3×1.00) = 3.00 A.U.E + 4 sheep (4×0.50) = 2.00 A.U.E + 5 chickens (5×0.20) = 1.00 A.U.E, for a total of 6.00 animal unit density. 
    No person shall keep more than the allowable livestock or farm animals on any premises, or on any one (1) property without first obtaining a permit to have more than the allowed number of animals from Animal Services.

Amounts involved in thefts committed pursuant to a scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from one (1) or more persons, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense.

8.09.120 - Recording notices of violation-Purpose. 
    The Carson City board of supervisors finds that there is a need to give notice of pending enforcement actions to persons who may subsequently acquire property subject to a violation as a means to ensure the violations will be corrected. An appropriate method to accomplish this is through the issuance and recording of notices of violation. 
(Ord. 2005-18 § 3 (part), 2005).

If the enforcement official determines that good cause is shown, and an actual threat or imminent danger does not exist, or no longer exists, the enforcement official may allow the owner an additional reasonable period of time to fully correct the violation before recording the notice of violation. 
2.  Before recording, an enforcement official shall provide to the owner a notice of intent to record stating that a notice of violation will be recorded if the violation is not corrected within ten (10) business days from the date of the notice of intent to record, unless the owner requests an administrative hearing on recordation in accordance with Section 8.09.150 of the Code.

8.09.300 - Summary abatement-Procedures. 
1.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the enforcement officials shall pursue only the minimum level of correction or abatement as necessary to eliminate the imminent danger, unless pursuing only the minimum level of correction or abatement would, in the opinion of the enforcement officials, unduly increase the likelihood of the imminent danger arising again in the near future.

3.  When any such person has a legitimate need for such aerosol containers, markers or paint sticks the same may be furnished by a parent or guardian. 
4.  Such aerosol containers, markers or paint sticks are frequently stolen from retail stores by such persons. 
5.  The sale of such aerosol containers, markers or paint sticks to such persons should therefore be prohibited, and persons engaged in the retail sale of such aerosol containers and markers should be required to take reasonable steps to prevent the theft of such aerosol containers, markers or paint sticks. 
6.  The placement of graffiti often is done in connection with gang activities. 
7.  When appropriate, the courts should require those who commit acts of defacement of public or private property through the application of graffiti, to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed. 
8.  Obtaining convictions for the application of graffiti is difficult because the offense can be committed so quickly and secretively that witnesses to the act frequently are nonexistent. 
9.  The public should be encouraged, through the promise of a reward, to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting to the proper authorities the incidents of the application of graffiti which the members thereof observe.

When upon test, a meter is found to be registering more than 2 percent slow, the city may bill the customer for the amount of the undercharge based on corrected meter readings for the period the meter was in use at the customer's premises, but not to exceed the preceding 6 months, whichever is shorter. 
C.  Nonregistering Meters. When upon test, a meter is found to be nonregistering, the city may bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was nonregistering for a period not exceeding 3 months at an estimate of the consumption based upon the customer's prior use during the same season of the year or upon another customer of the same class. In all cases, if it is found that the error in a meter is due to some cause, the date of which can be fixed, the overcharge or undercharge will be computed back to but not beyond such date.

12.01.110 - Findings. 
    The Carson City board of supervisors finds that a severe water shortage exists within Carson City due to the fact of population growth and the fact that only a specified amount of water can be withdrawn from Eagle Valley. Therefore, pursuant to the police power vested in Carson City, the following sections are hereby enacted: 12.01.120 and 12.01.130. 
(Ord. 1982-8 § 2 (part), 1982). 
12.01.120 - Waste of water prohibited. 
    It is unlawful for anyone connected to the city water system to waste water. For the purpose of this section, "waste" means any excessive usage which causes water to run into or along any street, alley, storm drainage system, or into or upon another's property; provided nothing in this section shall be construed as to apply to the accidental breaking of any hose, water pipe, or other irrigation device unless same is not abated within 2 hours after personal notice of such break is given the person owning, controlling or maintaining the same or having any pecuniary interest therein. If such breaks are not repaired or the water turned off within the specified time, it shall be the duty of the utilities director or his/her designee to cause the water to be shut off, and it is unlawful for any person to again turn on such water until proper repairs have been made. If personal notice is unable to be given, the water shall be immediately shut off by the public works director or his/her designee and a notice shall be placed on the front door stating the reason(s) for said shutoff. Each and every request for the water to be turned on will require the payment of $25.00 which the city will add to the monthly bill. 
    Exception: Car washing by civic or philanthropic groups may receive written approval from the public works director or his/her designee when it is determined that said usage will not be detrimental to the city's water situation.

When the city has discovered that a customer has obtained service by fraudulent means, or has diverted the water service for unauthorized use, the service to that customer may be discontinued without notice. The city will not restore service to such customer until that customer has complied with all ordinances and reasonable requirements of the city and the city has been reimbursed for the full amount of the service rendered and the actual cost to the city incurred by reason of the fraudulent use. 
3.  Restoration of Service. 
A.  Reconnection Charge. Where service has been discontinued for violation of this chapter or for nonpayment of bills, the city shall charge $25.00 for reconnection of service during regular working hours, or $25.00 plus the actual cost incurred by the city for reconnection of service at other than regular working hours when the customer has requested that the reconnection be made at other than working hours. For restoration of service that has been discontinued for reasons other than those detailed above, the restoration charge shall be $25.00 for reconnection made during regular working hours, or $25.00 plus the actual cost incurred by the city for reconnection of service at other than regular working hours.

2.  Scheduled Interruptions. Whenever the city finds it necessary to schedule an interruption to its service, it will, within 24 hours, where feasible, notify all customers to be affected by the interruption, stating the approximate time and anticipated duration of the interruption. Scheduled interruptions will be made at such hours as will provide the least inconvenience to the customers consistent with reasonable city operations. 
3.  Apportionment of Supply During Times of Shortage. During time of threatened or actual water shortage, the city will apportion its available water supply among its customers as directed by the board. In any event, it will apportion the supply in the manner that appears most equitable under the circumstances then prevailing, and with due regard to public health and safety. 
(Ord. 1982-8 § 2 (part), 1982). 
12.01.210 - Main extensions. 
1.  General Requirement. Water main lines shall be extended by the applicant from the city's existing system to the proposed place of water use if: 
A.  Adequate fire protection can only be provided by connection to the city system, in the judgment of the city; or 
B.  The proposed place of use is an industrial or commercial type of development that is within 400 feet of the existing water system. Industrial or commercial developments utilizing over 4.0 water equivalent residential customer (WERC) values shall extend the water main a distance equal to the WERC value times 100 feet, but shall not be required to extend beyond the property line(s) farthest from the existing main, unless fire flow or pressure requirements require looping of the system; or 
C.  The proposed place(s) of residential use is (are) within the following distance(s) from the existing water system: 
(1)  A residential development utilizing from 0.5 to 4.0 water equivalent residential customer (WERC) values within 400 feet of an existing water main; or 
(2)  Residential developments utilizing over 4.0 WERCs shall extend the water main a distance equal to the WERC value times 100 feet, but shall not be required to extend beyond the property line(s) farthest from the existing main, unless fire flow or pressure requirements require looping of the system. 
D.  An industrial, commercial or residential development shall extend the main(s) the full frontage of the parcel such that the extension shall be along the full frontage of the parcel when only a portion of the property is currently served by existing mains. 
2.  Location. Wherever possible, the line shall be located in paved streets within public rights-of-way and as directed by the city. Where it is not possible to locate the line in a public right-of-way, the applicant shall provide all necessary easements for the proper operation and maintenance of the line. The location and dimensions of such easements shall be as determined by the city. Easements for mains shall be a minimum of 20 feet unless otherwise approved; an all weather maintenance road may be required by the public works director or designee for the purpose of maintenance and operation access. A minimum road width of 8 feet with 4 inches compacted aggregate base is required. 
3.  Size. The size of the line shall be as determined by the city but in no case shall the line be less than that necessary to provide adequate fire protection for the property being served. At the option of the city, the applicant may be required to have his proposal analyzed to determine system capability to provide such fire protection. Any costs for such analysis shall be borne by the applicant. In any case, the minimum water main size shall be no less than 6 inches in diameter. Mains shall be replaced along the full frontage of a parcel to be developed when existing mains do not meet the minimum size. 
4.  System Capability. Water mains shall be extended to serve a parcel when it is determined by the public works director or designee that the existing system does not have sufficient capacity to properly serve the proposed development. The public works department will identify possible locations of insufficient capacity to be addressed by the developer's engineer. The developer will be responsible for main extensions when the design capacity of existing mains is less than that required to serve a development. Mains shall be extended when existing mains are physically inaccessible to maintenance crews and equipment, as determined by the public works director or designee. Water mains shall be analyzed by the applicant to determine system capability to provide adequate flows with the analysis and calculations provided to the public works department for review and approval. Water mains shall be designed to deliver a minimum of 60 psi at the meter during peak demand periods and to provide adequate fire flow as required by the fire department. If project is an infill development where the existing system is incapable of providing 60 psi, the public works director may waive the existing requirements. Developments having a significant impact on the city water system as determined by the public works director or designee shall provide an update of the city water model at the expense of the applicant. Mains and services shall be replaced along the full frontage of the parcel to be developed when it is determined by the public works director or designee that existing mains and services do not meet the minimum fire flow or capacity requirements or are in a deteriorated condition and require replacement. Mains in a deteriorated condition shall be replaced by the developer at the expense of the public works department. Deteriorated services shall be replaced at the expense of the developer. Where an analysis of the system shows that existing portions of the system are not capable of providing adequate flow or storage, the applicant may be required to correct the deficiencies as part of the main line extension. 
5.  Participation. The applicant shall be responsible for the construction of the waterline system (or the waterline system costs) along any of the property sides or frontage of the property along which a waterline is needed for the overall completeness and continuity of the city's water main system. The applicant shall also be responsible for the necessary and required system of waterlines within the interior of the tract of land. 
    The applicant shall construct all needed waterlines (of approved sizes) within and along all sides or frontages of any piece of property prior to final approval of the development and/or the issuance of any certificate of occupancy. "Phased" construction of the waterline system may also be specifically allowed if provided for in a development agreement between the applicant and the city. In lieu of actually constructing said required waterline system, the applicant shall obtain a bond in a form acceptable to the city to fully cover 150 percent of the estimated cost of the waterline system. The applicant may also present a cash deposit, letter of credit, or similar method of financing the costs, but in the event the estimated costs shall be based upon 150 percent of city's cost of construction which would include statutorily required wage rates. 
    Whenever an applicant is required to construct a waterline from the applicant's respective property to the nearest waterline outside of the applicant's respective property, and where, in the opinion of the utilities director it is necessary that a waterline be constructed of a larger size than the minimum size needed to serve such property and that such extended waterline will be or can be used in the transmission of water from adjacent properties, the public works director shall require the applicant to construct the larger size waterline in accordance with the plans and specifications as submitted and approved by the director. Should the city require an oversized waterline the city will reimburse the applicant for the costs of the additional waterline size as long as said line is greater than 8 inches in diameter, as set forth in a waterline extension agreement or a development agreement. The applicant shall be responsible for the costs of the size of main required to serve the property or an 8-inch main, whichever is greater. 
    When the city agrees to pay for an increase in waterline size, at least 3 proposals, signed and prepared by a contractor, shall be required which show the comparable cost of the incremental increase requested by the city. The city shall select the proposal most beneficial to it. In no event shall city pay more than the lowest proposal presented. Prior to construction, the applicant shall submit 3 bids from qualified contractors attached to the application for participation, unless due to extraordinary circumstances 3 bids are not available due to specialized construction. The bids shall be itemized and include cost differentials for all items to be included in the participation. The city shall participate in the amount of the bid most beneficial to the city. The city reserves the right to reject the bids if the cost differentials exceed prices paid by the city on similar installations. Failure to provide the itemized bids will exempt the installation from participation. 
6.  Extension. If the applicant must extend the waterline system through another's property or along the frontages of various intermediate property owners, and if said properties are not currently served by the city's water system, then said intermediate and benefiting property owners shall be responsible when development commences or connection is made for a pro rata share of the costs of the waterline extension. 
    When the applicant is required to extend a waterline, he shall "front-end" the entire cost of the waterline construction and shall be responsible for the actual construction of said waterline. Any owners of properties to be served by the extended waterline will thereafter be responsible for reimbursing the first property owner for a pro rata share of the costs of the waterline system at the time said subsequent owners begin to plat, parcel, develop or build upon their parcels. 
    The pro rata shares for the applicant and all subsequent owners benefited by the extended waterline shall be determined prior to the city entering into the reimbursement agreement. The city shall collect a 15 percent administrative fee from the applicant who front-ended the waterline construction upon reimbursement by deducting the 15 percent administrative fee from the subsequent owners pro rata share prior to reimbursement to the applicant by the city. 
    The reimbursement agreement shall become null and void 10 years from the date of board of supervisors' approval. 
    In no event shall any owners of property to be served by such extended waterlines be permitted to connect thereto without first paying to the applicant or the city the pro rata share of the costs described above as well as all other fees required by the city. 
    The applicant shall submit 3 bids prior to construction from qualified contractors attached to the application for reimbursement unless due to extraordinary circumstances 3 bids are not available due to specialized construction. The bids shall be itemized and include costs for all items to be installed (i.e., pipe, valves, hydrants, manholes, etc.). Failure to provide the itemized bids will exempt the installation from reimbursement. Construction costs eligible for reimbursement are limited to engineering, contractor's bid, construction staking by an engineer or surveyor, permit, inspection and testing fees. The applicant's administration costs are not eligible for reimbursement.

12.035.030 - Purpose and policy. 
    The board finds and declares that: 
1.  Certain persons reside in Carson City on limited and fixed incomes, and those persons often have little to no opportunity to supplement such income. 
2.  Certain costs required to be paid by such persons, including costs which are charged to residential ratepayers to fund essential utility services provided by the city, continue to rise and have a disproportionate impact on those persons. 
3.  It is therefore declared to be the public policy of the city to make available certain levels of assistance, based on annual household income, to persons who reside in the city as a means to defray a portion of the costs associated with city utility services, which in turn will contribute to the health and well-being of the community. 
(Ord. No. 2018-17 , § IV, 12-6-2018) 
12.035.040 - Account for ratepayer assistance. 
1.  There is hereby created the account for ratepayer assistance within the grant fund, which must be used only for the purpose set forth in this chapter. 
2.  The account must be funded by charitable contributions. To facilitate such contributions, the director or his or her designee must include on each city utility account invoice that is issued to a residential ratepayer a statement that a monetary donation of any denomination may be made in addition to the utility payment that is regularly due for purposes of funding the account. The statement: 
(a)  Must be clear and conspicuous and specifically indicate that any donation amount may be made together with the utility payment for credit to the account, or separately in person by remitting payment directly to the Carson City Treasurer; and 
(b)  May include suggested donation amounts. 
3.  All donation amounts received must be remitted to the account by the Carson City Treasurer in accordance with regular accounting procedures. 
4.  All money from the account must be withdrawn on a first-come, first-served basis for residential ratepayers whose applications for assistance have been approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Each month, the Carson City Treasurer shall credit any remaining money in the account to the applicable city utility account invoices in ascending order of priority based on the report required to be provided by the third-party administrator pursuant to CCMC Section 12.035.080. 
5.  The account must not be supplemented by any other fund of the city. The interest earned on the money in the account, if any, must be credited to the account after deducting any applicable charges. 
6.  The creation of the account shall not be construed to create a continuing obligation of the city to provide residential ratepayer assistance, and does not establish any right or entitlement of a residential ratepayer to any money from the account. 
(Ord. No. 2018-17 , § V, 12-6-2018) 
12.035.050 - Eligibility for assistance.

Any assistance expires at the end of the applicable fiscal year for which it was approved and a new application for assistance must be submitted by residential ratepayers requesting assistance for the next fiscal year. 
3.  All applications for assistance received by the third-party administrator must be reviewed for approval or denial in time for inclusion in a report of approved applications to be provided to the Carson City Treasurer on or before June 1 of the year immediately preceding the next fiscal year in which the assistance would apply.

c.  Effluent contamination is found in the ground water or surface water. 
2.  Approval must be obtained from the health authority to construct, alter, move, or extend an individual sewage disposal system. A permit to construct, alter, move, or extend will not be issued if the nearest sewer main is within 400 feet of the property. 
a.  An exception to the requirement of sewer connection exists when the utilities director or designee has determined that sufficient grade or fall to permit drainage to the sewer system by gravity does not exist, therefore requiring the property owner to install a pump system. 
    For the purposes of this section, an individual sewage disposal system shall be deemed to have failed if: 
(a)  A condition or malfunction occurs in the individual sewage disposal system, or in the operation of the system, that threatens the public health by inadequately treating sewage or by creating a potential for direct or indirect contact between sewage and the public, including, without limitation: 
(1)  Sewage on the ground; 
(2)  A backup of sewage into a structure that is caused by the slow soil absorption of effluent; 
(3)  Sewage leaking from a septic tank, dosing tank, holding tank or collection system; and 
(4)  Effluent contaminating the ground water or surface water; or 
(b)  The operator of the system fails to comply with the requirements of the permit issued to operate the system. 
3.  In the event any owner of improved property fails or refuses to make such a connection upon being requested by the city, the city may take such lawful action as necessary to effect such connection. 
4.  The board of supervisors declares that protection of Carson City's aquifers and watersheds is in the public's health, safety and general welfare. To this end, all permits and approvals under this chapter shall reflect the protection of watersheds and wellhead protection areas in Carson City. Any new parcels created under Title 17 of the Carson City Municipal Code shall have a minimum size of 3 acres if individual sewage disposal systems (ISDS) are proposed to be utilized. In all other cases, sewage disposal shall be accomplished through the extension of sewer lines to serve the property or parcel. ISDS shall be allowed in Carson City only for individual residential lots meeting the requirements of the Carson City Municipal Code.. An exception to the requirement of a minimum parcel size of 3 acres exists if denitrification type ISDS are required to be installed for all new installations. The exception would only apply to creation of 4 or less parcels from any one parcel of land, and the minimum parcel size shall not be less than 1 acre. The use of denitrification type ISDS may not be utilized for parceling of 5 or more parcels without the approval of the utilities director. The nitrate levels discharged by the denitrification systems must meet the discharge limits allowed by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The denitrification systems must be approved by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). The applicant will be required to enter into and maintain a maintenance contract with an approved provider for the denitrification system and obtain an annual permit from the Carson City health division for maintenance and operation of the denitrification system. Prior to approval of the parceling, the applicant will be required to show that the proposed parcels meet all requirements of this chapter and the Nevada Administrative Code, Chapter 444, including but not limited to required separations from property lines, wells, watercourses, structures, and underground bedrock and water table, and minimum lot sizes due to presence of wells, city water and slope.

12.05.050 - Extension of sewer mains and laterals. 
1.  General Requirements. Sewer mains shall be extended for the following: 
A.  An industrial or commercial development within 400 feet of an existing sewer main. Industrial or commercial developments utilizing over four (4.0) sewer equivalent residential customer (SERC) values shall extend the sewer main a distance equal to the SERC value times one hundred feet (100'), but shall not be required to extend beyond the property line farthest from the existing main. 
B.  A residential development utilizing from one-half (0.5) to four (4.0) sewer equivalent residential customer (SERC) values within 400 feet of an existing sewer main. Residential developments utilizing over four (4.0) SERCs shall extend the sewer main a distance equal to the SERC value times 100 feet, but shall not be required to extend beyond the property line farthest from the existing main. 
C.  When it is determined by the utilities director or designee that the existing system does not have sufficient minimum size or capacity to properly serve the proposed development. The utilities department will identify possible locations of insufficient capacity to be addressed by the developer's engineer. The developer will be responsible for main extensions when the design capacity of existing mains is less than that required to serve the development. Mains shall be extended when existing mains are physically inaccessible to maintenance crews and equipment, as determined by the utilities director or designee. 
D.  In the event that provisions of this chapter require the owner to extend the city sewer, then sewer mains shall be extended the entire frontage(s) of the parcel unless engineering analysis determines it is physically impossible to do so or it is determined by the utilities department that further extension of the main beyond the parcel can never occur or it is not necessary for continuity of the system, or the extension of the main is to accommodate a failed septic system. In such cases, the length of extension will be determined by the utilities director or designee. An industrial, commercial or residential development shall extend the main(s) the full frontage of the parcel such that the extension shall be along the full frontage of the parcel when only a portion of the property is currently served by existing mains. Construction of a single-family residence on a parcel not associated with a subdivision, PUD or parcel map development and currently served by an existing main will not require extension of the main(s). Construction of a single-family residence on a corner lot not associated with a subdivision, PUD or parcel map development will require extension along one street frontage only. 
E.  Mains shall be replaced along the full frontage of a parcel to be developed when existing mains do not meet the minimum size per the provisions of Title 12. Mains and services shall be replaced by the developer along the full frontage of the parcel to be developed when it is determined by the utilities director or designee that existing mains and services are in a deteriorated condition and require replacement. The replacement of deteriorated mains shall be at the expense of the utilities department. 
2.  Participation. The applicant is responsible for the construction of the sewerline system (or the sewerline system costs) along any of the property sides or frontages of the property along which a sewerline is needed for the overall completeness and continuity of the city's sewer main system. The applicant is responsible for the necessary and required system of sewerline within the interior of the tract of land. 
    The applicant shall construct all needed sewerlines (of approved sizes) within and along all sides or frontages of any piece of property prior to final approval of the development or the issuance of any certificate of occupancy. "Phased" construction of the sewerline system may also be specifically allowed if provided for in a development agreement between the applicant and the city. In lieu of actually constructing said required sewerline system, the applicant shall obtain a bond in a form acceptable to the city to fully cover 150 percent of the estimated cost of the sewer system. The applicant may also present a cash deposit, letter of credit, or similar method of financing the costs, but in that event the estimated costs shall be based upon one hundred fifty percent (150%) of city's cost of construction which would include statutorily required wage rates. 
    Wherever an applicant is required to construct a sewerline from the applicant's respective property to the nearest sewerline outside of the applicant's respective property, and where, in the opinion of the utilities director it is necessary that a sewerline be constructed of a larger size than the minimum size needed to serve such property and that such extended sewerline will be or can be used in the collection of sewerage from adjacent properties, the utilities director shall require the applicant to construct the larger size sewerline in accordance with the plans and specifications as approved by the director. Should the city require an oversized sewerline, the city will reimburse the applicant for the costs of the additional sewerline size as long as said line is greater than ten inches (10?) in diameter, as set forth in a sewerline extension agreement or a development agreement. The applicant shall be responsible for the cost of the size of mains required to serve the development or a ten-inch (10?) sewer main, whichever is greater. The city shall be responsible for costs of oversizing of sewer mains greater than ten inches (10?). 
    When the city agrees to pay for an increase in sewerline size, at least three (3) proposals, signed and prepared by a contractor, shall be required which show the comparable cost of the incremental increase requested by the city. The city shall select the proposal most beneficial to it. The city reserves the right to reject the bids if the cost differentials exceed prices paid by the city on similar installations. In no event shall city pay more than the lowest proposal presented. Prior to construction, the applicant shall submit three (3) bids from qualified contractors attached to the application for participation, unless due to extraordinary circumstances three (3) bids are not available due to specialized construction. The bids shall be itemized and include cost differentials for all items to be included in the participation. Failure to provide the itemized bids will exempt the installation from participation. 
3.  Reimbursement. If the applicant must extend the sewerline system through another's property or along the frontages of another's property or along the frontages of various intermediate property owners, and if said properties are not currently served by the city's sewer system, then said intermediate and benefiting property owners shall be responsible when development commences or connection is made for a pro rata share of the costs of the sewerline extension. 
    When the applicant is required to extend a sewerline, he shall "front-end" the entire cost of the sewerline construction and shall be responsible for the actual construction of said sewerline. Any owners of properties to be served by the extended sewerline will thereafter be responsible for reimbursing the first property owner for a pro rata share of the costs of the sewerline system at the time said subsequent owners begin to plat, parcel, develop or build upon their parcels. 
    The pro rata shares for the applicant and all subsequent owners benefited by the extended sewerline shall be determined prior to the city entering into the reimbursement agreement. The city shall collect a fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee from the applicant who front-ended the sewerline construction upon reimbursement by deducting the fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee from the subsequent owners pro rata share prior to reimbursement to the applicant by the city. 
    The reimbursement agreement shall become null and void ten (10) years from the date of board of supervisors approval. 
    In no event shall any owners of the property to be served by such extended sewerlines be permitted to connect thereto without first paying to the applicant or the city the pro rata share of the costs described above as well as all other fees required by the city. 
    The applicant shall submit three (3) bids prior to construction from qualified contractors attached to the application for reimbursement, unless due to extraordinary circumstances three (3) bids are not available due to specialized construction. The bids shall be itemized and include costs for all items to be installed (i.e., pipe, manholes, etc.). Failure to provide the itemized bids will exempt the installation from reimbursement. Construction costs eligible for reimbursement are limited to engineering, contractor's bid, construction staking by an engineer or surveyor, permit, inspection and testing fees. The applicant's administration costs are not eligible for reimbursement. Upon approval of a reimbursement agreement by the board of supervisors, the agreement will be administered by the public works department. 
    Single-family homes on property zoned single-family existing at the time of application for a reimbursement agreement shall be exempt from the provisions of the agreement. When an existing single-family home is on a parcel which has adequate area to be divided per the current zoning or master plan designation of the parcel, the area which could be divided for new development will be required to be included in the reimbursement agreement. 
    The area of parcels not currently adjacent to a main shall be utilized to determine percentage of reimbursement required. 
4.  Any facilities installed pursuant to subsections 1 through 3 of this section are the property of the city upon inspection and approval of the city. 
5.  Lateral Installation, Maintenance and Reimbursement. Whenever the city, or a contractor hired by the city, extends a sewer main along the frontage of any property not connected to the city sewer system, the city may elect to install a sewer lateral or wye or both within the public right-of-way or easement adjacent to the property. If such a lateral or wye is installed by the city or its contractor, the property owner shall reimburse the city for the costs of the installation prior to connection of the property owner's sewer system to the sewer main. For the purposes of this section the costs which must be reimbursed are the costs incurred by the city at the time of the installation and include the city's final contract cost for the lateral or wye and any required pavement replacement. The payment of these costs by the owner does not affect the owner's duty to pay other regular utility connection charges and this section does not affect the duty of the owners of property to install, maintain and repair sewer laterals in the public right-of-way or easement which serve their property.

12.05.060 - Private water system meters required. 
1.  Whenever any person provides water for any real property owned by him or under his control, or whenever any person uses any such water, either or both of such persons shall maintain a meter system which shall accurately record the amount of water used. 
2.  Such records shall be open to inspection by any authorized employee of the city and shall be used as the basis for any fees or charges for the use of such sewer system as may be required by Chapter 12.03 of the Carson City municipal code.

For the purposes of this section, "limited food service" means serving pre-packaged food items, use of disposable utensils and other service ware, food items prepared and service utensils and equipment cleaned off-site at an approved location. The owner of the business shall submit a signed agreement to the Public Works Director or designee, detailing how the business satisfies the requirements for the exemption and that the owner agrees that if the food service level changes, creating the potential to discharge fats, oils, and greases to the sewer system, the owner shall install an approved grease interceptor. This agreement will be part of the owner's wastewater discharge permit. 
2.  Existing Permitted Businesses. 
a.  All businesses issued an initial wastewater discharge permit before April 1, 2008 dealing in food service that cause an increase in the amounts of fats, oils and greases discharged to the sewer system or which create excessive sewer system maintenance as a result of adding, changing or removing equipment related to the plumbing system of the location of the business or by changing food service, will require an approved grease interceptor and all other appurtenances required by the Uniform Plumbing Code. For the purposes of this section, "excessive maintenance" occurs when Public Works is required to clean any section of the sewer system every two (2) months or more due to excessive accumulations of fats, oils, and greases. 
b.  The Public Works Director or designee may exempt such a business from installing an approved grease interceptor upon sale or remodeling, if the Public Works Director or designee determines that the process of food service for this business will not change from what was originally approved or that the additional food preparation equipment and food services provided will not increase the sewer discharge of fats, oils and greases. The owner of the business shall submit a signed agreement to the Public Works Director or designee, detailing how the business satisfies the requirements for the exemption and that the owner agrees that, if the food service level changes, creating the potential for the increase of the discharge of fats, oils, and greases to the sewer system, the owner shall install an approved grease interceptor.

Typical Zoning

Land Use 

ClassificationEquivalent

Population 

Per Acre Low density residential SF12,000/ SF25,000 14 Medium density residential SF6,000/ MFD 29 High density residential MFA 60 Commercial LC/GC 12 Public (School-Park-Government) P 12 Industrial district GI/LI 12  
    A report on estimated sewage flow shall be submitted for each proposed project. When deviations from the foregoing per capita flows and occupancy rates are demonstrated, a description of the design shall be included in the report, and the department may allow such deviations. Flow generation and peaking factors may be per recommended standards for wastewater facilities (ten states standards). 
(Ord. 1995-36 § 4, 1995: Ord. 1977-12 (part), 1977). 
12.06.290 - Sanitary sewer design standards and specifications-Minimum size. 
A.  No public sewer shall be less than eight inches (8") in diameter. 
B.  No individual sewer service connection shall be less than four inches (4?) in diameter. 
(Ord. 1977-12 (part), 1977). 
12.06.300 - Sanitary design standards and specifications-Slope. 
A.  All gravity sewers must be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities for the design condition, when flowing full or half full, of not less than two feet (2') per second minimum nor more than ten feet (10') per second maximum. 
B.  Mannings formula shall be used in determining the slope, velocity, design flow and diameter using "n" coefficients for the appropriate pipe material to be used. Mannings "n" for PVC is thirteen thousandths (0.013). The minimum pipe slope for eight-inch (8?) pipe is four tenths of a percent (0.4%). 
C.  Under special conditions, when detailed justifiable reasons are given, slopes slightly less than those required for the minimum two (2)-feet-per-second velocity when flowing half full may be permitted. Whenever such decreased slopes are considered, the design engineer must furnish, with a report, his or her computations of the depths of flow in such pipes at minimum, average and daily or hourly rates of flow. It must be recognized that decreased slopes may cause additional sewer maintenance effort. 
D.  For pipe slopes less than four-tenths of a percent (0.4%), the design engineer shall place the following note on each plan/profile sheet with slopes less than four-tenths of a percent (0.4%): "The contractor shall use due care in installing sewer mains. Manhole location and invert elevations shall be laid out in the field by a professional engineer or land surveyor for slopes less than 0.4%. Sewer mains will be televised after installation; any areas of ponding water will require removal and replacement at the contractors expense." 
E.  Minimum pipe slope for dead end sewers shall be five tenths of a percent (0.5%) unless it can be shown by calculations that the velocity in the pipe is two (2) fps or greater unless waived by the utilities director or designee. 
(Ord. 1995-36 § 5, 1995: Ord. 1993-18 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 1977-12 (part), 1977). 
12.06.310 - Sanitary sewer design standards and specifications-Location. 
A.  Sewers shall be located within paved public streets and alleys except when the use of an easement is specifically approved by the department. 
B.  New sewers shall generally be located reasonably parallel to and in an area on one side of the street centerline. In existing streets, the location will be dependent on the location of existing utilities and approval by the department. 
C.  Individual sewer service connections are to be tapped into the sewer main downstream and not into the manhole unless approved by the department. 
D.  Sewer easements are to be a minimum width of twenty feet (20') for pipe, eight inches (8?) to twelve inches (12?) in diameter. Larger pipe sizes require larger easements sufficient for equipment to install, remove or maintain the pipe. The easement width shall be determined by pipe width, required trench clearance and excavated side slopes not less than 1:1 horizontal to vertical. An all weather maintenance road may be required by the utilities director or designee for the purposes of maintenance and operation access. A minimum width of eight feet (8') with four inches (4?) compacted aggregate base is required. 
(Ord. 1995-36 § 6, 1995: Ord. 1977-12 (part), 1977). 
12.06.320 - Sanitary sewer design standards and specifications-Alignment. 
A.  Horizontal. Sewer line less than twenty-four inches (24?) in diameter shall be straight between manholes and generally parallel with the street or easement centerline whenever possible. 
    Sewer lines twenty-four inches (24?) and larger may be considered for horizontal curvature when approved by the department. 
B.  Vertical. Sewer lines with vertical curvature shall not be allowed. 
(Ord. 1977-12 (part), 1977). 
12.06.330 - Sanitary sewer design standards and specifications-Manholes and laterals. 
    Standard manholes shall be installed at the end of each line with continuing stub-out; at all intersections of other sewer lines; at all changes in grade, size, or alignment. 
A.  Spacing. Maximum spacing for manholes shall be four hundred feet (400') for all lines smaller than fifteen inches (15?), and five hundred feet (500') for lines fifteen inches (15?) to twenty-four inches (24?), and six hundred feet (600') for twenty-four inches (24?) and larger. 
B.  Increasing Size. When a smaller sewer flows into a larger sewer, the invert of the larger sewer shall be lowered sufficiently to maintain the same energy gradient. An approximate method for obtaining this result is to place the crown at the same elevation for both pipes. The average energy gradient line shall be derived from anticipated full flow capacities of the pipes. 
C.  Drop Manholes. A drop connection shall be provided for a sewer entering a manhole at an elevation two feet (2') or more above the manhole invert. When the difference in elevation between the incoming sewer and the manhole invert is less than two feet (2'), the manhole invert shall be filleted and channeled to prevent deposition of solids. The drop connection shall be constructed in accordance with standard detail requirements for manhole installation. Supporting calculations for hydraulic efficiency through manholes that do not meet the above requirements shall be submitted to the department for approval. Drop manholes shall be sixty-inch (60?) diameter. 
D.  General. Manholes shall be installed at the end of all sewer mains, at all intersections of mains, and changes of grade, size, or alignment. One (1) foot stubs shall be provided at manholes for sewer mains which may be extended in the future. When extending a sewer main from an existing manhole without a stub, the existing manhole base shall be removed and replaced. Sewer mains entering manholes shall have a minimum one-tenth of a foot (0.1') of fall across the manhole and a maximum two-tenths of a foot (0.2') of fall across the manhole. Two-tenths of a foot (0.2') of fall may be exceeded when matching crowns of different pipe diameters. Manholes with the angle between the entering sewer main and existing sewer main less than seventy-five degrees (75°) shall be sixty inches (60?) diameter and maintain two-tenths of a foot (0.2') of fall. 
    Watertight manhole covers shall be used in designated floodplains and in locations where covers may be flooded by local runoff. 
E.  Dead End Sewers. Dead end sewers shall generally end in a manhole. Dry sewers which will be extended at a future date and installed without a manhole shall be certified as-built for line and grade by a Nevada professional engineer or land surveyor prior to backfill. 
F.  Each parcel shall be served by a separate sewer service lateral unless otherwise approved by the utilities department. 
G.  Sewer service laterals shall be located as per standard detail title "Typical Utility Laterals Locations," unless otherwise approved by the utilities department. All service laterals, except those located in cul-de-sacs, shall be installed perpendicular to the main. 
H.  Sewer service laterals are not to be connected to manholes without prior approval of the utilities department. 
I.  Sewer service laterals shall not be directly connected to sewer interceptors and sewer service laterals shall not be directly connected to sewer interceptor manholes without prior approval by the utilities department.

(Ord. 1996-48 § 6, 1996: Ord. 1985-15 § 7, 1985: Ord. 1984-22 § IV, 1984). 
12.06.421 - Industrial wastewater treatment surcharge. 
A.  An industrial wastewater treatment surcharge is paid the city on a monthly basis by those industrial wastewater dischargers whose contribution of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) and suspended solids (SS) create costs in excess of the value of their sewer service charges. The individual waste discharge is considered as creating cost in excess of the value of their sewer service charges when the concentration of BOD 5 , and SS exceed the following: 
BOD 5 275 mg/L SS 200 mg/L  
    The treatment surcharge is based on the appropriate city sewerage system's total maintenance, operation, and capital expenditures for providing industrial wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services as described in Section 12.06.430. The annual industrial wastewater treatment surcharge is computed by the following formula: 
Rate (in $/1000 gallons of water consumption) = 
(R 1 +((R 2 )(C 2 )(8.34)/1000)) + 
((R 3 )(C 3 )(8.34)/1000)/1000(Z) 
 Where 
 R1 = Unit costs associated with wastewater flow in $/MG per year 
 R 2 = Unit costs associated with BOD in $/1000 lb. per year 
 R 3 = Unit costs associated with SS in $/1000 lb. per year 
 C 2 = BOD concentration in mg/l 
 C 3 = SS concentration in mg/l 
 Z = The estimated ratio between wastewater flow and water consumption. 
B.  The quantity for total flow is the quantity of water measured at the water meter. Where no meter exists, the surcharge will be calculated based on nine hundred fifty (950) gallons per month per fixture unit. 
    The quantities for BOD 5 and suspended solids for certain classes of users shall be based on typical strengths as listed herein: 
BOD 5 (ppm) Suspended Solids (ppm) Wholesale bakery 1000 600 Hotel with dining facilities 500 300 Commercial laundry 450 240 Mortuaries 800 800 Restaurants 1000 300  
    The quantities of BOD 5 and suspended solids for other industrial discharges are established by sampling and analysis as specified by the ECA in the permit issued pursuant to Sections 12.06.020 through 12.06.170. 
(Ord. 1993-18 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 1985-15 § 8, 1985: Ord. 1984-22 § VI, 1984). 
12.06.431 - Establishment of unit charge rates for industrial wastewater treatment surcharge. 
A.  Unit charge rates "R 1 ," "R 2 " and "R 3 " (see Section 12.06.421) in the industrial wastewater treatment surcharge shall remain unchanged if no significant changes occur for the sewerage system by the procedure described herein. 
B.  For the sewerage system, appropriate unit charge rate parameters for flow, biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids, respectively designated "R 1 " (in dollars per million gallons per year), "R 2 " (in dollars per thousand pounds per year), and "R 3 " (in dollars per thousand pounds of suspended solids per year), shall be determined by the following method: 
1.  The total capital outlay for construction of sewerage facilities including debt principal and interest shall be estimated and distributed among the three (3) parameters in accordance with the city's determination of the percentage of the total existing capital facilities of the sewerage system predominately related to each parameter. 
2.  The total operation and maintenance costs of the system shall be distributed among the three (3) parameters in accordance with the city's determination as to which charges are predominately related to each parameter. 
3.  The sum of the capital costs and operation and maintenance costs determined for each parameter in subdivisions 1 and 2 above shall be divided by the total volume of wastewater and weight of BOD 5 and suspended solids to be treated by the sewerage system in order to obtain the unit charge rates "R 1 ," "R 2 " and "R 3 " for the system. 
(Ord. 1984-22 § VIII, 1984). 
12.06.432 - Variances. 
    In the event that the average waste characteristics and corresponding surcharge rate is disputed by a permittee, the permittee may be granted a variance by the ECA under certain conditions. A variance will be granted if all the following conditions are met: 
A.  The permittee shall apply to the ECA for a variance. The permittee shall state why a variance should be allowed. 
B.  The permittee, at his or her expense, shall provide supporting data as outlined herein or as may be requested by the ECA to show cause why a variance should be granted. 
C.  The permittee shall sample the wastewater to determine representative five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids concentrations. 
D.  Wastewater sampling must be for at least three (3) twenty-four (24) hour periods. The periods shall be representative of the nature of the business and shall be approved in advance by the ECA. Samples must be made up of a twenty-four (24) hour composite. The composite must be proportioned to flow either manually with at least one (1) sample collected hourly or by automatic integrated sampling equipment approved by the ECA. 
E.  The sampling point must be approved by the ECA. If no sampling point exists, the permittee shall construct such at his or her expense. 
F.  The analysis must be performed by a laboratory approved by the state of Nevada. 
G.  The handling, storage, and analysis of all samples must be in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for Examination of Wastes and Wastewater," as published by the APHA, AWWA and WPCF, and conform to specifications set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 40, Part 136. 
H.  Based on the analysis, a variance will be permitted if the resulting surcharge rate calculated by the ECA would result in charges fifteen percent (15%) less than those using rates adopted by the board. 
I.  The permittee shall continue to demonstrate that a variance is justified by performing the above analysis once every three (3) years or when any modifications are done to the structure requiring a building permit.

If a double check valve assembly is put below grade it must be installed in accordance with Standard Detail for Public Works Construction, Carson City section. Special consideration must be given to double check valve assemblies of the "Y" type. These assemblies must be installed on their "side" with the test cocks in a vertical position so that either check valve may be removed for service without removing the assembly. 
C.  Backflow Prevention Assembly Testing and Maintenance. 
1.  The owners of any premises on which, or on account of which, backflow prevention assemblies are installed, shall have the assemblies tested by a person who has demonstrated their competency in testing of these assemblies to the city. Backflow prevention assemblies must be tested at least annually and immediately after installation, relocation or repair. The city may require a more frequent testing schedule if it is determined to be necessary. No assembly shall be placed back in service unless it is functioning as required. A report in a form acceptable to the city must be filed with the city each time an assembly is tested, relocated, or repaired. These assemblies shall be serviced, overhauled, or replaced whenever they are found to be defective and all costs of testing, repair, and maintenance shall be borne by the water user. 
2.  The city will supply affected water users with a list of persons acceptable to the city to test backflow prevention assemblies. The city will notify affected customers by mail when annual testing of an assembly is required and also supply users with the necessary forms which must be filled out each time an assembly is tested or repaired. 
3.  Upon request the city will test a water user's backflow prevention assembly to fulfill the requirements of this chapter. The water user will be charged for the test and any maintenance found necessary to keep the assembly in working order on the next regular water bill. 
D.  Backflow Prevention Assembly Removals. 
1.  Approval must be obtained from the city before a backflow prevention assembly is removed, relocated, or replaced. 
a.  Removal. The use of an assembly may be discontinued and the assembly removed from service upon presentation of sufficient evidence to the city to verify that a hazard no longer exists or is not likely to be created in the future. 
b.  Relocations. An assembly may be relocated following confirmation by the city that the relocation will continue to provide the required protection and satisfy installation requirements. A retest will be required following the relocation of the assembly. 
c.  Repair. An assembly may be removed for repair, provided the water use is either discontinued until repair is completed and the assembly is returned to service, or the service connection is equipped with other backflow protection approved by the city. A retest will be required following the repair of the assembly. 
d.  Replacements. An assembly may be removed and replaced provided the water use is discontinued until the replacement assembly is installed. All replacement assemblies must be approved by the city and must be commensurate with the degree of hazard involved. A retest will be required following the replacement of the assembly.

Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
57.  "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only marina facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and boat building and boat repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
58.  "Governing body" means the local governing unit, county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
59.  "Hardship" is related to Variances of this chapter. The exceptional hardship would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of Supervisors requires the variance be exceptional, unusual, and pertain only to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
60.  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure or the highest ground surface next to the structure. 
61.  "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
a.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
b.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
c.  Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
d.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
62.  "Hydrodynamic loads" are forces imposed on structures by floodwaters due to the impact of moving water on the upstream side of the structure, drag along its sides, and eddies or negative pressures on its downstream side. 
63.  "Hydrostatic loads" are forces imposed on a flooded structure due to the weight of the water. 
64.  "Letter of map amendment" (LOMA) is the procedure by which any owner or lessee of property who believes his property has been inadvertently included in a Special Flood Hazard Area can submit scientific and technical information to the Federal Insurance Administrator for review to remove the property from said area. The Administrator will not consider a LOMA if the information submitted is based on alteration of topography or new hydrologic or hydraulic conditions since the effective date of the FIRM. 
65.  "Letter of map revision" (LOMR) is an official revision to a currently effective FIRM. A LOMR officially changes flood zone, floodplain and floodway designations, flood elevations and planimetric features. 
66.  "Letter of map revision (based on fill)" (LOMR-F) is a letter from FEMA stating that an existing structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by fill would not be inundated by the base flood. 
67.  "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
68.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure does not violate applicable non-elevation design requirements. 
69.  "Hazard mitigation plan" is a plan that incorporates a process whereby the potential of future loss due to flooding can be minimized by planning and implementing alternatives to floodplain management community-wide. 
70.  "Manufactured home" (mobile home) means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include "recreational vehicles". 
71.  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
72.  "Market value" is for the purposes of determining substantial improvement, market value pertains only to the structure in question. It does not pertain to the land, landscaping or detached accessory structures on the property. For determining improvement, the value of the land must always be subtracted. 
    Acceptable estimates of market value can be obtained from the following sources: 
a.  Independent appraisals by a professional appraiser; or 
b.  Detailed estimates of the structure's Actual Cash Value (used as a substitute for market value based on the preference of the community); or 
c.  Property appraisals used for tax assessment purposes (Adjusted Assessed Value: used as a screening tool); or 
d.  The value of buildings taken from NFIP claims data (used as a screening tool); or. 
e.  "Qualified estimates" based on sound professional judgment made by staff of the local building department or local or State tax assessor's office. 
    As indicated above, some market value estimates should only be used as screening tools to identify those structures where the substantial improvement ratios are obviously less than or greater than fifty percent (50%) (e.g., less than forty percent (40%) or greater than sixty percent (60%)). For structures that fall between the forty percent (40%) and sixty percent (60%) range, more precise market value estimates should be used.

79.  "One-hundred year-flood" has the same meaning as base flood. 
80.  "Physical map revisions" (PMR) is a reprinted NFIP map incorporating changes to floodplains, floodways, or flood elevations. Because of the time and cost involved to change, reprint, and redistribute an NFIP map, a PMR is usually processed when a revision reflects large scope changes. 
81.  "Ponding hazard" is a flood hazard that occurs in flat areas when there are depressions in the ground that collect "ponds" of water. The ponding hazard is represented by the zone designation AH on the FIRM. 
82.  "Post-FIRM construction" means construction or substantial improvement that started on or after the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) of the community or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later. 
83.  "Pre-FIRM construction" means construction or substantial improvement which started on or before December 31, 1974 or before the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) of the community, whichever is later. 
84.  "Principal residence" is a single family dwelling in which at the time of loss, the named insured or the named insured's spouse has lived for either (1) eighty percent (80) percent of the calendar year, or (2) eighty percent (80) percent of the period of ownership, if less than one (1) year. 
85.  "Proper openings for enclosures"(Applicable to Zones A, A1-A30, AE, AO, AH, AR, and AR Dual) relates to all enclosures below the lowest floor must be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. A minimum of two (2) openings, with positioning on at least two (2) walls, having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding must be provided. 
86.  "Public safety" relates to granting of a variance, the variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or to health of people, neighborhoods or community. 
87.  "Public nuisance" relates to any person that unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, above or below ground channel, swale, stream, canal, or basin. 
88.  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle built on a single chassis, four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty track, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
89.  "Special Flood Hazard Area"(SFHA) is Darkly shaded area on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that identifies an area that has a one percent (1%) chance of being flooded in any given year (one hundred-year floodplain). Over a thirty-year period, the life of most mortgages, there is at least a twenty-six percent (26%) chance that this area will be flooded. The FIRM identifies these shaded areas as FIRM Zones A, AO, AH, A1-A30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V, V1-V30, and VE. See Flood Insurance Risk Zone Designations 
90.  "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
91.  "Structure" is a walled and roofed building or manufactured home that is principally above ground. A structure may be a gas or a liquid storage tank. 
92.  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
93.  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction' of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either; 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure a safe living conditions, or 
b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
94.  "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
95.  "Violation" means the failure of a structure (new or substantially improved/damaged) or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development in a special flood hazard area, without an elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
96.  "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or (other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
97.  "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
98.  "2010 Carson City Control Network" means the record of survey map recorded on August 11, 2010, as map number 2749, document number 403435 in the office of Recorder, Carson City, Nevada.

( Ord. No. 2011-15, § II, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.025 - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Nevada in Nevada Revised Statutes 278.020, 244A.057, and 543.020 confers upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of Carson City does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 2005-26 § 3, 2005). 
( Ord. No. 2011-15, § II, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.030 - Findings of fact. 
1.  That the flood hazard areas of Carson City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  That these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 1986-7 § 4, 1986). 
( Ord. No. 2011-15, § II, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.040 - Declaration of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blight areas; 
7.  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and 
9.  To maintain qualifying standards for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. 1986-7 § 5, 1986). 
( Ord. No. 2011-15, § III, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.050 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
1.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Requiring that land uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
4.  Controlling, filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
5.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 1986-7 § 6, 1986). 
( Ord. No. 2011-15, § VI, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.060 - General provisions. 
    The general provisions of this chapter are as follows: 
1.  Lands to which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of Carson City. 
2.  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated March 4, 1986 and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study is on file at the Development Services - Engineering for Carson City in its offices of record for public reference and review. 
3.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction be guilty of a misdemeanor of each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Carson City from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
4.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where the ordinance codified in this chapter and another chapter, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
5.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
a.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
b.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
c.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
6.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such area will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Carson City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result reliant on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
7.  Declaration of Public Nuisance. Every new structure, building, fill, excavation or development located or maintained within any area of special flood hazard after March 4, 1986 is in violation of this chapter and considered a public nuisance per se and may be abated, prevented or restrained by action of this political subdivision. 
8.  Unlawful Acts. It is unlawful for any person to divert, retard or obstruct the flow of waters in any watercourse whenever it creates a hazard to life or property without securing the appropriate local, state and/or Federal permit(s). Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
9.  Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decisions shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

( Ord. No. 2011-15, § V, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.070 - Administration. 
    This chapter shall be administered as follows: 
1.  Establishment of Development Permit. A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established pursuant to this chapter. The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes, and for all development including fill and other activities. 
    Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Permit Center and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
a.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all residential and non-residential structures whether new or substantially improved to be located in Zones A, A1-A30, AE, and AH, if base flood elevations data are available; 
b.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any new or substantially improved non-residential structure will be floodproofed; 
c.  Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure and/or any utility meets the floodproofing criteria; 
d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. When a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development, the applicant must submit the maps, computations, and other materials required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to process a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) and pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for processing the revision; 
e.  In Zone AO the proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) and the elevation of the highest adjacent grade of all residential and nonï¿1/21/21/21/21/21/21/2residential structures whether new or substantially improved; 
f.  A technical analysis, by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada, showing the proposed development located in the special flood hazard area will not cause physical damage to any other property; and 
g.  When there is no base flood elevation data available for Zone A from any source, the base flood elevation data will be provided by the permit applicant for all proposed development of subdivisions, manufactured home and recreational vehicle parks in the special flood hazard areas, for all developments of fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less. 
h.  Basis of elevation for floodplain analysis and certificates shall use the 2010 Carson City Control Network vertical data. 
2.  Designation of the Local Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer or his designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development applications in accordance with its provisions. 
3.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Permit Review. 
(1)  Review of development applications to determine that the requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
(2)  Review of all applications to determine that the site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
(3)  Review of all development applications to determine if the proposed development in the Special Flood Hazard Area may result in physical damage to any other property to include stream bank erosion and any increase in velocities or that it does not adversely affects the flood-carrying capacity of the area where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affected" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.99 foot at any point. To assist the Local Floodplain Administrator in making this determination, the permit applicant may be required to submit additional technical analyses; 
(4)  Review of all proposals for the development of five (5) parcels or more to assure that the flood discharge exiting the development after construction is equal to or less than the flood discharge at the location prior to development; 
(5)  Review all development applications to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required; and 
(6)  Verify that vertical elevations used for any analysis or certificate is from the 2010 Carson City Control Network vertical data. 
b.  Use of Other Base Flood Data. 
(1)  When base flood elevation data has not been provided, the Local Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize the best base flood data available from any source: federal, state, or other; such as high water marks(s), floods of record, or private engineering reports, in order to administer this chapter and provide the developer with an estimated base flood elevation. 
(2)  Multiple parcels (five (5) or more) will be required to have all proposals establish the one hundred-year base flood elevation before consideration of the tentative plan for development. The Local Floodplain Administrator may, at his/her discretion, require standards exceeding those identified in this chapter. Any higher standards above those in this chapter shall be adopted by the Board of Supervisors. 
c.  Information to be Obtained and Maintained. The Local Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and retain for public inspection and have available for the National Flood Insurance Program coordinator or the Federal Emergency Management Agency representative conducting a Community Assistance Visit, the following: 
(1)  Floodplain development permits and certificates of compliance. 
(2)  Elevation Certificates with record of certification required by for Lowest Floor Certification. 
(3)  Certifications required for Nonresidential Floodproofing. 
(4)  Elevation Certificates with record of certification required for Areas Below the Lowest Floor. 
(5)  Elevation Certificates with record of certification of elevation required for Subdivisions. 
(6)  Certification required for Floodways. 
(7)  Variances issued pursuant to Variance Procedures. 
(8)  Notices required under Alteration of Watercourses. 
d.  Alteration of Watercourse. Prior to issuing a permit for any alteration or relocation of watercourse the Local Floodplain Administrator must: 
(1)  Notify all adjacent communities, Nevada's National Flood Insurance Program Coordinator, and submittal of evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency; 
(2)  Determine that the potential permit recipient has provided for maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished; and 
(3)  Have received a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) determination from FEMA. 
(4)  Provide funds from the Developer to the City for processing the Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
a.  Funds shall be in United States currency. 
b.  The amount of the funds shall be determined by an independent professional firm and shall include data collection, modeling, document research and preparation, FEMA processing fees, and filing of FEMA forms. The cost of the estimate will be split by the City and the Developer. 
c.  Once the funds are agreed upon and collected by the City, there will be no further obligation from the Developer for the LOMR. 
e.  Interpretation of Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Boundaries. The Local Floodplain Administrator or his designee may provide interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). 
f.  Maintenance of Flood Protection Measures. The maintenance of any and all flood protection measures (levees, dikes, dams, or reservoirs) will be required of the jurisdiction where such measures provide protection. If these measures are privately owned, an operation or maintenance plan will be required of the owner to be on file with Development Services. Carson City is required to acknowledge all maintenance plans by the adoption of such plans by ordinance. 
g.  Hazard Mitigation Plan. The planning commission and board of supervisors shall be responsible for reviewing all proposals for new development and shall weigh all requests for future floodplain development against the city's master plan. Consideration of the following elements is required before approval: 
(1)  Determination of whether or not a proposed development is in or affects a known floodplain. 
(2)  Inform the public of the proposed activity. 
(3)  Determine if there is a practicable alternative or site for the proposed activity. 
(4)  Identify impact of the activity on the floodplain. 
(5)  Provide a plan to mitigate the impact of the activity. 
h.  Submission of New Technical Data to FEMA. When Carson City base flood elevations either increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions, as soon as practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information becomes available, Carson City will submit the technical or scientific data to FEMA. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of the physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data.

(2)  The bottom of all such openings will be no higher than one (1) foot above the lowest adjacent finished grade. 
    Openings may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
2.  Standards for Alluvial Fans. Areas subject to alluvial-fan flooding have irregular flow paths that result in erosion of existing channels and the undermining of fill material. Those areas are identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as AO Zones with velocities. 
a.  All structures must be securely anchored to minimize the impact of the flood and sediment damage. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements must be elevated on pilings, columns, or armoured fill so that the bottom lowest floor beam is elevated at or above the depth number.

d.  All proposals for subdivision development must provide a mitigation plan that identifies the engineering methods used to: 
(1)  Protect structures from erosion and scour caused by the velocity of the flood flow; 
(2)  Capture or transport flood and sediment flow through the subdivision to a safe point of disposition. 
e.  All manufactured homes shall be prohibited within the identified hazard area except within existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions.

d.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
e.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage as set forth in this chapter. Certification of compliance shall be required of the developer and the project's engineer. 
f.  Additionally all subdivision proposals will demonstrate, by providing a detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses that the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the Special Flood Hazard Area. 
5.  Standards for Manufactured Homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within Zones A, AH, AE, and on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, on sites located: 
(1)  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(2)  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(3)  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
(4)  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood: 
a.  Shall be elevated on a permanent foundation so that the lowest floor will be elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the provisions for the Standards for Critical Structures will be elevated so that either the: 
(1)  The bottom of structural frame or the lowest point of the manufactured home is at least two (2) feet above the base flood elevation; or 
(2)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade plus freeboard and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available, new and substantially improved manufactured homes shall have the floor elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
d.  Within Zone AO, the floor for all new and substantially improved manufactured homes will be elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, or at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional. 
6.  Floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply. 
a.  If a floodway has not been designated within the special flood hazard areas established in Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it has been demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.99 foot at any point within the community. 
b.  In designated floodways located within the special flood hazard areas established in Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard encroachment shall be prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, storage of equipment or supplies, and any other development within the adopted regulatory floodway; unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). 
c.  If the above "a and b" in Floodways have been satisfied; all proposed new development and substantial improvements will comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. 
d.  No manufactured homes shall be placed in a floodway except in existing manufactured home parks or existing manufactured home subdivisions. 
7.  Standards for Recreational Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within the floodplain on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map will either; 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions, or: 
c.  Will meet the permit requirements for Permit Application and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes for Standards for Manufactured Homes. 
8.  Standards for Critical Structures. Critical structures are not authorized in a Special Flood Hazard Area, unless: 
a.  All alternative locations in Flood Zone X have been considered and rejected. 
b.  All alternative locations in Flood Zone Shaded X have been considered and rejected. 
    If the Local Floodplain Manager determines the only practical alternative location for the development of a new or substantially improved critical structure is in a Special Flood Hazard Area he must: 
a.  Give public notice of the decision and reasons for the elimination of all alternative locations. 
9.  Protection of Floodplain Storage Capacity. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the space occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely to the watercourse. 
(Ord. 2005-26 § 6, 2005: Ord. 1995-46 § 4, 1995: Ord. 1988-4 § 4, 1988: Ord. 1986-7 § 9, 1986). 
( Ord. No. 2011-15, § VII, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.090 - Variance procedures. 
    The variance procedures are as follows: 
1.  Nature of Variances. The variance criteria set forth in this chapter of the ordinance are based on the general principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the Board of Supervisors to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
    If, upon review, the Administrator of FEMA determines that community practices indicate a pattern of issuing variances that is inconsistent with the objectives of sound flood plain management, the community may be suspended from the National Flood Insurance Program. 
2.  Appeal Board. 
a.  The Board of Supervisors, as established by Title 18 of this code, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
b.  The Board of Supervisors shall hear and decide appeals, if filed within thirty (30) days from any decision or determination, when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the administrator of this chapter. 
c.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Supervisors may appeal such decision to the appropriate court as provided in the Nevada Revised Statutes. 
d.  In passing upon such applications, the Board of Supervisors shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards, etc., specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a riverfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed uses that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the city's master plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges. 
e.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that; 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates; 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Local Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Carson City Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears as an exception on the title of the affected parcel of land. 
f.  The Local Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
2.  Conditions for Variances. 
a.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Administration and Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of the ordinance have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
b.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures," as defined in Definitions, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
c.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
d.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the Board of Supervisors need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposed, but only to that elevation which the Board of Supervisors believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
e.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship," as defined in Definitions, to the applicant; 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, as defined in Definitions, "Public Safety/Nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization, as defined in Definitions of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
f.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Conditions for Variances Sub-sections a through e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
g.  Upon consideration of all the factors of Appeal Board and the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Supervisors may attach such conditions to the granting of, variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance. 
(Ord. 2005-26 § 7, 2005: Ord. 1995-46 § 5, 1995: Ord. 1986-7 § 10, 1986). 
( Ord. No. 2011-15, § VIII, 9-1-2011 ) 
12.09.100 - Map revision/amendment procedures. 
1.  Letter of Map Revision/Amendment. National Flood Insurance Program regulations provide procedures to remove property from the one hundred-year floodplain or from a Special Flood Hazard Area. Amendments and revisions to community Flood Insurance Rate Maps can not adversely impact the floodplain or floodway delineation's of the level of the one hundred-year flood. 
    There are several procedures provided whereby the Federal Insurance Administrator will review information from the community, an owner, or a lessee of property where it is believed the property should not be included in a Special Flood Hazard Area. 
    Submissions to FEMA for revisions to effective Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) by individual and community requesters will require the signing of application/certification forms. These forms will provide FEMA with assurance that all pertinent data relating to the revision is included in the submittal. They will also assure that: (a) the data and methodology are based on current conditions; (b) qualified professional have assembled data and performed all necessary computations; and (c) all individuals and organizations impacted by proposed changes are aware of the changes and will have an opportunity to comment on them. FEMA procedures permit the following types of request: 
    A request for a revision to the effective FIS information (FIRM, FBFM, and/or FIS report) is usually a request that FEMA replace the effective floodplain boundaries, flood profiles, floodway boundaries, etc., with those determined by the requester. Before FEMA will replace the effective FIS information with the revised information, the requester must: (a) provide all of the data used in determining the revised floodplain boundaries, flood profiles, floodway boundaries, etc.; (b) provide all data necessary to demonstrate that the physical modifications to the floodplain have been adequately designed to withstand the impacts of the one percent (1%) annual chance flood event and facilities will be adequately maintained; (c) demonstrate that the revised information (e.g., hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and the resulting floodplain and floodway boundaries) are consistent with the effective FIS information. 
    Requests for amendments or revisions to FEMA maps must be reviewed and submitted to FEMA by Carson City with the applicant for a map amendment or revision required to prepare all the supporting information and appropriate FEMA forms. 
    The scientific or technical information to be submitted with these requests may include, but is not limited to the following: 
a.  An actual copy of the recorded plat map bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official County Clerk or Recorder of Deeds indicating the official recordation and proper citation, Deed or Plat Book Volume and Page Number, or an equivalent identification where annotation of the deed or plat book is not the practice. 
b.  A topographical map showing; 
(1)  Ground elevation contours in relation to the NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum). 
(2)  The total area of the property in question. 
(3)  The location of the structure or structures located on the property in question. 
(4)  The elevation of the lowest adjacent grade to a structure or structures. 
(5)  An indication of the curvilinear line which represents the area subject to inundation by a base flood. The curvilinear line should be based upon information provided by an appropriate authoritative source, such as a Federal Agency, Department of Water Resources, a County Water Control District, a County or City Engineer, a Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Study, or a determination by a Registered Professional Engineer. 
c.  A copy of the FHBM or FIRM indicating the location of the property in question. 
d.  A certification by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Land Surveyor that the lowest grade adjacent to the structure is above the base flood elevation. 
e.  The completion of the appropriate forms in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Packets, Amendments and Revisions To National Flood Insurance Program Maps (MT-1 FEMA FORM 81-87 Series and MT-2 FEMA FORM 81-89 Series). 
(Ord. 2005-26 § 8, 2005: Ord. 1995-46 § 6, 1995: Ord. 1986-7 § 11, 1986).

2.  Discontinuance of Service by City. 
A.  Noncompliance with Chapter. The city may discontinue service to any customer for violation of this chapter after it has given the customer at least five (5) days written notice of such intention. 
B.  Unsafe Apparatus or Where Service is Detrimental to the City or its Customers. If any unsafe or hazardous condition is found to exist on the customer's premises, or if the use of reclaimed water thereon by apparatus, appliances, equipment or otherwise is found to be detrimental or damaging to the city or its customers, the service may be discontinued without notice. The city will notify the customer immediately of the reasons for the discontinuance and the corrective action to be taken by the customer before service can be restored. 
C.  Fraudulent Use of Service. When the city has discovered that a customer has obtained service by fraudulent means, or has diverted the reclaimed water service for unauthorized use, the service to that customer may be discontinued without notice. The city will not restore service to such customer until that customer has complied with all ordinances and reasonable requirements of the city and the city has been reimbursed for the full amount of the service rendered and the actual cost to the city incurred by reason of the fraudulent use. 
3.  Restoration of Service. 
A.  Reconnection Charge. Where service has been discontinued for violation of this chapter or for nonpayment of bills, the city shall charge twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for reconnection of service during regular working hours, or twenty-five dollars ($25.00) plus the actual cost incurred by the city for reconnection of service at other than regular working hours when the customer has requested that the reconnection be made at other than working hours. For restoration of service that has been discontinued for reasons other than those detailed above, the restoration charge shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for reconnection made during regular working hours, or twenty-five dollars ($25.00) plus the actual cost incurred by the city for reconnection of service at other than regular working hours.

2.  Scheduled Interruptions. Whenever the city finds it necessary to schedule an interruption to its service, it will, within twenty-four (24) hours, where feasible, notify all customers to be affected by the interruption, stating the approximate time and anticipated duration of the interruption. Scheduled interruptions will be made at such hours as will provide the least inconvenience to the customers consistent with reasonable city operations. 
3.  Apportionment of Supply During Times of Shortage. During time of threatened or actual reclaimed water shortage, the city will apportion its available reclaimed water supply among its customers as directed by binding contractual agreements it has with its agent users. In any event, it will apportion the supply in the manner that appears most equitable under the circumstances then prevailing, and with due regard to public health and safety. 
(Ord. 1995-50 § 1 (part), 1995). 
12.10.220 - Priority of reclaimed water service.

(Ord. 1995-50 § 1 (part), 1995). 
12.10.240 - Service connections and customer's facilities. 
1.  Service Connections. The customer will install a service connection of suitable capacity, from its reasonably adjacent reclaimed water main to a point to be determined by the city, between the existing or proposed curbline and the property line of the premises abutting upon a street or other thoroughfare, to serve a justified need of a permanent customer. The customer shall pay the established cost as detailed in this chapter. Only duly authorized contractors, after issuance of a permit, will be permitted to install a service connection. 
2.  Meters. The city will install one (1) meter incident to its furnishing reclaimed water service to the customer's premises, except in instances where the city deems that its operating convenience and necessity dictate the installation of two (2) or more meters. Under such circumstances, the city will bear the expense of the installation of additional meters. Where the installation of additional meters is requested by the customer for the customer's convenience or necessity, the customer shall bear the expense of installing such meters. In addition, where the installation of additional meters, at the customer's request, is to provide additional capacity, the customer shall pay the appropriate connection charge. 
3.  The service connections, meters, and other facilities ordered and maintained by the city and located wholly or partially upon a customer's premises are the property of the city, which has the right to repair, replace and remove them upon discontinuance of service. 
4.  The city will not be responsible for the installation and maintenance of the reclaimed water lines beyond the end of the city's service connection or meter. 
5.  The city shall have at all reasonable times the right to ingress to and egress from the customer's premises for any purpose properly connected with the service of reclaimed water to the customer. 
6.  The city will not be responsible for any loss or damage caused by any negligence or wrongful act of a customer or his authorized representative in installing, maintaining, operating or using any or all appliances, facilities, or equipment for which reclaimed water service is supplied. The customer will be held responsible for damage to the city's facilities and other property resulting from the use and operation of appliances and facilities on customer's premises, including damage caused by steam, hot water, chemicals, etc. 
(Ord. 1995-50 § 1 (part), 1995). 
12.10.250 - Service line and facilities installed by customer. 
    In special cases where extension of city's main to a point adjacent to customer's premises is not feasible, in the opinion of the city, the customer may lay service pipe, at his own expense, from point of use to point where tap can be made directly to the city's then-existing main. In some cases, the city shall be obligated to maintain reasonable pressure and flow at the point of connection to its main only, and the customer shall assume all responsibility and cost for maintenance, operation and replacement of his service line and the pressure and flow therein. If additional facilities, including but not limited to a booster pump, should be required in customer's service, above the pressure delivered normally by the city at the point of connection of the customer's line to the city's main, the customer shall provide, operate, maintain and replace such facilities, all at his own expense. The city shall at no time in the future be required to lay additional main beyond the original point of delivery to supply reclaimed water to said customer or others supplied through said customer's service. The original customer shall pay all charges for reclaimed water delivered through his service, at point of connection to the main, whether to his own premises or those of others which may be connected to such service. 
(Ord. 1995-50 § 1 (part), 1995).

    All persons taking any action or applying for any land development, land division or construction permits and/or approvals shall be required to submit for approval of an erosion and sediment control plan with their application and/or request, or; 
    Any person who undertakes, or is responsible for undertaking any action, which involves earth disturbance, is ultimately responsible to see that soil erosion and sedimentation as well as the resultant changed water flow characteristics are controlled to the extent necessary to avoid damage to property and to avoid pollution of receiving waters. Nothing in this chapter shall be taken or construed as lessening or modifying the ultimate responsibility of such persons. Nor do the requirements of this chapter imply the assumption of any liability therefore on the part of the city. 
    The standards, criteria and requirements of this chapter are to be seen as minimum standards that are not necessarily adequate to meet the highly variable conditions that must be covered by effective control measures. Compliance with the requirements of this chapter may not, therefore, of itself discharge such person's responsibility to provide effective control measures. 
    Erosion and sedimentation that occurs from construction activities within the city shall be prevented from leaving construction sites by providing proper provisions for water disposal and by protecting soil surfaces during and after construction, in order to promote the safety, public health, convenience and general welfare of the community. 
    No permits shall be issued unless said permits include soil erosion and sediment control measures consistent with the requirements of this chapter and related development standards. 
    This chapter shall be construed to assure consistency with the requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, applicable implementing regulation, and the NPDES municipal stormwater permit and any amendments, revisions or re-issuance thereof. No required permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall relieve a person of the responsibility to secure other permits and approvals required for activities regulated by any other applicable rule, code, act, permit or ordinance.

3.  All other land use zones or public areas of less than 10,000 square feet of new impervious surface, and/or less than 50 cubic yards of grading, and/or less than 1 acre of earth disturbance. 
4.  Where the city engineer agrees, in writing, with the permittee that the planned work and the final structures or topographical changes will not result in or contribute to soil erosion or sedimentation, i.e., the rainfall erosivity factor is less than 5 during the period of construction activity; will not interfere with any existing drainage course in such a manner as to cause damage to any adjacent property or result in the deposition of debris or sediment on any public way; will not present any hazard to any persons or property; or will have no detrimental influence upon the public welfare or upon the total development of the watershed. 
5.  Even though no erosion and sediment control plan is required under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, those operations and construction activities which are exempted from submitting an erosion and sediment control plan must comply with the rules and regulations in this chapter when conditions change such that appropriate controls are necessary to retain soil erosion on the area of earth disturbance.

1.  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
2.  Access to Facilities. 
(a)  The ECA shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to such agents. 
(b)  Facility operators shall allow the ECA ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(c)  The department shall have the right to enter any permitted facility and place any devices which are necessary, in the opinion of the ECA, to monitor or sample the facility's storm water discharge. 
(d)  The department has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary at his own expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be approved by the department and be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. Any costs associated with sample analysis from suspect discharges, that are found to be in non-compliance, shall be the responsibility of the discharger. 
(e)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the ECA and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(f)  Unreasonable delays (more than seven (7) days) in allowing ECA access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this ordinance. 
(g)  If the ECA has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction to enter the property to:

If the person fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the ECA may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
2.  Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The ECA will notify the person of the proposed termination of its MS4 access in accordance with the procedures detailed in the CCMC Section 12.06.155-Administrative action-Notice of violation. 
3.  A person commits a misdemeanor if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the ECA.

Chapter 13.06 - OPEN SPACE 
Sections: 

13.06.010 - Purpose. 
    In the broadest sense, the objective of the open space program is to promote quality of life for citizens of Carson City through the preservation and protection of the quality of the natural environment which has given Carson City much of its character. This natural environment includes many spectacular views of the mountains, Carson River, and Eagle Valley. The natural streams, wetlands and open lands, with their water and related plant and animal life complement the scenic vistas and remind us of the area's early history. These natural areas, water bodies, vistas and panoramas, natural landmarks, and native flora and fauna are intended to be preserved and protected for the enjoyment of this and future generations by the judicious use of funding for open space. 
    As Carson City continues to grow, open spaces should be provided and woven into the fabric of the city. These open spaces may define developed areas within the community, and in certain areas may define the boundary of the city. They are intended to obtain a balance and harmony between physical development and open space for the benefit of Carson City citizens. Preservation of open space in all parts of the city will foster appreciation of the natural environment, provide increased opportunities for passive recreation, preserve agricultural uses, allow connecting open space corridors, and improve the quality of life. 
    Carson City encourages residents of this community and other concerned persons or parties to donate certain lands or funds for use in the open space program. The board of supervisors may by resolution accept properties not acquired with open space funds into the open space program after a recommendation from the open space advisory committee. 
    The open space advisory committee shall provide the oversight over the administration and expenditure of funds from the open space division of the quality of life special revenue fund established by Carson City Municipal Code 21.07. The funding for open space including interest and other income, may be used for the acquisition, restoration of natural resources, development and construction which afford for public access, health and safety, equipping, improvement, maintenance, conservation planning and management of real property for open spaces acquired through the fund; and administrative costs approved by the committee. 
(Ord. 1997-30 § 1 (part), 2, 1997). 
13.06.020 - Creation of an open space advisory committee. 
    There is hereby created an open space advisory committee, hereinafter referred to as the committee, consisting of seven (7) members appointed by the board of supervisors. 
(Ord. 1997-30 § 1 (part), 3, 1997). 
13.06.030 - Committee membership. 
1.  The members of the committee shall be residents of Carson City, and qualified electors.

The committee shall also perform other duties as may be specifically assigned to it by the board of supervisors. 
2.  The committee in developing the open space element to the Carson City master plan, and in selecting open space lands for possible acquisition and preservation, shall be consistent with the intent of the 1996 ballot explanation, which was: The committee will work to sustain natural and scenic resources and the long-term quality of life in Carson City. And, acquisition of open space land will help preserve mountains, hills and scenic resources, conserve wildlife habitat, protect our drinking water sources and allow outdoor enjoyment of natural areas. Open space, which is defined as undeveloped land with valued natural resources, will be acquired from willing sellers, or by other mutually agreeable methods. 
3.  Open space will be acquired and maintained as conservancy areas to be used for the following purposes: 
a.  To provide off-street bicycle, hiking and equestrian trails, and trailhead facilities that connect parks, schools and the valley with the mountains. 
b.  To safeguard water resources: watershed areas, water-well sites and designated groundwater recharge areas. 
c.  To safeguard waterway corridors, floodplains, wetlands, streams and the Carson River. 
d.  To develop regional detention areas and protect floodplains. 
e.  To safeguard scenic vistas and enhance the gateways to our city.

(Ord. 1997-30 § 1 (part), 8, 1997). 
13.06.080 - Prohibited interest/confidentiality. 
    Any member appointed to the committee shall, upon the acceptance of such appointment, be deemed as having agreed to not disclose any data, the contents of any report or appraisal, or any information of whatsoever nature concerning any specific, prospective open space acquisition, to any person or entity except to other committee members, to members of the board of supervisors, to city staff members whose specific duties include the administration of the city's open space program, or as such disclosure may be required pursuant to court order. Any member who violates the conduct of confidentiality requirements shall be subject to being summarily suspended from the committee and such a violation may be deemed cause for removal.

    Generally, lands acquired with open space funds shall be preserved and managed in a near natural condition. Such lands might include scenic vistas, wetlands, streams, floodplains, trail corridors, agricultural lands, highly visible natural areas along major streets and open space buffers. Open space land will generally be open for passive recreation improvements developed where appropriate and environmentally compatible. Examples of compatible passive recreation include hiking, bicycling, equestrian trail uses, nature study, interpretive facilities, wildlife habitat, fishing and photography, or similar compatible uses. Development of traditional, active recreational facilities, such as athletic fields, swimming pools, and tennis courts are precluded. Shared participation in multi-use lands is possible. The open space element of the Carson City master plan, public hearing process and criteria developed by this committee shall provide direction for the acquisition of open space. 
(Ord. 1997-30 § 1 (part), 11, 1997). 
13.06.110 - Leasing open space lands. 
    Certain open space properties may be leased for continued open space agricultural uses such as farming or grazing. This approach can provide a link to Carson City's past, protect the land from development and can shift some maintenance costs to the leasee. Generally, the leased properties will continue to afford access for passive enjoyment, to the extent feasible. 
(Ord. 1997-30 § 1 (part), 12, 1997). 
13.06.120 - Disposal of open space lands and grants of exclusive licenses/permits. 
    In certain cases, it may be necessary to acquire a larger property in order to preserve a portion of the property as open space. In such cases, the city may dispose of the remainder. No open space lands may be sold, leased (does not include agricultural lease), traded, or otherwise conveyed, nor may any exclusive license or permit on such open space land be given until approval of such disposal or license or permit by the board of supervisors. The committee must hold a public hearing on a proposed disposal or license or permit. The city may not dispose of such lands or give any exclusive license or permit without a recommendation from the committee.

13.06.140 - Maintenance and management. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, open space land may not be improved after acquisition unless such improvements are necessary to protect or maintain the land or provide for passive recreation uses such as hiking, bicycling, equestrian and trailhead facilities, nature study, interpretative facilities, wildlife habitat, fishing and photography or similar compatible uses. It may be necessary to close an open space property temporarily, or seasonally, to protect a natural resource, or to make the property safe for public enjoyment. Maintenance and operation funds for open space acquired lands may be made available from the quality of life special revenue fund. The open space element of the Carson City master plan shall provide direction for the maintenance and management of open space lands pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. 1997-30 § 1 (part), 15, 1997).

    In order that the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of Carson City be furthered in an era of increased urbanization, growing demand for housing of all types and desire for attractive commercial and industrial developments, there is enacted an ordinance controlling planned unit developments. The purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter, in addition to the above, is to encourage more efficient use of the land and of public and private services in Carson City; to reflect the changes in technology of land development so the resulting economies benefit Carson City, and to preserve or provide open space, protect natural, cultural and scenic resources, minimize road building and encourage stable, cohesive neighborhoods offering a mix of housing types. 
    It is the intention of this chapter to produce developments which meet or exceed the city standards of open space, access to light and air, pedestrian and vehicular circulation and produce a variety of land uses which complement each other and harmonize with the existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity. Additionally, this chapter insures increased flexibility of substantive regulations over land development and that is administered in such a way as to encourage land development without undue delay, while controlling development in the best interests of the ecology, economy, public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Carson City.

"Planned unit development" means an area of land controlled by a landowner, which is to be developed as a single entity for a number of dwelling, commercial, and/or industrial units, the plan for which does not correspond in lot size, height, or size of dwelling, density, lot coverage, and required open space of the regulations established in any one use district created, from time to time, under the provisions of any zoning ordinance enacted pursuant to law. 
7.  "Zero lot line home" means a single-family detached residence with a zero or reduced setback on 1 or more property lines. 
(Ord. 2007-14§ 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.015 - Permitted uses. 
1.  Uses permitted in a residential planned unit development are limited to the following: 
a.  Any residential family dwelling unit, including mobilehomes provided they are used as a single-family residence and each unit is located on a separate lot or parcel of land and on a permanent foundation, and including a variety of housing types including, but not limited to, detached or attached single-family homes with a variety of lot configurations and setbacks, townhouses, cluster units, condominiums and zero lot line homes. 
b.  Parks, playgrounds, swimming pools and other recreational areas. 
c.  Non-residential buildings and structures if designed and used for the development as clubhouses, social halls, laundry, storage and utility facilities. 
d.  Recreational vehicle and boat storage accessory to a residential use. 
e.  Streets and parking areas. 
    None of the above shall be used or operated as a business, except as temporary tract sales offices and approved home occupations, but shall be used only in connection with the overall development of the planned unit development. 
2.  Uses authorized in commercial and industrial planned unit developments shall be limited to permitted uses within the underlying zoning district. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.020 - Timing of development. 
    The construction and development of all approved amenities, including open space and support facilities shall occur no later than the construction or development of 25 percent of the dwelling units. 
    Phased construction and development of approved amenities and support facilities may be authorized at the time of tentative approval. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.025 - Density of land. 
1.  The maximum residential density of a planned unit development shall be determined by the underlying zoning classification and shall be calculated by multiplying the gross area of the site by the following density formula: 
Applicable Zoning Classification Maximum Permitted PUD Density (Units Per Acre) SF6-MH6 8.0 SF12-MH12 4.0 SF21 2.3 SF1A-MH1A 1.1 SF2A 0.55 SF5A, CR, A 0.22 MFD 15.0 MFA 29.0 for two or more bedroom units 36.0 for studios or one bedroom units  
    If the above formula results in a fraction of 0.5 or above, it shall be rounded off to the next highest whole number. If the fraction is less than 0.5, it shall be rounded off to the next lowest whole number. 
    If the density of the proposed development exceeds the factor described above for the underlying zoning classification or if the placement of mobilehomes is contemplated in a zone other than a mobilehome zone, then a zoning map amendment is required as part of the planned unit development application. 
2.  The maximum lot density (amount of total gross square footage of the commercial or industrial use) of a commercial or industrial planned unit development can be increased up to 25 percent. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.030 - Expeditious processing. 
    In order to provide an expeditious method for processing a tentative planned unit development under the terms of this chapter and to avoid the delay of securing of approvals by a multiplicity of local procedures with regard to the division of land, zoning map amendment, and regulations otherwise applicable to the property, it is, therefore, declared to be in the public interest that all procedures with respect to the approval or disapproval of a planned unit development be applied for under a single application. 
    The processing of a planned unit development is completed in 3 stages. Stage 1 is the preliminary review of the conceptual plan. Stage 2 is the application for tentative approval of a planned unit development to the commission and approval by the board. Stage 3 is final approval of the planned unit development by the city. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.035 - Preliminary review of conceptual plan. 
    The initial step to be taken by the developer is to submit general conceptual plans to the planning division. The plan shall include: maps and drawings showing proposed land uses and land use on adjacent property, location of existing and proposed buildings and parking areas, proposed circulation, drainage water and sewer systems and existing topography. Also, an indication of residential densities, a schedule of development, and any additional information which may be required to determine if the proposed development conforms to the city master plan, the planned unit development ordinances and objectives. 
    Within 30 days after submission of the conceptual plan, the planning division staff shall meet with the applicant and review the proposal. The director shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the master plan and if it complies with all applicable codes.

Findings of fact shall not be inconsistent with the laws of the state or with a recommendation to the board within 30 days. The commission shall recommend disapproval or conditional approval on every tentative map if the map does not disclose full compliance with CCMC or NRS. 
4.  Recommendation of approval by the commission of tentative maps shall impose no obligation on the part of the board to approve the tentative map or to accept any public dedication shown thereon. 
5.  The board shall consider the commission's report and any new evidence as presented by the staff and the landowner. The board may continue a hearing to a specific time and may refer the matter back to staff or the commission for further study. In any event, however, the public hearings shall be concluded within 60 days after receipt of the commission report. 
6.  The board shall, after the conclusion of public hearings by minute action, grant tentative approval, tentative approval subject to specific conditions, or denial of a tentative plan. When tentative approval is granted, the board shall specify the maps, drawings, specifications, and form of performance bond that shall accompany the application for final approval.

17.09.065 - Options where plan is not in substantial compliance. 
1.  If the plan, as submitted for final approval, is not in substantial compliance with the plan as given tentative approval, the director shall, within 30 days of the date of the filing of the application for final approval, notify the landowner in writing, setting forth the particular ways in which the plan is not in substantial compliance. Thereupon, the landowner may: 
a.  Treat such notification as a denial of final approval; 
b.  Refile his plan in a form which is in substantial compliance with the plan as tentatively approved; or 
c.  File a written request with the department that the board hold a public hearing on his application for final approval. 
    If the landowner elects the alternatives set out in subsections b or c above, he must refile his plan or file a request for a public hearing on or before the last day of the time within which he was authorized to file for final approval, or 30 days from the date he receives notice that his plan is not in substantial compliance, whichever is later. Failure to refile a request or public hearing within such time period shall constitute an abandonment of the plan by the landowner. 
2.  The burden shall be upon the landowner to show the board good cause for any variation between the plan as tentative approved and the plan as submitted for final approval. 
3.  Any such public hearing shall be held by the board within 30 days after the request for the hearing is made by the landowner.

    Any time after a planned unit development is given final approval, the board may accept dedication of all or part of the common open space and other common property for public use and maintenance. Other common property can be streets, alleys, driveways, bike paths, sidewalks, or other such improvements. The dedication of common open space shall not be a condition of approval. 
    If dedication of any common open space or other common property is not accepted, the developer shall provide for and establish an organization for the ownership and maintenance for any and all common open space and other common property which shall include the following: 
1.  The form of document or covenant that will legally create an automatic membership, nonprofit homeowners or occupants association. 
2.  The style of ownership in the common open space and other common properties. 
3.  Restrictions on the use of such common open space and other common properties. 
4.  System for the operation and maintenance of the common open space and other common property. 
5.  The system of charges or assessments on each owner or occupant for the maintenance of the common open space and other common property, which will assure sufficient funds to operate and maintain the common open space and other common properties. 
6.  Residents or occupants of planned unit developments may, to the extent and in the manner expressly authorized by the provisions of their conditions, covenants, and restrictions, modify or remove their rights to enforce the provisions or their conditions, covenants, and restrictions, but no such action may affect the right of Carson City to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
7.  The documents and/or forms shall be reviewed by the district attorney and planning division prior to tentative approval. All documents required by Carson City shall be in a form that may be enforced by Carson City. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.110 - Failure of an organization to act. 
1.  Prior to establishing an organization that will provide for the ultimate ownership and maintenance of any common open space and other common property, the landowner shall be responsible for the proper operation and maintenance of such properties. Proper operation and maintenance shall constitute full compliance of the plans and schedules for such areas as approved by the board. The landowner shall remain responsible for the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the common open space and other common property until a minimum of 40 percent of the total units have been sold to individual buyers and the responsibility of the common areas has been transferred to the organization. 
2.  If an organization established by a landowner to provide for the ownership and maintenance of any common open space and other common property, at any time after the reestablishment of a planned unit development, fails to maintain the common open space and other common property in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the development plan, Carson City may serve written notice upon such organization or upon the residents of the planned unit development, setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space or other common property in reasonable condition. The notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 30 days of the receipt of such notice and shall state the date and place of a hearing before the board, which shall be within 14 days after the expiration of the 30 day's notice. At the hearing, the board may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.115 - Action by Carson City. 
    If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof are not cured within the 30 day period, or any extension thereof, the Carson City board of supervisors, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the planned unit development and to prevent a common open space and other common property from becoming a public nuisance, may direct city departments or their designee to enter the common open space or other common properties and maintain it for a period of 1 year or less. This, however, does not release the organization, residents, or occupants of planned unit developments from any liability which they would otherwise have. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001). 
17.09.120 - Maintenance for succeeding years. 
    Before the expiration of the period of maintenance as hereinabove set forth, the board shall upon its own initiative, call a show cause public hearing upon notice to such organization or to the residents of the planned unit development. At this hearing, the organization, residents, or occupants of a planned unit development shall show cause why such maintenance by the organization or residents of the planned unit development cannot be continued for the succeeding years. If the board determines that such organization is ready and able to maintain the common open space or other common property in a reasonable condition, Carson City shall cease its maintenance at the end of the year. If the board determines that such organization is not ready and able to maintain the common open space or other common properties in a reasonable condition, Carson City may, at its discretion, continue the maintenance of the common open space or other common property during the succeeding years. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-15 § 2 (part), 2001).

Chapter 17.17 - RESIDENTIAL CONDOMINIUMS 
Sections: 

17.17.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The board of supervisors recognizes that condominiums are a unique form of multi-family property ownership and have their own attendant advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, pursuant to NRS 116.1106, it is the express purpose and intent of the board of supervisors to address and provide for the uniqueness of condominiums. In order to provide for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community, the board of supervisors establishes this chapter to regulate condominium housing, as follows: 
1.  To ensure a reasonable balance of rental and ownership housing in Carson City and a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price and location of housing, particularly for low and moderate-income persons and families; 
2.  To reduce and ease the impact of displacement of long term residents, senior citizens, families with children, and those citizens who may be forced to move due to rental-to-condominium conversion; 
3.  To encourage the goal of owner-occupied housing; 
4.  To protect the financial investment of citizens who purchase condominiums, by requiring developers to disclose the necessary information upon which prospective condominium purchasers can base their decisions; 
5.  To protect the lives, health, safety and possessions of citizens who purchase condominiums.

(Ord. 2006-5 § 2 (part), 2006) 
17.17.070 - Pace of conversions. 
1.  This Section applies only to conversions. Multi-unit rental housing shall not be converted into condominiums if the vacancy rate for multi-unit rental housing is lower than three and one-quarter percent (3.25%) as determined pursuant to Subsection 3 of this Section per category described below. A conversion which causes the vacancy rate to fall below three and one-quarter percent (3.25%) in the appropriate category shall not be permitted. The vacancy rate for each category is to be figured separately. 
2.  Multi-unit rental housing may be converted into condominiums even if the vacancy rate for the category in which the project falls is less than three and one-quarter percent (3.25%), if seventy percent (70%) of the tenants residing in the rental housing project sign a statement approving of the conversion to condominiums. 
3.  The multi-unit rental housing vacancy rate shall be determined once yearly by the Planning Division by the 25th day of April. 
4.  For the purposes of this Section, two (2) categories of multi-unit rental housing are created. The categories are to be delimited in the following manner: 
a.  The division between the two (2) categories will be based on the dollar value of twenty-five percent (25%) of the median income (figured on a monthly basis) of a household in Carson City as established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
b.  Multi-unit rental housing units with average rents equal to or below this dollar value figure shall be in one (1) category and multi-unit rental housing units with average rents above this dollar value figure shall be in the second category. 
c.  To be eligible to convert in either category, the average rent of all the units must have been in one (1) category for one (1) year prior to date of application for conversion. A developer shall attach to the application for conversion substantiation of rents collected for the year prior to application in the form of accounting records, such as income tax returns or a statement by a certified public account licensed in the State of Nevada. 
5.  No special use permit application for a condominium conversion shall be accepted for hearing by the Carson City Planning Commission unless the vacancy rate, as determined by this Section, permits conversion; or unless the condominium conversion project falls within the exception of Subsection (2) of this Section. Once a special use permit application for a condominium conversion project has been approved, the approval shall not subsequently be rescinded due to a change in the vacancy rate following the approval. Approval of the special use permit by the Planning Commission, however, shall not obligate the Board of Supervisors to approve any parcel map or subdivision plat pertaining to the conversion project. 
(Ord. 2006-5 § 2 (part), 2006)

When, pursuant to NRS 40, a developer has terminated apartment tenancy en masse for any condominium conversion project, building or project phase, the developer is barred from applying for a special use permit for condominium conversion for that project, building or phase for a period of not less than 180 days from the termination period threshold described in Section 17.17.030(8). 
6.  Any tenant with more than 30 days remaining on a lease who receives a notice of an intent-to-sell shall, at any time after receipt of such notice, have the right to terminate such lease with 30 days written notice to the developer. Such termination shall be without penalty or other termination charge to the tenant. 
7.  A developer shall not increase the rents or fees payable by a tenant at any time during the 120-day period; except: 
a.  A developer may increase the rent of multi-unit rental housing when the rent of such housing includes utilities and the utility costs are increased by the utility provider, but the increase in rent shall be no greater than the proportionate increase in utility rates; and/or:

The developer shall not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. Except in cases of emergency, or unless it is impracticable to do so, the developer shall give the tenant at least 24 hours notice of his intent and may enter only at reasonable times. 
b.  A developer shall not undertake remodeling for conversion of a unit while it is occupied by a tenant without the consent of the tenant. A developer shall not create any disruption in the common areas inconsistent with good building practices, nor unreasonably restrict access, nor interfere with the quiet use and enjoyment of the premises at times other than normal week-day business hours. 
c.  An occupied unit of an apartment-to-condominium conversion project may be shown by a developer to actual or prospective workmen or purchasers during the last 30 days of the 120-day period or during the last 30 days of a period of tenancy.

For a period of 60 days from the date of mailing or delivery of the offer, the tenant shall have the exclusive right to purchase his or her unit or until the tenant vacates, whichever occurs first. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during that 60-day period, the developer may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following 180 days at a price or on terms more favorable to another prospective purchaser than offered to the affected tenant. 
2.  Upon acceptance by a prospective purchaser and the signing of the offer-of-sale, the earnest money shall be deposited by the developer immediately in an escrow account with a land title company licensed in the state of Nevada, to be released to the developer only upon close of escrow.

18.02.065 - Administrative abandonment of public utility, easements. 
    For the purposes of this section a "public utility easement" is an easement obtained by Carson City or a public utility which is owned or controlled by Carson City and which runs in favor of the city. Pursuant to NRS 278.480(10) and through the use of the procedure contained in this section, a public utility easement may be abandoned without a hearing of the board or the commission. The owner of property who seeks abandonment of a public utility easement involving his or her property shall file an application in writing with the planning and community development department on the forms required by that department. The application shall also include a legal description and exhibit prepared and signed by a surveyor licensed in the state of Nevada unless the city engineer waives the requirements of retaining a state licensed surveyor for the preparation of the documents. The director of the planning and community development department, or his or her designee, may issue a written order abandoning a public utility easement after: 
1.  Receiving a complete application; 
2.  Obtaining the written approval of the city engineer or his or her designee, and the utilities director or his or her designee; and 
3.  Determining the subject public utility easement is no longer necessary or useful to Carson City. The abandonment of a public utility easement pursuant to this section does not affect an easement held by a private utility company even if such private utility easement was created by the same instrument or it has the same legal description, and also does not affect an easement held by the public as distinguished from an easement held by Carson City or a public utility owned or controlled by Carson City. A decision of the director made under this section may be appealed in the manner provided for in Title 18 (Administrative Procedures). 
(Ord. 2001-23 § 2 (part), 2001).

2.  Adoption of Master Plan. The commission shall prepare and adopt a comprehensive, long term master plan for the physical development of Carson City. This plan shall be known as the city's master plan and must be so prepared that all or portions thereof may be adopted by the board as the basis for the development of the city for a set, reasonable period of time pursuant to NRS 278.150. 
3.  Elements of the City's Master Plan. The master plan, along with accompanying charts, drawings, diagrams, schedules and reports, may include, but is not limited to, the subject matter as are appropriate for the city and as may be the basis for the physical development thereof as stated under NRS 278.160, as amended from time to time by the Nevada Legislature. 
    The commission may prepare and adopt all or a portion thereof of the master plan for all or any part of the city pursuant to NRS 278.170. 
    The commission shall, during the formation of plans for community design and public buildings, notify the school district's governing body to consider the preparation of such plans and to adequately and properly locate school sites. 
4.  Interest in Master Plan. The commission shall endeavor to promote public interest in and understanding of the city's master plan and regulations relating thereto. As a means of furthering the purpose of the master plan, the commission shall make annual recommendations to the board for the implementation of the master plan. It also shall consult and advise with public officials, agencies and citizens to implement such plans. 
    Pursuant to NRS 278.190, subsection 3, the commission members and employees, in the performance of their functions, may enter upon any land and make examinations and surveys. Furthermore, pursuant to subsection 4, the commission shall have power as may be necessary to enable it to fulfill its function and carry out the provisions of this title and NRS 278.010 to 278.630, inclusive.

5.  Implementation of City's Master Plan by the board. Whenever the board has approved the commission's adopted master plan or a part thereof, the board shall, upon recommendation of the commission, determine a reasonable and practical means for implementing the master plan or a portion thereof. The master plan will serve as a pattern and guide for that kind of orderly physical growth and development of Carson City which will cause the least amount of natural resource impairment and will conform to the adopted population/growth management plan, as a basis for the efficient expenditure of funds thereof, relating to the subject elements of the master plan. After recommendation from the commission, the board may adopt and use procedures as may be necessary for the implementation of this title. 
6.  Requirements for Application. 
a.  Initiation of Amendments. A master plan amendment may be initiated by the board of commission through resolution. An owner of real property may initiate an amendment for their property through an application filed with the director. A master plan amendment may also be initiated by the property owner if the property owner has entered into escrow with a buyer for purchase of the property with an expiration date of less than the period of time remaining before the next regular master plan review period. 
b.  Master Plan Elements may be initiated by the Board of Supervisors or Planning Commission. 
c.  Types of Applications. There are 3 types of applications for master plan amendments. The first type is an amendment to the land use map of the land use element. The second type of amendment is to revise the text in the various master plan elements. Applications for revisions to the text within master plan elements by the commission and board can be submitted at any time in the year. The third type of amendments to the city's master plan is adoption of a new master plan element. 
d.  Timing of Amendments. The city's master plan land use map may be amended by the board no more than 4 times per year. Applications or resolutions for master plan amendments shall only be accepted during the planning commission submittal dates in January, April, July, and October for review by the planning commission at its regular meeting the following month. Master plan elements or other master plan text amendments may be submitted in any month during the calendar year for adoption. 
e.  Frequency of Amendment. Only the board or commission may initiate an amendment of the master plan for a parcel within 12 months after an amendment on that parcel has been approved or denied. 
f.  Completeness. No master plan amendment or element shall be processed until the information necessary to review and decide upon the proposed master plan amendment or element is deemed complete by the director. 
7.  Review Procedures. The commission shall review a master plan amendment or element in conformance with this section. 
a.  General Provisions. The commission shall conduct at least 1 public hearing with notification for the purpose of receiving oral and written evidence relative to the application. The evidence shall be reviewed to determine if the proposed amendment or element is consistent with existing goals, objectives, policies and action programs of the master plan. The commission shall approve, modify, or deny the application based on the results of this review. 
b.  Specific Plan. A specific plan may be submitted as part of a master plan amendment. A specific plan will allow for more precise implementation of the master plan by requiring or permitting review of large scale planning issues in order to protect the natural environment, ensure compatible uses, conserve energy, achieve coherent and diverse development patterns, and ensure that roads and other infrastructure are or will be adequate to serve new development. As a minimum, all specific plans shall include: 
(1)  The distribution, location and extent, density and general intensity of land uses, including open space (including a land use plan map and associated text); 
(2)  The distribution, location and extent of major infrastructure systems to address transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste and other essential services; 
(3)  A plan for phasing the development of land uses and infrastructure; 
(4)  A financing plan for proposed infrastructure;

(7)  Performance standards to achieve the goals and objectives of the master plan; 
(8)  Where adjacent land uses are not compatible (according to the adopted master plan showing friction areas), appropriate performance standards for transition zones for buffering, screening and open space to protect adjacent uses; 
(9)  Other requirements including development agreements as deemed appropriate by the director. The specific plan designation shall apply to areas with 10 acre minimum combined land area as designated on the master plan land use map. The specific plan designation shall not be used as the basis for development proposals unless and until a specific plan for the area is approved and adopted by the board. All discretionary permit applications submitted must be consistent with the applicable specific plan provisions, however, should a property owner in the specific plan designation desire to develop, prior to adoption of a specific plan, then an amendment to change the land use designation from specific plan to another land use will be required before the development proposal is approved by Carson City. However, should an area not be designated on the master plan land use map as a specific plan, it may be requested for specific plan designation accompanying a master plan amendment application. In such case the specific plan designation will be determined by the commission with recommendation by the director. 
(10)  All other code standards as required by Title 18 are applicable to the specific plan process. 
c.  Concurrent Processing of Applications. If a proposed project requires more than 1 application under the provisions of this title, the applications may be filed at the same time and processed concurrently.

8.  Notice for Master Plan Amendments or Elements. Notice for all master plan amendments or elements shall be given in accordance with the provisions of this section and NRS 278.210. If a master plan element contains specific development plans, then notice in addition to this section as well as NRS 278.210 shall be accomplished, and furthermore, noticing of the specific development site shall be in accordance with the provisions of NRS 278.315(3) and CCMC 18.02.045 (Notice of Commission Hearings). 
a.  Amendment Not Affecting Boundaries. A proposed master plan amendment that does not change the boundaries of the land use categories of the land use plan map, e.g. text change, shall not require property owner noticing as set forth in Title 18 (Notice). 
9.  Commission Action. The commission may take action to adopt or deny the master plan amendment or element request. An action to adopt the master plan amendment or element shall be by resolution of the commission carried by the affirmative votes of not less than 2/3 of the total membership. The resolution shall refer expressly to the maps, descriptive matter, text or other matter intended by the commission to constitute the amendment or element. Failure of the commission to hold a public hearing or take action within the time frames provided in this article shall constitute a recommendation of approval of the master plan amendment or element application.

Standard Conditions of Approval are found in section 18.02.105. 
8.  Expiration; Revocation. 
a.  Where a use permitted by an approved Special Use Permit is not made on the property within twelve (12) months from the date of approval, unless additional time is granted by the Commission based upon consideration of the specific circumstances of the project, then without further action, the Special Use Permit shall be null and void and such use shall not be made of the property except upon the granting of a new Special Use Permit.

The written request for an extension shall be received by the Planning Division thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date and shall state the reason for the extension. The Director may approve a one-year extension from the original date of Special Use Permit expiration with the option of Commission review. The Commission may approve additional extensions of time subject to the consideration of the continued appropriateness of the Special Use Permit and may be subject to the imposition of additional conditions by the Commission to ensure that the activity permitted by the Special Use Permit does not adversely impact other properties in the area or the public interest. 
d.  A Special Use Permit shall be, upon violation, subject to revocation or amendment by the Commission.

The director will notify the applicant of any investigation prior to any public hearing. 
b.  After an investigation, if the commission determines that a ground for revocation or reexamination of a variance or special use permit exists, then the commission shall direct staff to issue and serve the applicant with an order to show cause why the variance or special use permit should not be revoked or reexamined.

18.02.100 - Major project review (MPR). 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of the MPR process is to provide a preliminary review of development plans for projects to reduce the need for an applicant to contact individual city departments and other agencies to obtain information relevant to the approval of a project. This review allows an applicant to ascertain what may be required to gain approval for a project during the city's permitting review process. The MPR process is utilized to solicit many of the requirements and recommendations of the various city departments in a coordinated and comprehensive fashion. 
2.  Applicability. A MPR is required for all mobilehome parks, RV parks, campgrounds and multi-family projects, as well as commercial, office and industrial projects and institutional or public uses with building area greater than 50,000 square feet, and for increases in floor area or number of units/spaces for such uses of 10 percent or more. 
    Applicants for smaller projects may make application for MPR on a voluntary basis. 
3.  Process. 
a.  The director, upon submission of a MPR application and required submittal information, will circulate the application to city departments and agencies for review. A MPR meeting will be scheduled by staff within 30 days of submittal. At the meeting, city staff from various city departments will identify design concerns, offer alternative design considerations, identify code deficiencies and other issues as can be determined from the application materials. Applicants are encouraged to ask staff questions relevant to the project. 
b.  A letter is sent to the applicant upon conclusion of the meeting outlining the recommendation and concerns relative to the MPR meeting. The applicant is then able to address the concerns noted at the MPR and may then submit plans for formal project applications and permits. 
(Ord. 2007-9 § 2, 2007: Ord. 2001-23 § 2 (part), 2001).

18.02.110 - Administrative permits. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of administrative permits is to provide for the method of reviewing proposed uses which possess characteristics that have the potential to adversely affect other land uses, transportation or facilities in the vicinity. The hearing examiner may require conditions of approval necessary to eliminate or reduce any adverse effects of a use. 
2.  Applicability. This chapter establishes a process that authorizes the hearing examiner to review and render final decisions on zoning matters and development proposals identified within this chapter as requiring an administrative permit pursuant to the provisions of CCMC 18.02.052 (Hearing Examiners). 
3.  Permit Required. An administrative permit shall be required in the following cases:

No administrative permit shall be processed until the information necessary to review and decide the proposed administrative permit is deemed complete by the director. Noticing requirements shall be consistent with Title 18 (Notice of Commission Hearings). 
    This title delegates certain authority for making decisions relating to various development applications, uses and similar approvals to the hearing examiner.

18.02.115 - Temporary use permits. 
1.  Purpose. This Section provides for the temporary permitted uses of short term commercial activities that may not meet the normal development or use standards of the applicable zoning district, but may otherwise be acceptable because of their temporary nature. 
a.  Carson City has an economy that is partly dependent on tourism and retail sales, and is therefore, partly dependent on its appearance. Outside sales, display preparation service and storage can adversely affect the appearance and public image of Carson City. It is within the public interest and contributes to the general welfare to project an attractive community image and to promote retail sales. 
b.  Outside sales, activities and uses are generally prohibited by the provisions of the Carson City Municipal Code, Title 18, zoning districts. Except as specifically provided otherwise by the Carson City Municipal Code, all outside sales, storage and displays shall be conducted entirely in accordance with these provisions. 
2.  Applicability. This Chapter establishes a process for the Director's review of a proposed temporary use to ensure basic health, safety and community welfare standards are met, and only suitable temporary uses with the minimum necessary conditions or limitations consistent with the temporary nature of the use are approved. 
3.  Process. Applications for any permits to establish temporary uses, as described in this Chapter, must be filed with the Planning and Community Development Department in a manner prescribed by the Director, along with the required fee. A fee sheet can be obtained at the Planning and Community Development Department.

4.  Procedures for the Review and Approval of a Mobilehome Park. 
a.  A pre-application conference with the director in order to explain city ordinances and regulations, is required prior to the submission of a mobilehome park development plan for the review by Carson City. The purpose of the pre-application conference is to familiarize the applicant with the provisions of the mobilehome park ordinance and requirements.

Each application for a major project review shall be submitted to the director and include the required information and fees. 
c.  After the pre-application conference and major project review process has been completed for a park proposing 10 or more units, or a pre-application conference has been completed for a park proposing less than 10 units, an applicant may then proceed to apply for a building permit, within 180 days of the project review meeting. 
d.  The building and safety department is responsible for processing the plans for the review by city departments and collecting the fees for reviews as required by the code. No permit for construction shall be issued unless approval has first been received from the planning and community development, and other pertinent departments.

6.  Nonconforming Uses. 
a.  Within Carson City there exist mobilehome parks which are considered lawful before the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but may be prohibited or nonconforming under this chapter.

Title 18 Appendix - CARSON CITY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
Divisions: 
Division 1 - LAND USE AND SITE DESIGN 
Sections: 

1.0 - General. 
    These design standards have been prepared to foster quality design of office, commercial, multi-family, public, industrial and institutional projects within Carson City. The image of the community affects the economic well being of the city, especially the tourism economy. These standards are aimed at improving the community image. 
    These standards are intended to inspire development of lasting quality and designs that enhance the overall community. They are intended to assist the public, developers and design professionals in planning and designing projects. These standards shall also serve as criteria for design review by city staff, the planning commission (commission), and board of supervisors (board). 
1.1 - Architectural design. 
    Office, retail, commercial, public, institutional, industrial and multi-family buildings and their architecture play a large role in establishing the overall image of the community. In all cases, these standards stress the importance of visually identifying and unifying the community character. These standards do not require a single architectural style; instead an eclectic mixture of harmonious styles are encouraged. Buildings which are 50 years or older within the downtown area must meet the requirements of the downtown business district found in the Carson City Municipal Code. 
1.1.1  The architectural style, massing and proportion of a building should be compatible with and compliment its surroundings and environmental characteristics of the community. 
1.1.2  Buildings should be designed on a "human scale" by using architectural enhancements such as windows, awnings, arcades, plazas, courtyards and roof overhangs. 


Architectural enhancements such as roof overhangs, arcades and trellises shall be used. 
1.1.3  Variations of building details, form, line, color and materials shall be employed to create visual interest. Variations in wall planes, roof lines and direction are encouraged to prevent monotonous appearance in buildings. Large expanses of walls devoid of any articulation or embellishment shall be avoided. Similarly vertical variation in the roof line is encouraged. Mansard roofs shall wrap around the entire building. 

Variation in wall planes adds interest 

Typical materials and finishes

( Ord. No. 2008-33, § XIII, 9-4-2008 ) 
1.3 - Lighting standards. 
    This section sets forth criteria and standards to mitigate impacts caused by lighting and glare. 
    Lighting Purpose Statement. Office, retail, commercial, public, institutional, industrial and multi-family buildings and their lighting are part of the overall image of the community. In all cases, these standards stress the importance of visually identifying and unifying the community character. Unnecessary and improperly designed light fixtures cause glare, or intense light that results in unnecessary brightness, a reduction of visual performance and visibility, light pollution and wasted resources through additional expense for utility costs, hazardous conditions for all modes of transportation, and also affects the ability to view the night sky, including astronomical observations. The following regulations are intended to mitigate these conditions by regulations that require shielding, pointing lighting downward (other than accent lighting), only using the amount of light that is necessary and recommending turning fixtures down or off when not required. All new lighting including upward wall lighting must be reviewed and approved by the director or his designee. 
    Applicability: 
1.3.1  All existing structures and residential uses are exempt from this ordinance and are considered grand fathered improvements. All proposed new commercial developments, buildings, multi family residential complexes of 10 units or more, structures or building additions of 50 percent or more in terms of additional dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein, either with a single addition or cumulative additions subsequent to the effective date of this provision, shall meet the requirements of this Ordinance for the entirety of the property, including all existing and proposed lighting unless exempted under Nonconforming Uses, shown below. For all building additions of less than a cumulative amount of 50 percent, the applicant shall only have to meet the requirements of this section for only the new outdoor lighting proposed. 
1.3.2  Nonconforming Uses or Structures. Whenever a nonconforming use, structure or building is abandoned for a period of 12 months and then changed to a new use according to the requirements of this code as described in Municipal Code Title 18.04.030 Nonconforming Uses, then any existing outdoor lighting, with the exception of conversion to a residential use of nine units or less, shall be reviewed and brought into compliance with this code. 
1.3.3  General Requirements in All Commercial and Industrial Zones: 
    Light. All nonresidential uses shall provide lighting within public parking areas and access ways to provide safety and security. All light sources shall be located and installed in such a way as to prevent spillover lighting onto adjoining properties and glare to the sky. The following provisions shall apply to all proposed development: 
1.  Any lighting facilities shall be so installed as to project light downward and away from adjoining properties and glare to the sky, with the exception of accent lighting, which is limited to a maximum upward angle of forty-five (45) degrees. Site lighting trespass onto adjacent locations and the night sky shall be minimized. Covers must be installed on all lighting fixtures and lamps must not extend below the bottom of the cover. All light fixtures, except street lights, shall be located, aimed or shielded so as to minimize stray light trespassing beyond property boundaries. 
2.  All light fixtures that are required to be shielded shall be installed in such a manner that the shielding is installed as designed. Fixtures, which are International Dark Sky Association approved such as Dark Sky Friendly or equivalent, with full cutoff lighting for area and wall pack fixtures are recommended. Sag, convex, drop lenses and luminaries with open bulbs are prohibited. 
3.  If elevations of buildings are proposed for accent illumination, drawings and a photometric plan shall be provided for all relevant building elevations showing the fixtures, the portions of the elevations to be illuminated, the illuminance levels of the elevations and the aiming points. The maximum upward angle is forty-five (45) degrees. 
4.  Light standards, light poles and wall pack lighting adjacent to residential zones shall be limited in height as follows: Fixtures shall not exceed an overall height of twelve (12) feet within seventy-five (75) feet, sixteen (16) feet within one hundred (100) feet, twenty (20) feet within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, twenty-four (24) feet within one hundred fifty (150) feet and twenty-eight (28) feet within one hundred seventy-five (175) feet of property line, or center of street, whichever is closer, when adjacent to residential zones. Additional height may be permitted by the Director provided such lights are a sharp cutoff lighting system. Illumination levels at the property line of a project shall be reduced by the use of house side shields and reflectors, and shall be maintained in such a manner as to confine light rays to the premises of the project. 
5.  No permanent rotating searchlights shall be permitted in any regulatory zone, except that an Administrative Permit may be issued by the Director for a period not to exceed three (3) days for a temporary searchlight. The Administrative Permit shall be limited to a minimum of three (3) times in one (1) calendar year. This prohibition shall not apply to the Carson City Airport. 
6.  Parking area lights are encouraged to be greater in number, lower in height and lower in light level, as opposed to fewer in number, higher in height and higher in light level. A photometric plan is required on all projects with building size of fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or larger and may also be required at the discretion of the Director. 
7.  For all projects where the total initial output of the proposed lighting equals or exceed one hundred thousand (100,000) lumen, certification that the lighting, as installed, conforms to the approved plans shall be provided by a certified engineer before the certificate of occupancy is issued. Until this certification is submitted and reviewed, approval for use of a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for the project. 
8.  Exterior lighting installations shall include timers, dimmers, sensors or photocell controllers that turn the lights off during daylight hours or when lighting is not needed, which will reduce unnecessary lighting, as practical. Businesses are encouraged to turn lighting down or off when businesses are not open. 
9.  Glare. Reflected glare on nearby buildings, streets or pedestrian areas shall be avoided by incorporating overhangs and awnings, using building materials and colors which are less reflective for exterior walls and roof surfaces, controlling angles of reflection and placing landscaping and screening in appropriate locations. 
1.3.4  Interior lighting. Where residential uses abut non-residential uses, interior building lighting of the non-residential uses shall be controlled at night through the use of timers, window blinds or other acceptable means. 
1.3.5  General Lighting Performance Standards. All exterior light fixtures shall use full cut-off luminaries with the light source downcast and fully shielded with no light emitted above the horizontal plane. Again, fixtures which are International Dark Sky Association approved such as Dark Sky Friendly or equivalent with full cutoff lighting for area and wall pack fixtures are recommended. Exceptions are noted below. 
1.  Luminaries which have a maximum output of 500 lumen per fixture, (equivalent to one 40-watt incandescent bulb) regardless of number of bulbs, may be left unshielded provided the fixture has an opaque top to keep light from shining directly up. Luminaries which have a maximum output of 850 lumen per fixture, (equal to one 60 watt incandescent light) regardless of number of bulbs, may be partially shielded, provided the bulb is not visible from off-site, no direct glare is produced, and the fixture has an opaque top to keep light from shining directly up. 
2.  Accent Lighting. Architectural features may be illuminated by up-lighting or light directed to the building, such as wall washing, provided that the light is effectively aimed to or contained by the structure by such methods as caps, decks, canopies, marquees, signs, etc, the lamps are low intensity to produce a subtle lighting effect, and no light trespass is produced. The angle of up-lighting shall not exceed 45 degrees. Luminaries shall not be installed above the height of the parapet or roof. For national flags, statutes, public art, historic buildings or other objects of interest that cannot be illuminated with down-lighting, upward lighting may be used in the form of narrow-cone spotlighting that confines the illumination to the object of interest. 
3.  All luminaries shall be aimed and adjusted to provide illumination levels and distribution as indicated on submitted plans. All fixtures and lighting systems shall be in good working order, cleaned and maintained in a manner that serves the original design intent of the system. 
4.  Floodlights that are not full cut-off (light emitted above the fixture) may be used if permanently directed downward, not upward, and aimed at no more than a 45 degree angle, so no light is projected above the horizontal plane, and fitted with external shielding for top and side to prevent glare and off-site light trespass. Unshielded floodlights are prohibited. 
5.  Sensor activated lighting may be used provided it is located in such a manner as to prevent direct glare and lighting into properties of others or into a public right-of-way, and provided the light is set to go on only when activated and to go off within five minutes after activation has ceased, and the light shall not be triggered by activity off the property. 
6.  Vehicular lights and all temporary emergency lighting such as search lights or any similar high-intensity lights as needed by the fire department, sheriff's office, public works department, Carson City Airport, utility companies, State or Federal Departments or other emergency services shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance. 
7.  Illumination for outdoor recreation facilities must conform to the shielding requirements, except when such shielding would interfere with the intended activity. For such facilities, partially-shielded luminaries are permitted. Examples f activities where partially-shielded luminaries are permitted include, but are not limited to, baseball, softball and football. Fully-shielded luminaries are required for tennis, volleyball, racquetball, handball courts and swimming pools. Rotating airport beacons are exempt from this requirement. 
8.  Service Station/Canopy Lighting. All luminaries mounted on the under surface of service station canopies shall be fully shielded and utilize flat covers. All lighting shall be recessed sufficiently so as to ensure that no light source causes glare on public rights-of-way or adjacent property. A maximum of 850 lumen per fixture is allowed (equivalent to one 60-watt incandescent bulb). 
9.  Temporary Lighting. The director may grant a permit for temporary lighting, which does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance if the applicant meets the following criteria: the purpose for which the lighting is proposed does not extend beyond 60 days, but may be granted a 30 day extension after review by the Director. The director will rule on the application within 5 business days of the date of submission of the request, and notify the applicant in writing of the decision. 
a.  The proposed lighting must be designed in such a manner as to minimize light trespass and glare to the sky. 
b.  It will be a temporary use and will be in the public interest. 
c.  The application for temporary lighting shall include the following information: 
    The name and address of the applicant and property owner, a site plan showing entire site and location of proposed luminaries, manufacturers specification sheets showing type, wattage and height of lamp(s) with type and shielding of proposed luminaries, or if not new, pictures of previous sites or of the fixtures proposed to be used. 
10.  Maintenance. All fixtures shall be maintained in good working order, with aiming, angles, wattage and intensity as originally approved. Replacement bulbs shall be the same or less wattage and intensity as originally approved. Fixtures and reflecting surfaces shall be cleaned on a regular schedule to reduce additional unapproved glare. 
11.  The director may approve variations to the standards set out in this Division if variations are more appropriate to a particular site, provide an equivalent means of achieving the intent of these lighting standards and are in keeping with the purpose statement of this section. A letter of request detailing the reason for the variation and changes requested is required to be submitted to the director. 
12.  These standards are enforced under Title 18.020.030 (Enforcement).

(Ord. 2007-26 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-23). 
3.4 - Preservation and protection of existing trees and shrubs. 
    Trees and significant shrubs shall be preserved whenever possible and shall be considered part of the required landscape area. Preservation of existing 4-inch caliper (6-8 foot for evergreens) healthy trees will be eligible for a 2:1 credit toward the total tree requirement if approved by the director, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the requirement for trees on the site. Provide an overlay on all submitted plans of all existing trees with caliper (deciduous) or height (evergreen) and significant shrubs on the site and clearly mark which will be retained on the site and which are proposed to be removed. 
3.4.1  Deciduous trees with a trunk diameter of 4 inch or greater at a point four and 1/2 foot above ground level or evergreen trees 6 foot or greater in height or significant shrubs, shall not be removed unless authorized by prior written approval from the director. The applicant is encouraged to submit a report to the director prepared by a certified arborist, or licensed design professional detailing a reason for a request to authorize removal of trees and significant shrubs. After consultation with other applicable city divisions, the director may authorize the removal of existing trees and shrubs if any of the following criteria exist: 
1.  The health or condition of the tree presents a clear danger to people or property or it constitutes a nuisance. 
2.  When the tree or shrub is located within the footprint of the building, or when a tree trunk or shrub is so close to the building area that construction would result in irreparable damage or death to the plant. 
3.  Access is so restricted to the site that removal is necessary and unavoidable. 
4.  The elevation will be severely changed by grading/building/development. The tree or shrub cannot remain on the site as a result of the change in elevation. 
5.  Any other instances deemed appropriate by the director shall be considered. 
3.4.1.1  All trees removed from a site, which were not previously approved under the criteria outlined in subsection 3.4.1 above, require replacement by 1 of the methods listed below. As an example, removal of a 6-inch diameter tree would require replacement of the tree with 4, 3-inch caliper trees or the equivalent. 
a.  Deciduous trees require replacement with a 2:1 caliper ratio tree, with a minimum caliper of 2 inch and a maximum of 3 inch per tree. 
b.  Evergreen trees require replacement with a 2:1 height ratio, with a height minimum of 6 foot and maximum of 8 foot per replacement tree. 
c.  Tree replacement may require off-site mitigation, including planting of trees on public property. Off-site mitigation shall require approval by the parks and recreation director. Payment of fees to purchase and plant trees, as well as associated costs are required, rather than actual planting of trees on public property. Appropriate fees which are based on the placement of trees in the right-of-way program as periodically updated shall be paid to the parks and recreation department. Provide the planning department with a copy of receipt for payment of required tree replacement/mitigation fees. Payment is required prior to the building permit being issued. 
3.4.2  Tree Protection. All deviations from the tree protection code must be approved by the planning division. Construction activities can severely damage or kill trees. See tree retention/protection, root pruning detail, and excavation adjacent to retained trees in appendix for additional requirements and information. The following practices must be followed during all construction activities: 
1.  Pruning of live branches from trees identified for preservation is prohibited except in conjunction with subsection 3.4.3 Pruning Standards. See pruning details in appendix for more requirements and details. 
2.  Tree protection fencing and protection is required around all trees identified for preservation. See detail in appendix. Construct protection fencing which complies with the following: 
a.  Protective fencing must be constructed of 4 foot wide minimum orange netting or chain link. Fencing must be a minimum of 5 feet outside the tree drip line. Fences must be mounted on above ground concrete footings, which shall not be driven into the ground. Spacing shall be no more than 10 foot. This detail shall be placed on all grading, demolition and improvement plans. 
b.  Protective fencing shall enclose the entire area under the canopy drip line of the tree protection zone throughout the life of the project, or until work within the tree protection zone is completed. The fence shall not be moved during construction phase without prior approval of the qualified site professional utilizing the best management practices. The protective fence may be removed at final grading inspection or at the time final landscaping is installed. Refer to detail in appendix for sample drawing. 
c.  A sign describing the fence as protective tree fencing shall be prominently displayed on each fence. The sign must be a minimum of 8.5 by 11 inches and clearly state: "Tree Protection Zone. This fence shall not be removed and is subject to penalty per Carson City Municipal Code." Refer to detail in appendix for sample drawing. 
3.  If protective fencing cannot be placed around the entire tree protection zone, then protective fencing shall be placed around the trunk of the tree(s) but only after prior approval of the proposal by the planning division. 2 by 4 lumber shall be secured with banding around the trunk of tree(s) to be preserved. Do not attach boards or banding directly into the bark or trunk of the tree. 
4.  There should be no activity in the tree protection zone without prior approval by the planning division. The following are prohibited activities within the tree protection zone: 
a.  Soil disturbance, including excavation, trenching or grade change without prior approval of the planning division. 
b.  Spoils, non-spoils, storage of any equipment, materials or parking. 
c.  Placement of non-spoil material or equipment. 
5.  Apply 6 inches of wood chips or bark over the root zone of trees within the protective barriers. Mulching areas outside of protective barriers will help to minimize compaction from construction traffic adjacent to sensitive root zones. 
6.  Hand digging shall be required to determine if lateral roots are present on trees in the direction of proposed foundation location. If support roots are found, it is recommended that correct root pruning is performed, so as to not compromise the stability of the tree(s). 
7.  Correctly and cleanly prune exposed roots that are not to be saved back to the soil horizon in compliance with detail in subsection 3.4.3. Pruning should be supervised by a qualified licensed professional and should be performed to ISA standards (see details in appendix). 
8.  Promptly cover exposed roots with damp tarp(s) which are kept moist, or material that will keep roots from drying. 
9.  Irrigate within the dripline of trees once a week if natural precipitation does not occur during spring, summer and fall. 
10.  See detail for tree retention, root pruning and excavation adjacent to retained trees in appendix. 
3.4.3  Pruning Standards. No trees on commercial or industrial land which is part of required landscaping shall be pruned in a manner that impairs the health of the tree. All pruning performed on required trees shall be in accordance with pruning standards published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), per ANSI A300 Part 1 Pruning, and International Society of Arboriculture, Western Chapter. See appendix regarding pruning detail. 
1.  ANSI pruning standards require in part, the use of certain tools, cutting techniques, and pruning methods to be followed, including not leaving branch stubs, few or no heading cuts, not cutting off the branch collar (not making a cut flush with the trunk), not topping or lion's tailing ("gutting-out" a tree by removing a large number of the inner branches), not removing more than 25 percent of the foliage of a single branch, not removing more than 25 percent of the total tree foliage in a single year, not damaging other parts of the tree during pruning and not using wound paint. 50 percent of the foliage should remain evenly distributed in the lower 66 percent of the tree canopy after pruning. 
2.  All pruned material shall be controlled and removed in a manner to prevent damage to the surrounding plant material and property. Tree topping, tipping and heading back are all terms used to describe severe cutting back of a tree's crown and is prohibited on any tree which is part of required landscaping and strenuously discouraged on any other trees on the site. 
3.  Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or trees under utility wire or other obstructions, where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempted from the prohibition of topping, tipping and heading back, at the discretion of the director. A letter of request must be submitted to the director and approved prior to such severe pruning. 
(Ord. 2007-26 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-23). 
3.5 - Landscape design standards. 
3.5.1  All landscaping shall aesthetically enhance and be compatible with the site area. Landscaping shall be installed to enhance the view of the site from public street(s) and adjacent properties. 
3.5.2  A minimum of 20 percent of the site's impervious surfaces excluding the building coverage must be pervious areas of landscape material. The area within the public right-of-way adjacent to a site must be landscaped and may be counted for 25 percent of the total required landscaped area. In areas with right-of-ways over 20 feet in depth, the director may modify or waive the requirement for landscaping of the right-of-way. The requirement may also be waived by the director if the public agency denies permission for an encroachment permit or lease of the area to be landscaped. 
(Ord. 2007-26 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-23). 
3.6 - Turf. 
    The following standards for the use of turf in landscaping are intended to conserve water by minimizing the need for water for irrigation and minimizing irrigation water wasting. 
3.6.1  Turf areas shall not constitute more than the percentage of the total landscape area as established by the table below unless approved by special use permit.

3.6.2  Turf shall not be used on slopes greater than 4:1 or in areas less than 8 feet in width or length. 
3.6.3  Where landscape areas abut sidewalks, drive-aisles, parking areas or other hardscape surfaces, a minimum 3-foot wide landscape buffer area must be provided between any turf areas and the hardscape to capture irrigation overspray and runoff. The buffer area may be drip-irrigated plant materials or non-living landscape materials. 
(Ord. 2007-26 § 1 (part), 2007: Ord. 2001-23). 
3.7 - Trees. 
3.7.1  The minimum number of trees shall be one (1) tree per four hundred (400) square feet of landscape area. Additional trees are required if the number of trees for parking areas and along right-of-way areas as described in subsections 3.7.1.1 and 3.7.1.2 exceed this minimum. The Director may modify this standard for public uses such as parks. 
1.  Included in the minimum required number of trees, a minimum of one (1) shade tree must be planted for every ten (10) parking spaces or fraction thereof, and distributed throughout the parking area surface to provide even shading within the parking lot. For example, eighteen (18) parking spaces shall require two (2) trees. A minimum of one (1) deciduous tree shall be placed in each standard sized parking island. 
2.  Included in the minimum required number of trees, at least one (1) tree shall be placed along the right-of-way frontage for every thirty (30) lineal feet of right-of-way at a point not more than twenty (20) feet from the right-of-way.

4.8 - Requirements for billboards and off-premises signs. 
4.8.1  Name. This chapter shall be called the off-premises sign regulations. 
4.8.2  Findings. 
a.  Comprehensive Regulation of Off-Premises Advertising. The Board finds and declares that the purpose of developing requirements for billboards and off-premises signs is to establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of the time, manner and place of the commercial use of billboards and off-premises signs and the gradual elimination of nonconforming off-premises signs through attrition and natural deterioration. Illegal billboards and off-premises signs are public nuisances, and unless the status is changed under this chapter to nonconformance, shall be removed and abated in the manner provided by law. It is intended that these regulations: 
(1)  Impose reasonable standards on the number (density), size, height and location of billboards and off-premises signs and facilitate removing or bringing into conformance existing illegal and nonconforming billboards and off-premises signs in order to: 
(a)  Prevent and relieve distraction and clutter resulting from excessive and confusing billboard displays, 
(b)  Safeguard and enhance property values, 
(c)  Achieve the objectives of the Carson City Master Plan, and 
(d)  Promote the public safety and general welfare; 
(2)  Provide one (1) of the tools essential to the preservation and enhancement of the environment, thereby protecting an important aspect of the economy of Carson City which is instrumental in attracting those who come to live, visit, vacation and trade; 
(3)  Eliminate hazards to pedestrian and motorists brought about by distracting and/or unsafe billboards and off-premises signs; 
(4)  Improve, enhance and preserve the appearance and other aesthetic qualities of Carson City. 
b.  Findings and Purpose Supplementary to Other Chapters. These findings are supplementary to other statements of findings and purpose contained in this Division. 
c.  Commercial Use Defined. Commercial use of billboards and signs, as used in this chapter, means and includes, without limitation, the use of signs having some or all of the characteristics and purposes listed in this section. These characteristics and purposes tend to describe the business practices and other arrangements of the persons who are engaged in the business of off-premises advertising, or of persons who use off-premises advertising in connection with their business and nonbusiness advertising, and therefore tends to describe the types of signs intended to be regulated by this chapter. 
(1)  Signs on which advertising space is sold, leased, given or otherwise made available by the sign owner to other members of the public at large for the purpose of displaying the other person's message. The sign owner may or may not, but typically does, receive revenue or other value or benefits for allowing other persons to use the advertising space. The sign owner may or may not, but typically does not, own the land occupied by the sign; 
(2)  Signs which do not advertise the interests of the person who owns or occupies the land on which the sign is located, but which do advertise the interests of persons elsewhere. The sign message is determined by the sign owner or his lessee without regard for, and sometimes adverse to, the interests of the owners of the sign site; 
(3)  Signs owned and controlled by a person other than the person who owns or controls the land on which the sign is located; 
(4)  Signs which advertise interests or uses not present at the location of the sign; 
d.  No Preferences Allowed to Particular Types of Messages. 
(1)  Commercial use under this chapter is not determined by making reference to the content of the sign message to determine whether the sign advertises a commercial message or a noncommercial message. Noncommercial messages are those usually considered to be, for example, ideological, religious or political in nature. A noncommercial message does not cause a billboard or off-premises sign to no longer be a "commercial use" under this chapter. Commercial use is determined by making reference to the overall practices and arrangements of the sign owners and sign site owners in making the sign available to others. 
(2)  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to allow a commercial message any preference or greater protection over a noncommercial message, or to allow one (1) noncommercial message any preference or greater protection over another noncommercial message. Any reference to the message content of a billboard or off-premises sign, to the limited extent such reference is necessary, is made for the sole purpose of classifying and segregating the two basic types of signs regulated in this Division: 
(a)  Signs subject to the requirements of Division 4.8 and which are known variously as off-premises, off-site, nonappurtenant, nonaccessory, "outdoor advertising" or "billboards"; 
(b)  Signs subject to the other sections of Division 4 and which are known variously as on-premises, on-site, appurtenant, accessory and "business" signs.

e.  Zoning of the Sign Site. The location of a sign must be zoned: 
(1)  General Commercial; or 
(2)  General Industrial. 
f.  Spacing Distance from Other Off-Premises Signs. A sign may not be closer than one thousand (1,000) feet in any direction to another billboard or off-premises sign.

(5)  Lights which simulate or create the effect of motion or which change numbers or letters are not allowed on a sign. 
4.8.4  Existing Signs-Allowed to Continue in Existence Subject to Requirements. 
a.  Special Use Permits for the continuance of a nonconforming sign are subject to denial or approval in accordance with the requirements for new signs as set forth in Section 4.8.3. 
b.  A Special Use Permit for continuance of a nonconforming sign may not be denied on account of a sign failing to comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  The spacing distance specified in Section 4.8.3.(f) 
(2)  The setback distance from certain zoning areas and uses specified in Sections 4.8.3(h) and (i). 
(3)  The zoning requirement in Section 4.8.3(e). 
c.  Any order to remove a sign adjacent to a primary or interstate highway is not effective unless the order has been submitted to the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) for review and the Department has determined that the removal will not subject the State to highway funding penalty provided for in Title 23, United States Code, Section 131. 
4.8.5  Maintenance and Repair of Signs. 
a.  Reestablishment or Repair of Nonconforming Sign after Major Damage. A sign which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter for new signs may be continued in existence, repaired and maintained subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  A sign damaged by storm, fire, wind, lightning, earthquake or other natural causes, or negligence of a person to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of its depreciated replacement cost shall not be repaired or reestablished. 
(a)  The extent of damage is determined by the cost to repair, rebuild and reestablish the damaged physical components of the sign in conformance with the Building Code as currently adopted by Carson City, so as to make the sign able to display the same sign face as existed before the damage. 
(b)  The depreciated replacement cost is determined by the cost (to the same person who would perform the repair and rebuilding using the same materials, labor and equipment as would be used in the repair and rebuilding of the damaged sign) to build and replace the sign new, less depreciation. 
(c)  The costs are limited to the costs of the physical components of the sign and the cost of labor and equipment in performing work on those components. 
(d)  In comparing the costs of damage (subsection (a)(1)(a) of this section) to the depreciated replacement cost (subsection (a)(1)(b) of this section) like materials, like equipment and like labor shall be compared in order to make a valid and consistent comparison. New materials may not be compared to used materials; free or low-cost materials may not be compared to full-price materials, personal labor may not be compared to hired labor; sign owner-supplied labor or equipment may not be compared to contractor-supplied labor or equipment; inconsistent cost comparisons of any kind are not allowed in making the determinations required by this section. 
(e)  If the building official determines that the professional services of an engineer, appraiser, cost estimator, contractor or other appropriate person are necessary to determine the extent of damage and the depreciated replacement cost, he shall notify the owner of the sign who, as a condition of applying for a building permit to perform work on the damaged sign, shall acknowledge the owner's responsibility to pay reasonable fees incurred as a result thereof. No permit of the repair, rebuilding or reestablishment of the sign may be issued until the fees have been paid by the owner. 
b.  Building Permit Exemptions for Nonstructural Work. Building permits are not required for: 
(1)  Painting or changing of copy on the display surface. 
(2)  Maintenance and repair work involving superficial, essentially nonstructural work such as painting, applying liquid preservatives, replacing light bulbs, tightening and adding fasteners, replacing walking deck, skirting, display panels, border trim on poster panels and similar work that does not involve additions, deletions, reinforcement, replacement, substitution or other changes of structural components that support the display surface of a sign, or which involve a change in materials, design or configuration of the original structural design. 
(3)  Appendages or cut-outs if: 
(a)  The added sign area of the addition is not greater than ten percent (10%) of the area of the maximum display surface set forth in Section 4.8.3(g); and 
(b)  The addition does not extend more than two (2) feet in height above the maximum height limitation set forth in Section 4.8.3(c). 
c.  Building Permits Required for Structural Work. Building permits are required for any work involving additions, deletions, reinforcement, replacement, substitution or other changes of structural components that support the display surface of a sign, or any work involving a change in materials, or configuration of the original structural design. 
4.8.6  Applicability of Other Laws-Severability. 
a.  If other chapters of the Development Standards, Title 18, or state or federal laws impose more restrictive requirements on the construction of new signs or on the continuance of existing signs, the more restrictive law shall apply except: 
(1)  Removal of a nonconforming sign is not required if the only nonconformities are the excepted requirements of Section 4.8.3(e); and 
(2)  A more restrictive requirement shall not apply if the requirement violates the prohibitions against giving preferences or greater protection for particular messages, as described in Section 4.8.2, so as to avoid violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
b.  In the event the administrative and other chapters of Title 18 or the Development Standards are invalidated, the procedures and requirements provided for performing work on buildings and structures generally as provided for in other titles, chapters or divisions of this code shall apply to work performed on a sign. 
c.  If any provision of this Division is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or unconstitutional, it shall in no way affect the remainder of this chapter or any section thereof, it being intended that the remainder shall remain in full force and effect. 
4.8.7  Off-Premises Signs located on City Bus Shelters 
a.  Notwithstanding the prohibitions included in Section 4.5, Restricted and/or Prohibited Signs, Subsection 4.5.1, Signs on Trees, Shrubs, Traffic Control Signs, or Utility Poles, which prohibit signs on any structure within the right-of-way, this section authorizes the placement of off-premises advertising signs on authorized Carson City bus shelters located within the right-of-way and on private property.

4.9 - Freeway-oriented sign standards. 
4.9.1  Purpose. Carson City finds that the limited use of on-premise signs for certain existing and proposed commercial land uses is an appropriate means to help achieve economic sustainability. Carson City also recognizes that there must be a balance between the needs of the business community and the desire of citizens to preserve view corridors along the freeway. To achieve this balance, these guidelines are a means to allow freeway signage that is well designed, appropriately sited, and to the extent possible, esthetically pleasing. These standards are to be utilized in evaluating requests for freeway-oriented signs. 
    The purpose of these guidelines is to: 
a.  Encourage development of property in harmony with the desired character of the city while providing due regard for the public and private interests involved. 
b.  Promote the effectiveness of freeway-oriented signs by preventing the over concentration, improper placement, deterioration, and excessive size and number. 
c.  Enhance the flow of traffic and the convenience, ease and enjoyment of travel along the freeway. 
d.  Protect travelers on Carson City's freeway from injury or damage as a result of distraction or obstruction of vision attributable to large signs. 
e.  Assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of the freeway and other public structures and spaces shall be protected by exercising reasonable control over the character and design of large sign structures. 
f.  Require that signs be properly maintained for safety and visual appearance. 
4.9.2  Applicability. The standards contained in this section (4.9) shall apply to all freeway-oriented signs as defined in this chapter. 
4.9.3  General Provisions. 
a.  A maximum of one freeway-oriented sign may be permitted per parcel or shopping center in addition to other permitted on-premise signs and sign area. 
b.  Signs with more than four tenant spaces shall include the shopping center or project name on the sign, which shall be located on the uppermost portion of the sign and shall occupy a minimum of twenty percent of the permitted sign area. 
4.9.4  Location and Siting. A freeway-oriented sign may only be located: 
a.  On a parcel or shopping center site which has frontage on the freeway right-of-way, and only between the freeway intersection at North Carson Street and 1,500 feet west of the freeway intersection at South Carson Street; and 
b.  On a parcel or shopping center site that is either: 
(1)  At least 15 contiguous acres in area; or 
(2)  At least three contiguous acres within 500 feet of a freeway intersection; or 
(3)  At least three contiguous acres located on the corner with frontage on both the freeway and the cross-street; and 
c.  On property zoned General Commercial, Retail Commercial or Limited Industrial; and 
d.  No more than 200 feet from the right-of-way line of the adjacent freeway; and 
e.  A distance of no less than ten times the proposed height of the sign in relation to the ground elevation at the property line of the nearest residentially zoned property, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.9.8. 
4.9.5  Design and Construction. A freeway-oriented sign shall be designed and built: 
a.  No higher than reasonably necessary in order for the sign copy to be visible from a vehicle approaching on the same side of the freeway as determined by a line-of-site analysis and in no case more than 30 feet above the highest freeway improvement immediately adjacent to the proposed sign, including freeway barriers and soundwalls but excluding light fixtures and sign structures; and 
b.  Having a form, texture, color, and finish that incorporates representations complimentary to the primary architectural or natural features of the associated development or feature; and 
c.  Having low maintenance, architectural-grade surfacing materials such as metal, masonry, ceramic tile, glass or stucco; and 
d.  Having a sign area determined by the lesser of: 
(1)  One square foot of sign area for each two lineal feet of freeway right-of-way frontage or one square foot of sign area for each lineal foot of building frontage facing the freeway right-of-way, whichever is greater; or 
(2)  50 square feet per acre of parcel; or 
(3)  600 square feet; and 
e.  Limiting nighttime illumination to just the sign copy or sign message. Internally illuminated signs shall have opaque backgrounds so that only the sign copy is illuminated. Where a background is integral to the design of a corporate image or registered trademark, the background is to be colored to mute the amount of illumination. Vacant or blank tenant sign panels shall be blocked out. 
f.  To be located appropriately on the site for visibility from the freeway while minimizing the sign height in accordance with this section. 
4.9.6  Exterior Illumination. A freeway-oriented sign composed of exposed neon, argon or krypton tubing, exposed incandescent lighting, or other exposed artificial lighting to outline such sign or portion thereof, is permitted provided such illumination: 
a.  Constitutes a design component of the overall sign architecture; and 
b.  Is integrated into the primary physical elements of sign and is harmonious with the architectural style of the structure; and

Division 5 - HISTORIC DISTRICT 
Sections: 

PREFACE 
    Carson City's historic district is often thought of as a "Victorian Village" frozen in time. Nothing could be further from the truth. Carson City's historic district reflects a unique variety of ongoing economic, social and political circumstances. The district provides a link with Nevada's past through historic buildings dating from the early 1860's to the 1950's. Modest in scale, means and architectural pretense, these buildings document Nevada's development as a state and give Carson City its unique character. 
    The value of Carson City's historic resources was formally recognized by the Carson City board of supervisors in May 1982 with the creation of the historic district and the designation of an architecture review committee. Renamed the historic resources commission (HRC), it is comprised of property owners, building, design, and preservation professionals. By ordinance, the Carson City historic resources commission is charged with maintaining the overall architectural character of the district and properties listed or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places within the guidelines recommended by the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service. Carson City adopted these guidelines to protect and preserve its heritage. 
    The commission recognizes that Carson City's future prosperity lies in a balanced approach to economic development and historic preservation. These objectives are not mutually exclusive. The commission realizes that it is necessary to maintain a balance between preservation and utility. 
    This section explains the review policies and design guidelines of the commission when reviewing projects within the district, whether involving historic structures or new construction. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005). 

5.1 - Introduction. 
    The architectural styles found in Carson City's historic district span approximately 100 years from the 1860s to the 1960s. Examples of ten architectural styles found in the historic district were selected. Less common styles in the district have not been included, however, the buildings representing these styles are equally important to the district's character. 
    Between the city's founding in 1858, and 1874, the Greek Revival and Gothic Revival styles were popular. After 1874 four "Victorian" period styles were adopted: the ltalianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne and Stick/Eastlake styles. By the turn of the century, changing architectural fashions prompted period revivals and "modern" architecture. The period revivals included: Colonial, Classical, Mediterranean and English Country. The modern styles included the Bungalow Craftsman, a uniquely American creation, and Art Deco/Modern. These styles were popular in Carson City up to World War II. 
    Architectural styles form a system which describes the design of the building - its scale, mass, proportions, height, rhythm and ground plan - and the architectural details - such as roofline, exterior cladding, windows, entrances, ornamentation and interior features. A house of a particular style is not just a random collection of parts; all the design elements work together to form a specific image. 
    Most buildings do not possess all the characteristics of a particular style. Carson City buildings are vernacular interpretations of architectural styles which include the essential form of the style and selected details. Many houses within the historic district reflect the influence of more than one style. For example, a house which was built in the 1860s may have the form of the Greek Revival style, but the original form was enlarged and embellished in the 1880s with Italianate style ornamentation. Similarly, a house constructed in the 1880s could combine the popular Queen Anne and the Stick/Eastlake styles in its design. 
    The designs of a large number of buildings within the historic district do not fall into a discrete style. These "vernacular" houses provided basic shelter for their occupants and were probably built without much regard for the current architectural fashion. These buildings are important to the ambience of the historic district and provide us with a balance between the modest and the spectacular. Vernacular houses represent building traditions handed down from one generation to another modified by technology, local building materials and geography. Their basic design and modest details are their identifying features. 
    The character-defining features of a particular house should be recognized and protected through maintenance and rehabilitation. Features which define a building's style and character also contribute to the overall character of the historic district. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.2 - Greek Revival (1850 to 1870). 
    Classically inspired architecture developed as an outgrowth of our country's desire to distance its culture from England after the War of 1812. In architecture, classical Greece and Rome became the new inspiration and Nevada adopted these prototypes in the latter part of this era through the Greek Revival style. During this period Greek temples were regarded as the perfect building forms and the character defining features were applied to American residences. 
    The typical Carson City, Greek Revival house is rectangular or L-shaped in ground plan, is 1 or 1.5 stories, and has clapboard or shiplap siding. A characteristic feature is the gable roof with the gable facing front to emulate the Greek Temple form. Its ornamentation is classical in its derivation as evidenced by plain, boxed cornices with eave returns, simplified columns and in some case, metopes and tryglyphs. Windows are commonly six-over-six light, double hung with cornice molding. The typical entrance in this style includes a paneled door with transom and sidelights. Front porches are common. 
    There is no dominant floor plan, front facade fenestration pattern, or porch type associated with Greek Revival residences in Carson City. Greek Revival appears to be the most popular pre-Victorian period style for residential construction. Many houses in the vernacular of the Greek Revival style include ornamentation from the Italianate style. 

    Built in 1862 by a Carson City carpenter named Smaill, this house, at 512 North Curry Street, is one of the finest Greek Revival styled houses in Carson City. Its ornamentation is Classical Greek and suggests a designer familiar with Classical architecture. Its frieze with tryglyphs and metopes is unique in Carson City. Its basic form and detailing is typical of the Greek Revival style. Other Carson City examples of Greek Revival include 304 West 5th Street, 108 North Minnesota Street and 406 North Mountain Street.

(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.3 - Gothic Revival (1850 to 1875). 
    Inspired by the romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19 centuries, the Gothic Revival style came to America from England. Proponents proclaimed the superiority of the Christian medieval past and sought to replace the formal, pagan Greek and Roman architectural styles. 
    Made popular by the designs of architect Alexander Jackson Davis through the pattern books of landscaper and writer Andrew Jackson Downing, the Gothic Revival style was seen as appropriate for the rural American landscape. 
    The Gothic Revival style, introduced to Nevada in the 1850s, was popular through the 1870s for residential design and until the early 20th century for church design. 4 of Carson City's churches built during this period include elements of the Gothic Revival style: First Presbyterian Church (1862-64), First United Methodist Church (1865), St. Peter's Episcopal Church (1867-68), and St. Teresa of Avila Catholic Church (1870-71). All 4 churches have Gothic or pointed arch windows: some very plain, some elaborate with tracery and stained glass. 
    The Gothic Revival style is distinguished by the pointed arch (used with doors, windows, entries, etc.) and its elaborate woodwork. The invention of the jigsaw allowed builders to produce an endless variety of fancy wooden details-"gingerbread"-cheaply and quickly. These wooden decorative embellishments are found on Gothic Revival style buildings in the form of bargeboards, pendants, finials, brackets, and other ornamentation. 

    The J.D. Roberts house, built in Washoe City in 1859 and moved to its present location at 1206 North Carson Street in 1873, is Carson City's finest residential example of the Gothic Revival style. Note the following characteristic elements of Gothic Revival: steeply pitched, cross gabled roof; bargeboard decorating the gable ends: and pointed arch or "Gothic" windows. Another domestic Gothic Revival style building in Carson City is the Ormsby-Rosser house at 304 South Minnesota Street.

(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.4 - Italianate (1875 to 1900). 
    The Italianate style was derived from the rural architecture of northern Italy and came to the United States via England as part of the Picturesque movement. The Picturesque movement was a reaction to the earlier classically influenced styles and includes both the Gothic Revival and the Italianate architectural styles. Introduced into the United States during the 1830s, the Italianate style dominated American domestic architecture between 1850 and 1880. Its popularity was spread by the pattern books of landscaper and writer Andrew Jackson Downing, who utilized the designs of architect Alexander Jackson Davis. 
    ltalianate style buildings are identified by heavy, wooden cornices, window surrounds and door overhangs. Window bays, cupolas, and entry hoods also are typical of the style. Roofs are typically low, hipped or gabled and finished with a boxed cornice. Windows are tall and narrow. 
    Carson City has several Italianate styled houses. Many houses designed from the 1870s and 1880s combine some Italianate style influences along with other styles. Earlier houses also include Italianate style features, probably resulting from remodeling in the late 1870s or 1880s. A larger number of Italianate residences survive in Virginia City. 

    The Lou Meder house located at 308 North Nevada Street was built circa 1875 and is an excellent example of the Italianate style in Carson City. The house has the typical heavy boxed cornice with double brackets and dentils; a paneled entry with recessed door under a hood; and characteristic square window bays. This house is 1 story while most houses in this style are 2 or 3 stories adding to the vertical emphasis. Another Italianate example is the Rinckel Mansion at 102 North Curry Street.

(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.5 - Second Empire (1860 to 1880). 
    The Second Empire style originated in France and took its name from the reign of Napoleon III (1852-1870). Considered a "modern" style, its most identifying feature is the mansard or dual-pitched hipped roof introduced by 17th century French architect Francois Mansart. The boxy roofline allows a full story of usable attic space. 
    This style is characterized by: a mansard roof; roof dormers; decorative patterns of color or texture in the roofing material-often wooden shingles of different cuts; and a tower with a curved roofline. Below the roof, Second Empire styled houses may borrow many of the characteristics of the Italianate style including: heavy wooden cornices, window surrounds and door overhangs; tall and narrow windows, window bays, cupolas and entry hoods. 
    The Second Empire style was popular in the United States between 1860 and 1880. Used for many public buildings during President Grant's administration (1869-77) it is sometimes referred to as the General Grant style. The Second Empire style was not widely used in the west and rapidly declined in popularity following the panic of 1873. Nevada's most prominent Second Empire public building is the Fourth Ward School (1876) in Virginia City. 

    The Beck-Barber-Belknap house, 1206 North Nevada Street, is 1 of 3 extant Second Empire styled houses in Carson City. Built in 1875 by H.H. Beck, the house was later owned from 1881 to 1908 by Supreme Court Justice Charles Belknap. The Second Empire styled house has the characteristic mansard roof with arched hooded dormers. Eave lines are decorated with brackets and dentils. A full front width porch and square window bays further enhance the design. The 2 other examples of the Second Empire style in Carson City are 1112 North Carson Street and 503 East Telegraph Street.

5.6 - Stick (1875 to 1895). 
    The Stick style was promoted through period pattern books along with the Italianate and Second Empire styles but never gained the popularity of the other styles. Stick style architecture is defined by decorative stickwork applied to the wall planes rather than applied to windows, doors, cornices, etc. The Stick style was used to express the structure of the building through its ornamentation on the exterior walls. Wall ornamentation imitated corner posts, studs, brackets, bracing and other structural elements. A typical Stick style house would include some of the following features: steeply pitched, gabled or cross-gabled roof; decorative trusses at the gables; overhanging eaves supported by simple brackets; horizontal board siding with stickwork decoration - patterns of horizontal, vertical or diagonal boards raised from the wall surface; and porches with diagonal braces. 

    112 North Curry Street is a Carson City example of the Stick style. Although not a strict Stick style design, this building has a tall corner tower decorated with diagonal Stickwork ornamentation and diagonal braces decorating the front porch. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.7 - Queen Anne (1880 to 1905). 
    The Queen Anne style has little to do with England's Queen Anne or the style of formal Renaissance architecture popular during her reign in the 18th century. The style was named and popularized in England by a group of architects led by Richard Norman Shaw. The most popular domestic style of architecture during the last 2 decades of the 19th century, the Queen Anne is conspicuously eclectic and romantic. It is decoratively rich with bright colors and a generous variety of exterior wall textures. The Queen Anne house is typically asymmetrical and large with multi-gabled roofs and tall, decorated chimneys. Towers with conical roofs and turrets protrude from corners. The style frequently uses: a multiplicity of window types including rectangular, oval, round, square; slanted and square bays; and oriels. Wrap around veranda and porches with turned posts are typical of the Queen Anne style. 
    There are many variations of the Queen Anne style in the United States. Some are based on different roof types and others are based on various types of ornamentation. Throughout the United States about half of the Queen Anne houses are ornamented with spindlework. Spindlework, delicately turned wooden pieces, were used as porch balustrades, porch friezes and in gables. About 1/3 of the Queen Anne houses in this country used Classical ornamentation. Classical columns replaced posts with spindlework: Palladian windows, cornice line-dentils and other classical details were also employed. 2 other expressions of the Queen Anne style not typical to Carson City include half-timbered work and patterned masonry. 
    Related to the Queen Anne style is the Princess Anne style: a slightly later and subdued derivative of the popular Queen Anne style. Princess Anne style houses retain the asymmetrical plan and mass, multiple gables, and tall, decorated chimneys. In keeping with the 20th century move towards more restrained decoration, the Princess Anne style is less ornamented and does not include the characteristic towers, turrets, and verandahs of its progenitor. 
    The Queen Anne Cottage style is derived from the Queen Anne style. This smaller version (usually 1 or 1.5 stories) first appeared in the 1880s and was ideally suited for smaller city lots. It retains the asymmetrical massing of the large Queen Anne and is dominated by a tall gabled roof. Ornamentation is usually confined to the gable end. Typically a front window bay, corner porch and a variety of window types are included. 

    The Springmeyer House located at 302 North Minnesota Street is a rare Carson City example of the Queen Anne style. Built in 1908 by H. H. Springmeyer, a member of the Douglas County ranching family, the house is also known as the home of Governor and Mrs. Charles Russell. Typical of the Queen Anne style, this house has both clapboard and shingle siding; gabled, hipped, and conical roof forms; asymmetrical massing; a roof dormer with balcony; and a slanted bay.

5.8 - Colonial & Classical Revival (1895 to 1915). 
    At the end of the ornate Victorian period, American builders sought new inspiration for 20th century residential design. As suburban living became the norm for an increasing number of Americans, earlier and more rural building forms and styles from both the United States and Europe were chosen as prototypes. 2 stylistic movements grew in the early 20th century: the "Picturesque" Period Revival and the Modern movement. 
    The World's Columbian Exposition held in 1893 in Chicago was built with a classical theme and started this architectural revival in classical forms. Colonial and Classical Revival styles were dominant for residential building in many parts of the country in the first part of the 20th century, but few Classical and Colonial Revival houses were built in Carson City. 
    The Colonial Revival style is a restrained, dignified, and harmonious style, uniquely American, based Colonial styles which, in turn, were influenced by Classical Roman designs. The typical Colonial Revival style design is a large, two storied, rectangular-in-plan structure with a paucity of exterior projections from its symmetrical facade. A centrally placed entrance is the major focus of the design. The door is commonly framed by sidelights and topped with a fanlight. A portico may cover the entrance. Windows are double hung; Palladian windows are a popular feature. The hipped roof is moderately pitched and includes a projecting cornice ornamented with modillions and dentils. Classical, fluted pilasters, quoins or cornerboards ornament the corners. 
    The identifying feature of the Classical Revival include: a dominating full-height porch with roof support by classical columns; columns with Ionic or Corinthian capitals; central door; and symmetrical facade. 
    The most prominent Classical Revival style house in Carson City is the Governor's Mansion at 600 North Mountain Street. Built in 1909 as the Governor's Mansion the large symmetrical building is ornamented with a pedimented front porch supported with fluted columns with Ionic capitals; a projecting cornice with modillions and classically inspired door and window moldings. 

    Pictured above is a fine Carson City example of the Colonial Revival style. Built in 1915, the Ira I. Winters house at 600 North Richmond Avenue is sometimes called a Classic Box; the house is a 2-story, rectangular-in-plan box topped with a hipped roof. The front dormer, the 1 story full width porch, and the quoins are all typical to the Colonial Revival. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.9 - Bungalow/Craftsman (circa 1905 to 1930). 
    Moving toward a modern lifestyle, the architects that popularized the Craftsman and Bungalow styles were among the first to emphasize comfort and convenience, concepts of human scale and sensible plans. Their designs helped shape a growing phenomenon of the time: the affordable small house for the middle class. The designs (in wood or brick) provided an easy to build, affordable house for the growing middle-class, who were moving to the suburban fringe of cities. The homes were also the first to include a detached garage. 
    The Craftsman style represented an independent western movement in American architecture. Its guiding force was the English Arts and Crafts movement, which rejected the mass reproduction and mediocre design associated with the Industrial Revolution in favor of the beauty and "honesty" of traditional handcraftsmanship and natural materials. The Craftsman ideas were widely disseminated in the pages of the Craftsman magazine, published from 1901 to 1916 by the furniture maker and designer Gustave Stickley. The style was adapted for countless small houses and bungalows but found its most sophisticated expression in the work of Pasadena architects Greene and Greene. Craftsman details often included inglenooks, built-in wood cabinets, wood beam ceilings and large fireplaces. 
    The Bungalow is often affiliated with the Craftsman but also may be influenced by Japanese, chalet and period styles. The Bungalow is typically a snug 1.5 story home with wide overhanging roof, deep porch and simple interior with built-in cupboards. The interior floor plan differs little from prior architectural styles with floor plans divided into small distinct rooms. 1 exception was the inclusion of a plumbed bathroom. Other conveniences such as central heating, electricity and gas ranges were becoming standard during this period. 

    The Craftsman Bungalow was the dominant residential building style in the United States between 1905 and 1920. The house at 202 North Curry Street, illustrated above, is a typical example. Note the exposed rafter ends, the purlins decorating the gable end, the 3 part windows with four-lights-over-one-light and the typical front porch with typical elephantine posts on piers. Also, 502 West Spear Street is an excellent example of a brick Bungalow and is similar to the brick Bungalows prevalent in southwest Reno. Few examples of the style survive in Carson City.

(Ord. 205-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.10 - Period Revival (1900 to 1940). 
    In an era of major social and cultural change, Period Revival houses were designed to conjure up the romantic times and far away places of another "period" in history. Popular styles from the past include the English Cottage, Tudor Revival, Dutch Colonial, Country Cottage, Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Colonial. There are "high-style" examples which include all the major elements of a particular style, and vernacular examples which may incorporate only one or two elements into the design. Modest examples of the English Cottage and the Mediterranean styles are found in Carson City's historic district. 
5.10.1  English Cottage Revival. The English Cottage style is the most modest of the English Revivals, which were popular in America between 1910 and 1930. The prototype of the English Cottage is the masonry rural farmhouse of England. This quaint and charming, typically 1 story cottage is usually constructed of stone, stucco or brick construction. Distinguishing features include an asymmetrical composition, a steeply pitched roof with little overhang and a steeply pitched front entrance. Large expanses of wall are pierced by relatively few windows. 
5.10.2  Mediterranean Revival. The key to distinguishing the Mediterranean Revival style is its heavy tile roof and restrained ornamentation. The structures are generally wood frame construction with a smooth or textured stucco wall surface painted white or a light color. Ornamentation is restrained; wall surfaces are flat with few projections. Windows are casements and framed by wooden or wrought iron grills. Small, second story balconies are typical. The Mediterranean Revival style was used for public, commercial and residential structures. 

    500 West Telegraph Street, built in 1926, is an example of the Mediterranean Revival style of domestic architecture. Although remodeled, the residence maintains key stylistic features of the style: a heavy red tile roof, a corner tower with hipped roof, white stucco walls and round arched openings. An example of the English Cottage style is 1008 North Curry Street. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.11 - Ranch Style (1940 to 1960). 
    The Ranch house was perhaps the ultimate symbol of the postwar American dream: a safe, affordable home promising efficiency and elegant, casual living inspired by California's temperate climate. California architects, such as Cliff May introduced the "A close-to-the-ground" ranch in the 1930s, evidently finding inspiration in the 1-story plan of the Spanish rancho of the Southwest. By the late 1940s, this new house type had caught on across the country and still remains popular. After World War II, the popularity of the Ranch house increased, especially with dependence on the automobile and newly constructed suburban neighborhoods. In the West, where land was available, the new large lots provided plenty of room for a rambling, 1-story plan, driveway, garage and expanse of green lawn. 
    The classic Ranch is a rectangular or L-shaped house whose low-pitched roof caps an open, free-flowing plan. The house is typically long, narrow, and low to the ground, with a strong emphasis on the horizontal. The roof is usually hipped with wide overhanging eaves. The Ranch style also features wide porches, large patios or interior courtyards, a de-emphasis of the main entrance, integral garage, large windows, and use of native materials, especially masonry as accents. The use of large glass windows or glass walls suggests the connection to the outside. 
    The interior of the Ranch house also differs dramatically from earlier styles by diminishing the boundaries between formal and informal spaces. Ranch houses might still have a formal living room based on the parlor concept, but more often the dining room was situated between the kitchen and the new "family" room. With its open kitchen/living area, the ranch was specifically geared to casual entertaining. Another key point was the desirable indoor/outdoor living promised by the one-story layout, which features sliding glass doors, picture windows, terraces and patios secluded in a rear yard. 
5.11.1  Minimal Traditional (1935 to 1950). With the economic Depression of the 1930s came this compromise style which reflects the form of traditional Eclectic houses, but lacks their decorative detailing. Roof pitches are low or intermediate and eaves and rake close, rather than overhanging. Usually, but not always, the design incorporates a large chimney and at least 1 front-facing gable. Many examples suggest Tudor cottages with the roof line lowered and detailing removed. These houses were built in great numbers in the years immediately preceding and following World War II. 

    A modest example of a period revival home on West Robinson St. 
5.11.2  Ranch (1940 to 1975). Asymmetrical 1-story shapes with low-pitched roofs in one of 3 forms: hipped (the most common), cross-gabled and side-gabled. There is usually a moderate or wide eave overhang. This may be either boxed or open, with the rafters exposed as in Craftsman houses. Both wooden and brick wall cladding are used, sometimes in combination. Builders frequently add modest bits of traditional detailing, usually loosely based on Spanish or English Colonial precedents, such as decorative iron or wooden porch supports and shutters. Ribbon windows are frequent as are large picture windows in living areas. These private outdoor living areas to the rear of the house are a direct contrast to the large front and side porches of most late 19th and early 20th century styles. 

    A typical Ranch style home in Carson City. This is located on King Street at the periphery of the historic district. 
5.11.3  Split Level (1955 to 1975). The style rose to popularity during the 1950s as a multi-story modification of the then dominant 1-story Ranch house. It retained the horizontal lines, low-pitched roof and overhanging eaves of the Ranch house, but added a 2-story unit intercepted at mid-height by a 1-story wing to make 3 floor levels of interior space. An elaborate theory of interior planning grew around this form. Families were felt to need 3 types of interior spaces: quiet living areas, noisy living and service areas, and a sleeping area. The Split Level form made it possible to locate these on separate levels. The lower level usually housed the garage and, commonly, the "noisy" family room with its television, which was becoming a universal possession. The mid-level wing contained the "quiet" living areas and the upper level the bedrooms.

5.13 - Secretary of interior standards for rehabilitation. 
    Rehabilitation is defined as the process of returning a property to a state of utility, through repair or alteration, which makes possible an efficient contemporary use while preserving those portions and features of the property which are significant to its historic, architectural and cultural values. 
    The standards for rehabilitation are as follows: 
1.  A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces and spatial relationships. 
2.  The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided. 
3.  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken. 
4.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved. 
5.  Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved. 
6.  Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
7.  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
8.  Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
9.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale, proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
10.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.14 - Guidelines for roofs. 
    The roof's shape, the roofing material and its special features are extremely important in defining the building's overall architectural style. Many different historic roof shapes are found in the district: gable, hip, gambrel, mansard, shed and flat. The pitch or slope of the roof changes from style to style. Shed roofs were used extensively for additions to buildings. The type and style of roof features also change with the building style. Brick and stone chimneys, cresting and a variety of dormers are also found in the district. Sawn or milled wood shingles of cedar or redwood are the predominate historic roofing materials within the district. Few tile and no slate roofs have been found. Standing seam or corrugated metal were used on outbuildings. 
5.14.1  Guidelines for Historic Buildings. Original roofing material and features are to be retained and repaired if at all possible. If new roofing is necessary or desired, the preferred treatment is to replace the original with identical new material. If this is not possible or desirable, then the use of Fireclass A, organic felt or fiberglass matt composition type shingle, preferably in a "thick butt" design is acceptable. These are to be laid approximately five inches to the weather with straight and true exposed edge lines. Other roof features such as chimneys, dormers and/or decorative elements are to be retained. New mechanical systems, solar panels, skylights and/or other devices on the roof are to be placed so they are inconspicuous from the Street and in such a manner that no damage is done to any character defining features of the building. (Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation (Standard Number: 2, 6)) 

5.14.2  Guidelines for New Construction. Contemporary roofing materials are available in a wide variety of sizes, materials, colors and designs. The type of building: commercial, residential or accessory to residential is a major factor in determining the appropriate roofing material to use. Today's requirements for fire safety must not be overlooked. Fiberglass matt composition and fire retardant treated sawn/milled wood shingles are the preferred materials for use within the district. Mechanical systems and other devices which are roof mounted are to be designed in such a way that they are not visible from the street and are harmoniously incorporated into the overall building design. 

(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.15 - Guidelines for exterior siding materials. 
    The exterior siding materials found in the district include the full range of materials used in the I 9th to mid 20th centuries. The most typical is a horizontal wood siding. Generally a horizontal "drop" (shiplap) or clapboard was used. It was not uncommon for milled shingles to be utilized to accent gable ends or other similar portions of a structure. Often these shingles were decorative in nature having sculptured ends so that a variety of textural effects could be achieved. The entire structure was never covered with shingles. Mid-century houses used wide shakes and asbestos shingles. A few residences utilized brick, stone, concrete block or stucco. Other exterior sidings include vertical board and batten and corrugated sheet or standing seam metal. These were typically used on outbuildings. Brick, cut stone and rubble stone masonry and/or combinations were used primarily on commercial buildings. Historically, buildings in the district were painted, often in several colors - they were not stained or left "natural." The colors varied and often several colors were used on the same building to highlight the architectural design. Currently, there are paints as well as opaque stains available for exterior finishes. The HRC can provide assistance to owners wishing more information regarding paint and/or stain colors. 

5.15.1  Guidelines for Historic Buildings. The original exterior siding material shall be retained and repaired when at all possible. When replacement is necessary the new material shall match the original in size, design, composition and texture. The use of steel, aluminum and vinyl siding materials is not appropriate for historic buildings. (Standard Number: 6, 2) 
    When contemplating work on the exterior of a historic building, cleaning the existing material should be the first step to determine its condition and a course of action. Cleaning shall be by the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods which cause damage to original historic materials shall not be undertaken. (Standard Number: 7) 
5.15.2  Guidelines for New Construction. New construction within the district needs to be compatible with the historic styles present. The type of building, i.e. residential, outbuilding, or commercial, is a major factor in deciding on an appropriate siding material. Authentic materials such as wood shiplap or clapboard siding are strongly encouraged. Contemporary materials such as masonite or seamless steel are acceptable when sensitively utilized and properly designed and applied. The use of vinyl siding is highly discouraged. (Standard Number: 6) 
5.16 - Guidelines for windows. 
    The majority of buildings in the Historic District are characterized by I 9 century styles of architecture. A basic design characteristic of these styles is symmetrically placed, vertically proportioned windows. Houses built in the 1930s to 1960s used in addition to the above, metal framed windows such as casements and picture windows. 
5.16.1  Guidelines for Historic Buildings. Original windows shall be retained and repaired when at all possible. When replacement is necessary a window of duplicated design shall be used. The size, pane configuration, design and trim shall replicate that of the original. Original trim and surrounds are to be retained when windows are replaced. Bronzed aluminum framed windows are not appropriate for use in a historic building. Stained glass windows were not commonly used in the buildings of the district. Original stained glass windows are very valuable and should be retained. The addition of stained glass windows into openings which did not historically have stained glass is discouraged. (Standard Number: 2, 6) 

5.16.2  Guidelines for New Construction. The overall style of the new building will determine the appropriate design characteristics of the windows to be used. Windows for new buildings emulating 19th or early 20th century designs should emulate one of the 19th or early 20th century window styles and shall be vertically proportioned with a minimum ratio of 2 horizontal to 3 vertical and shall be single or double hung. Windows for new buildings emulating mid-20th century designs should use windows found in designs of those era (c. 1930-1960). The use of smoked, mirrored or tinted glass is not appropriate for use in the district. 

(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.17 - Guidelines for doors. 
    Doors are an important design element of any building. Their location and style contributes to the overall character and frequently act to define the style of the building. Typically even the simplest historic homes have beautifully paneled doors. Original doors have often been replaced by newer inappropriate doors under the false assumption that greater energy efficiency can be achieved. Properly executed repairs and/or replacement of jams, thresholds, stop moldings, hinges and weather stripping will achieve the same energy efficiency and maintain the historic value. Older doors may have dried and shrunk in size. Numerous lock sets, latches and/or strike plates may have been installed in the door. Glass panels may have been removed and replaced with wood or other material. Original doors, however, are probably one of the most easily reconstructed elements of a building. They are generally constructed of high quality materials, most often have design characteristics which are unavailable in today's market and can be easily removed from the building for repairs in a specialized shop. 
5.17.1  Guidelines for Historic Doors. Original doors shall be retained, repaired and replaced in their original locations when at all possible. When replacement is necessary the original shall be matched in color, size, material, design, ornamentation and configuration. The original trim and surround molding should be retained intact and/or duplicated when a door is replaced. (Standard Number 2, 3, 5, 6) 
5.17.2  Guidelines of New Doors in Historic Buildings. The addition of a new door may be warranted for a building to properly function in a modern use. When new doors are to be installed a contemporary design which is sympathetic and harmonious with the original doors shall be used. The placement of the new openings shall not disrupt the original design of the building. (Standard Number: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10) 
5.17.3  Guidelines for Doors in New Construction. The overall style of the new building will determine the appropriate design characteristics of the doors to be used. Doors and entries make a strong design statement for any building. Balance, proportion, rhythm, scale and emphasis must all be considered when determining the style and design of doors. The use of highly ornamented and/or carved wood doors is discouraged. Likewise entry sidelights and/or transom windows should be simple in design. 


  
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.18 - Guidelines for masonry elements. 
    Masonry elements found in the historic district include brick or cut stone foundations, porches and/or basements, and entire stone or brick buildings. Some masonry retaining walls and/or fences are also found. Masonry as an architectural design element generally produces a powerful visual image and imparts a sense of permanence and strength. Careful consideration, therefore, needs to be given all designs which incorporate masonry elements. 
5.18.1  Guidelines for Historic Buildings. The original masonry material shall be retained and repaired when at all possible. When replacement is necessary the new material shall match the original in size, design, composition and texture. Often repointing the original masonry elements is all that is necessary. When repointing, it is imperative to determine the composition of the original mortar. Repointing historic masonry with a contemporary mortar mix containing Portland cement can cause severe damage to the building. Repointing should be accomplished with a mortar that matches the original in color, composition and strength. (Standard Number: 6, 2) 
    NOTE: When contemplating work on the exterior of a historic building, cleaning the existing material should be the first step to determine its condition and a course of action. Cleaning shall be by the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods which cause damage to original historic materials shall not be undertaken. (Secretary of Interior Standard Number: 7) 
5.18.2  Guidelines for New Construction. In contemporary construction, brick or stone is used as a veneer over a wood frame, concrete block or a poured concrete structural frame. When using brick, a wire cut standard red brick with a flush tooled joint is strongly recommended. When using stone, the size, shape, color, texture and style of laying should replicate the visual qualities found in historic construction where the stone composed the major structural element of the building. The use of "culture stone" or other artificial materials is discouraged. 

(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.19 - Guidelines for porches. 
    Porches constitute a significant architectural feature of any building; they are a character defining design feature. The placement, style, scale, massing and trim detail of porches in Carson City reflect a wide range of architectural styles. Because of their architectural impact porches are of particular concern in the historic district. A porch of inappropriate scale, placement and/or design, added to a historic building which did not have a porch originally, can be particularly detrimental to the historic integrity of the building and the character of the district as a whole. Conversely porches can be effectively utilized as a building feature in new construction to create a contemporary architectural design compatible with the historic district's character. 
5.19.1  Guidelines for Historic Buildings. A porch that is part of the original design of a historic building shall be maintained in its original configuration, design, style and detailing if at all possible. If suitable documentary evidence can be presented which demonstrates the original existence of a porch which no longer exists, the porch may be reconstructed to match the original as best as possible. If a porch cannot be demonstrated to have originally existed on the building, a porch may be added with the condition that the configuration, design, style and detailing are suitable and compatible with the architectural style of the building and does not adversely impact the historic integrity of the building. Any new additions to the building shall be performed in such a manner that if removed in the future the original building will not be advers&y affected. (Standard Number: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10) 
5.19.2  Guidelines for New Construction. New construction in the district shall be encouraged to utilize porches as suitable character defining architectural elements. The configuration, design, style and detailing of the porch needs to be suitable and compatible with the architectural style of the building and the buildings in the immediate vicinity. Porches shall not be approved when their design would adversely affect other buildings in the immediate vicinity or the district as a whole, or where the design is obviously incongruous with the building. 
    NOTE: The roof style and slope are critical design elements of a porch. Careful attention to these elements is necessary in both historic and new buildings with porches.

(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.20 - Guidelines for exterior trim details. 
    Although often perceived to be insignificant or frivolous, trim details play a very important part of defining a building's character. Designs for new buildings as well as additions and/or alterations to historic buildings should incorporate the appropriate trim details. The detailing can act to harmonize a building with its neighbor or tie a new addition to the original. Within the architectural styles represented in the district the following exterior trim details can be identified: 
a)  Brackets 
b)  Boxed cornice with eave returns 
c)  Decorated cornice 
d)  Decorated bargeboards 
e)  Quoins 
f)  Corner boards 
g)  Spindle/spool millwork 
h)  Pediments 
i)  Dentils 
j)  Columns 

5.20.1  Guidelines for Historic Buildings. Original trim elements should be retained and repaired when at all possible. Trim that is inconsistent with the original building style and design shall not be added. (Standard Number: 2, 3, 5, 6) 
5.20.2  Guidelines for New Construction. Trim details need to be given careful and thorough consideration in any new building design. They represent a design opportunity for establishing the compatibility of a new building within the context of the district. (Standard Number: 9, 10) 

  
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.21 - Guidelines for additional architectural features. 
    In review of the distinctive architectural features of the styles represented in the district, the following additional architectural features are exhibited. Designs for new buildings as well as additions or alterations to historic buildings can effectively incorporate one or more of the following design elements. 
5.21.1  Dormers can be a very cost effective method of increasing the usable floor space of a building. Often historic buildings are modified by the addition of dormers. Care must be taken when adding dormers to historic buildings that the scale, massing and proportion of the building is not disrupted. In new construction dormers can play a very effective role in harmonizing the contemporary building design with the existing historic styles. (Standard Number: 2, 3, 5, 9, 10) 
5.21.2  Transom Windows. Transom windows over doors, particularly front entry doors, are a common feature of historic buildings in the district. (Standard Number: 2, 3, 5, 9, 10) 
5.21.3  Bay Windows. Bay windows are often a character defining element of a building. As an exterior feature they can often provide a focal component of the design. Proportion, rhythm, scale, symmetry and emphasis are important considerations in the design and placement of a bay window. (Secretary of Interior Standard Number: 2, 3, 5, 9, 10) 
5.21.4  Recessed Door Entries. Recessed door entries are often found in the district. In new construction, recessed entries can play a very effective role in harmonizing the contemporary building design with existing historic styles. (Secretary of Interior Standard Number: 2, 3, 5, 9, 10) 
5.21.5  Barrier Free Handicapped Access. The accommodation of ramps, elevators, lifts and other building elements designed to allow handicapped access can be a difficult design problem. Scale, massing, proportion, detailing and balance all need to be carefully considered. (Secretary of Interior Standard Number: 2, 9, 10) 

  
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.22 - Guidelines for exterior lighting. 
    Exterior lighting in the district is characterized by public fixtures illuminating common areas and private fixtures illuminating signs, yards and buildings. Historically, exterior lighting was generally restricted to illuminating entry and porch areas. Contemporary attitudes have expanded the desire for exterior lighting, and modern technology has provided the ready availability and relatively low cost. 
    The design of exterior lighting involves two elements: the fixture and the illumination pattern produced by the fixture. Both elements need to be considered carefully in the review of any application. The illumination pattern should be functional, but not intrusive on neighbors. New fixtures which provide outdoor flood lighting shall be placed so that they are hidden from view during daylight hours. 
5.22.1  Guidelines for Historic Buildings. The addition of light fixtures and illuminating patterns to historic properties shall be undertaken with sensitivity to the property and its neighbors. Original lighting fixtures and illuminating patterns shall be retained when at all possible. (Secretary of Interior Standard Number: 2, 3, 5, 6) 
5.22.2  Guidelines for New Construction. Exterior lighting in new construction needs to be sensitively designed. Lighting fixtures should reflect the style and design of the new building. The illumination pattern of the lighting should not intrude, but should compliment the building and its environs. (Secretary of Interior Standard Number: 9, 10) 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.23 - Guidelines for signs. 
    Signs in the Historic District are governed by both this Division and Division 4 of the Development Standards. Signage in the Historic District is generally concerned with the conversion of original residential buildings to light office use or with new buildings which have been constructed as commercial buildings in a style compatible with the basic residential nature of the district. 
    All signs must have an appearance, color, size, texture and design which conform to the sign codes and to the historic character of the district. Signs should also closely match stylistically with the architectural style of the building. Additionally, the location and/or method of attachment of the sign will be considered. The HRC will review all sign applications within the context of the building and the location in the district. 
    NOTE: Any sign placed in the district must meet the standards of Division 4 and be approved by the HRC. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.24 - Guidelines for fences. 
    Fences serve a variety of purposes for a property owner. They can define property lines, provide security and protection from trespass, furnish safety for children and pets, provide visual screens for privacy and serve as protection from the elements. The design of a fence is a critical element in the overall visual quality of a property and how it relates to its neighbors. It can also be important from a public safety standpoint, particularly on corner lots. Typically front yards in the district were delineated by low profile, wood picket style fences. A few metal and masonry fences can be found as well. 
    A fence design must be considered in context. Scale, rhythm, material and style are the critical design elements of a fence. The fence design must be compatible with the building as well as with the surrounding property. A fence can provide a delicate design element which will greatly enhance a property. 
5.24.1  Guidelines for Historic Fences. Original fences must be retained and repaired whenever possible. When reconstruction is necessary, the original fence must be matched in color, material, size, scale, texture and composition. New fences should emulate historic styles and designs found in the district. (Standard Number: 2, 4, 5, 6). In accordance with this requirement, and unless an exemption is granted under circumstances deemed appropriate at the discretion of the historic resources commission, when reconstruction of a fence occurs: 
a.  The historic characteristics of the property must be preserved, including, without limitation, any distinctive feature, finish, construction technique or craftsmanship and any individual feature not originally part of the property but which, over time, has acquired historic significance. 
b.  The removal of any historic feature or finish, or the modification or alteration of any such material, feature or finish that contributes to the historic character of the property, is prohibited. 
c.  A deteriorated feature or finish must, whenever possible, be repaired in lieu of replacement. 
d.  A historic feature or finish that has severely deteriorated or is otherwise in a state of disrepair such that replacement in lieu of repair is necessary, the replacement feature or finish must, to the greatest extent possible, match the original feature or finish in material, design, color, texture and all other visual aesthetics. 
5.24.2  Guidelines for New Fences. The appropriate design for a new fence must be determined by its intended function and its location. A new fence must not be constructed in any manner which adversely affects the primary views of any building. A fence should consist of a design that will enhance the overall visual presentation of a building and be made from material which is traditionally associated with fences located within the historic district, including wood, wrought iron, decorative woven wire and, in limited circumstances, masonry. A fence should also contribute to the character and defining features of any building in a positive manner. (Standard Number: 9). Unless an exemption is granted under circumstances deemed appropriate at the discretion of the historic resources commission, the use of vinyl for the construction of a new fence is prohibited. If material other than material which is traditionally associated with fences located within the historic district is proposed to be used for the construction of a new fence, the person proposing the use of such material must include in his or her application to the historic resources commission an explanation describing how the material to be used is: 
a.  Compatible with the massing, size, scale and existing architectural and construction materials of the property and the property site. 
b.  More compatible with the property and the property site than if material which is traditionally associated with fences located within the historic district is used. 
c.  Consistent with the historical features of the property and the property site. 
d.  Consistent with the massing, size, scale and existing architectural and construction materials used within the historic district.

(Ord. No. 2018-1 , § I, 1-18-18) 
5.25 - Guidelines for landscape elements. 
    The Carson City Historic District is characterized by a typical rectangular grid street system without alleys. The streets vary in width, but all are characterized by "L" shaped concrete curbs and gutters, a sidewalk and planting strip between the street and sidewalk. Generally this planting strip contains a row of deciduous trees and lawn. Individual lots are usually rectangular in shape with the main building centered on the parcel and a front setback which allows for a modestly sized front yard. Front yards are typically delineated by a low profile fence, with a gate and walkway leading to the front entry. Accessory buildings are often found in rear yards. These basic elements create a strong visual quality to the district which is consistent and should be encouraged. 2 unique landscape elements in the district are hitching posts (generally of cast iron) and carriage steps (generally of cut stone). These are most likely to be found in the planting strip between the Street and the sidewalk. These should be retained. 
5.25.1  Guidelines for Historic Properties. Historic landscape features should be retained when at all possible. Fences, trees, hitching posts, carriage steps, sidewalks and walkways provide a visual consistency and harmony of setting to the district. (Standards Number: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9) 
5.25.2  Guidelines for New Construction. New construction in the district should include landscape elements which reflect the scale, rhythm, texture, material, color, style and visual qualities of the historic landscape present. (Standard Number: 9, 10) 
5.25.3  Parking Areas. The construction of parking areas in association with commercial development in the district often presents a difficult design task. They need to be designed and located in such a manner that their effect on the district's environs is minimized. They also need to be landscaped with appropriate plant material to provide a visual screen and to soften their impact on the site. 
5.25.4  Satellite Dish Antennas. Satellite dish antennas are an inherently intrusive and incongruous landscape feature in the Historic District. The size, color, texture and location of the dish all contribute to its impact. Dishes shall be placed in the least visible location on the property. A screen of plant material and/or fencing shall also be provided to lessen the visual impact of the installation. 
5.25.5  Sidewalks. See Carson City Municipal Code (CCMC), Development Standards, Division 12.12, Sidewalks, Curb and Gutter, Driveway Approaches, Curb-Cuts, Alleys and Bikeways. 
5.25.6  Landscaping and Trees. See CCMC Development Standards Division 3, Landscaping. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.26 - Guidelines for additions to historic buildings. 
    The primary objective of the Carson City historic resources commission (HRC) is to protect and maintain the integrity of the historic resources in the historic district. However, the commission is committed to provide for the development of these resources in such a manner that does not impair their utility. It is recognized that additions are often necessary for a historic building to become functional in a modern context. It is also recognized that additions must be designed to be compatible and not detract from the building, its immediate surrounding or the district as a whole. 
5.26.1  Guidelines for Additions to Historic Buildings. Additions to historic buildings need to be compatible in their configuration, design, style, scale, materials and architectural details with the distinctive character defining elements of the building. Additions shall be done in such a manner that they do not destroy significant original historical or architectural material, and if removed in the future, will not impair the essential form and integrity of the building nor damage historic fabric. Additions which seek to create an earlier appearance shall not be approved. Additions which are obviously incongruous to the building, or buildings in the immediate vicinity, or the district shall not be approved. (Standard Number: 9, 10) 
5.26.2  Guidelines for Additions to Nonhistoric Buildings. Additions to non-historic buildings in the district will be treated in the same manner as additions to historic buildings, except that maintaining original building fabric will not be a consideration. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
5.27 - Guidelines for new construction. 
    New construction which is appropriately designed is encouraged by the Carson City historic resources commission (HRC). The historic district should be an active and vital part of the city. New construction should look new and reflect the technology, building materials and design ideas of the present era. The design of new construction needs to be compatible and respectful of the historic building stock that surrounds it so that visual conflict and confusion are avoided. There is no formula that will guarantee "good design". There are specific elements of building design which can be identified, and therefore, addressed in a review process so that consistency can be achieved. 
    The following elements shall be individually assessed for their degree of appropriateness for each project. 
5.27.1  Scale and Massing. The overall size and height of the new building should be consistent with the surrounding buildings. 
5.27.2  Shape. The overall shape of the building, particularly its roof type, height, and design emphasis (horizontal or vertical) should be consistent and harmonious with others in the environs. 
5.27.3  Setback. The front and side yard setbacks for the building should be approximately the same as others in the surrounding area and conform with CCMC Development Standards, Division 1, Land Use and Site Design. 5.27.4 Site Elements. When at all possible avoid substantial site alteration by importing or exporting fill materials. Generally speaking vacant lots in the district were once occupied by a building. Attempt to place the new building as near as possible to the same grade as the original. Carefully consider the placement and relationship of the public sidewalk, side and front yard fences, driveway, gardens and accessory buildings when determining the location of the new building on the lot. 
5.27.5  Materials. Exterior siding should reflect the prevailing style of the neighborhood. A vertical or diagonal style siding should not be used when the dominant style is a horizontal drop or shiplap type. The exterior siding should blend in, not stand out. 
5.27.6  Windows and Doors. The rhythm and arrangement of the windows and doors should reflect the style of the building design and the predominant patterns found in existing buildings of the area. The ratio of the total surface area of openings to total wall surface area of new buildings should reflect that of historic buildings in the environs. 
5.27.7  Details and Other Elements. Trim details are often the single most relevant design feature which can be utilized to give harmony and compatibility to a new building. If existing buildings have boxed eaves, do not leave rafter tails exposed. If windows and doors typically have fanciful trim, incorporate trim with architecturally equal weight. If trim work is typically simple, do not use "ginger bread". Seek to design the new building so that the trim and architectural details compliment the existing buildings in the area. 
5.27.8  Floor Elevations. The elevation of the first floor in relation to the street and the finish grade of the lot can often be a critical design feature. For example, if surrounding buildings normally have steps leading from street level up to the first floor level, then the new building should have a similar entrance level. 
    NOTE: It is suggested that each design element outlined in this document be individually reviewed for more specific information. 
(Ord. 2005-23 § 1 (part), 2005: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards).

Division 6 - DOWNTOWN MIXED-USE DISTRICT 
Sections: 

6.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of these development standards is to establish the design-oriented standards for the downtown mixed-use district pursuant to the purposes stated in Title 18, Chapter 18.07, Downtown Mixed-Use District. 
(Ord. 2007-21 § 7 (Exh. A (part)), 2007) 
6.2 - Applicability. 
    These design standards and guidelines shall apply to all new development, infill, redevelopment, signs, exterior modifications and major renovation projects occurring within the DT-MU district, except as provided in Section 6.3, Exemptions, or as otherwise noted within individual sections of this division. If a conflict should arise between the DT-MU district and other sections of this code (as applied to a particular development), the requirements set forth in the DT-MU district shall prevail. 
(Ord. 2007-21 § 7 (Exh. A (part)), 2007) 
6.3 - Exemptions. 
    Exemptions to the regulations contained in this chapter may apply as follows: 
1.  Projects involving only work, maintenance or repairs to the interior of a building or structure and that do not affect exterior appearances are exempt from this chapter. 
2.  Projects involving only ordinary maintenance or the replacement of similar or identical materials of an existing building or structure are exempt from this chapter. 
3.  Parcels, property or structures located within the historic district and subject to review by the historic resource commission are exempt from the design-oriented elements of these standards. 
(Ord. 2007-21 § 7 (Exh. A (part)), 2007) 
6.4 - Downtown character areas. 
    The DT-MU district is comprised of three downtown character areas, the boundaries of which are depicted on the regulating plan-DT-MU district map. The downtown character areas establish a framework for the scale of development that is desired in different locations within downtown. 
    Main Street Mixed-Use. The purpose of the Main Street Mixed-Use character area is to provide opportunities for infill and redevelopment, while retaining the traditional "Main Street" character and scale of Carson Street. To support this objective, building heights will be limited along the Carson Street frontage and adjacent to the State Capitol Complex and other historic structures, but will be permitted to "step up" away from the street-providing for a broader range of development opportunities. Active uses, such as retail shops and restaurants, as well as urban residential units, are desired throughout the character area to promote a lively street environment and expanded hours of activity. 
    Urban Mixed-Use. The purpose of the urban mixed-use character area is to provide for urban-intensity mixed-use development in areas of downtown that contain larger tracts of vacant or underutilized land. It is intended to provide opportunities for concentrations of active uses such as convention space, casinos, hotels, urban residential or similar uses which typically have more intensive land requirements than could be readily accommodated in other areas of downtown. To support these objectives, building heights in this area are permitted to be higher than in other character areas within downtown, provided appropriate transitions are provided to the more modest scale of development found along Carson Street, the surrounding neighborhoods, and the State Capitol Complex. 
    Neighborhood Transition. The purpose of the neighborhood transition character area is to provide a more gradual transition between the more urban patterns of development desired in other locations within downtown and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. To support this objective, building heights are much more restrictive than in other character areas and are required to "step down" towards the surrounding neighborhood and building design becomes less blocky and urban and more residential in character. Uses in this area will tend to be primarily a mix of office and residential, however, a broad range of uses is permitted provided the design of the uses is compatible with the established character of the area.

6.5 - Permitted uses 
    This section sets forth the uses that are allowed within the DT-MU district and are intended to supplement the permitted and conditional uses listed in Chapter 18.04, Use Districts, Section 18.04.125, Downtown Mixed-Use, and group uses into specific categories for purposes in these development standards. A mix of uses is encouraged within each character area and may be required in some locations, as specified in this section.

6.5.2  Conditional Use Criteria. In addition to the findings listed in Section 18.02.080 of this code, findings from a preponderance of evidence must indicate that the proposed use: 
1.  Is consistent and compatible with the character and intent for the downtown character area in which it is proposed; 
2.  Incorporates or can be incorporated as part of a broader mix of uses to support an active "people-oriented" environment within the downtown character area; and 
3.  Can be integrated into the more urban development pattern in a manner that is consistent with master plan policies for downtown. 
6.5.3  Mix of Uses. 

    The following standards and guidelines shall apply within the urban mixed-use and main street mixed-use character areas only: 
1.  Mix of Uses Encouraged. To provide for a balance of commercial, office, residential, and civic uses as set forth above, new developments are encouraged to include a mix of two or more distinct types of permitted uses. 
2.  Required Mix of Uses-Sites 50,000 Square Feet or Larger. All developments on sites that exceed 50,000 square feet (roughly 2 blocks) shall include at least one use from the commercial/service/retail use group, as identified in the table above. 
3.  Ground Floor Uses. The incorporation of retail shops and/or restaurants is encouraged at the street level to promote a more active environment for pedestrians and to support residential and office uses located within the same building (on upper floors) or nearby. This configuration of uses is particularly encouraged along Carson Street and other major street frontages, as well as adjacent to major public spaces, where a high level of activity and visibility is desirable. If a limited portion of a structure's ground level will be devoted to retail or restaurant space, such space should be located along those facades adjacent to or most visible from primary street frontages or major pedestrian walkways. 
4.  Parking Structures. Parking structures shall be "wrapped" with retail, office, or residential uses along a minimum of 50 percent of their street frontage to provide visual interest and to create pedestrian activity at the street level. Active uses, such as retail shops and/or restaurants, should be focused along those facades adjacent to or most visible from primary street frontages or major pedestrian walkways. Parking structures as a primary site use are only permitted by special use permit.

6.6.11  Guidelines for the Renovation and Restoration of Existing Structures. 
1.  Intent. 
a.  To promote the preservation of existing downtown buildings that have historic characteristics, although they are not included as part of the historic district. 
b.  To promote and establish appropriate procedures for the cleaning, renovation, and restoration of original downtown storefronts that have been substantially altered and obscured during previous remodeling efforts. 
2.  Inappropriate Alterations. 
a.  Remodeling with unauthentic false historical details, trims, and moldings creates a confusing historical context for the community and should be avoided. 
b.  The use of light gauge metal, steel panels, or other materials to make two or more storefronts appear to be a single, larger structure should be avoided. If panels are already in place, upper story windows, storefronts, doors, cornices, and other trim materials which were removed to accommodate the panels should be researched and replaced during the rehabilitation process. 
c.  Upper story doors and windows and street-level storefronts that have been previously covered, sealed, or filled in should be restored to their original proportions and appearance during the rehabilitation process. 
d.  Transom windows which were covered over when suspended acoustical tiled ceilings were installed, or for other reasons, should be uncovered during the rehabilitation process. 

3.  Cleaning. 
a.  Abrasive cleaning techniques such as sandblasting should be avoided on the exterior of downtown buildings. Such cleaning methods cut into the building's materials, causing irreversible damage. 
b.  Sandblasted buildings that have not severely deteriorated should be painted to slow the process. Care must be taken to avoid varnishes, enamels, polyurethane sealants and other products impervious to moisture penetration. Sealants will lock moisture inside the masonry and prevent evaporation ultimately causing severe moisture damage. 
c.  As an alternative to abrasive cleaning techniques, the following techniques should be considered: 
(1)  A gentle water wash in combination with a natural bristle brush used to gently scrub the surface of the building. If necessary, a mild detergent can be used, but must be thoroughly rinsed. 
(a)  For heavy grime or layers of paint, a chemical cleaner may be necessary. Alkaline or acidic cleaners are available; however, chemical cleaning should always be done by experienced professionals. 
(b)  A steam cleaning process may also be appropriate for certain building materials. 
d.  Whether water, steam, or chemical cleaner is used, always clean a test patch area first to judge the reaction, or consult a professional in the field. A list of local professionals is available at the planning division. 
e.  All debris and cleaning materials should be contained on site and not allowed to flow into the storm drain system. 
4.  Repair, Removal, and Replacement. 
a.  Removal of materials or structures including oversized signs, windows or door coverings, or metal slipcovers should not take place until the following steps are followed: 
(1)  Inventory and photograph or draw accurate elevations of the elements to be removed; 
(2)  Examine each element and determine how it is attached and anchored to the building. If possible, remove a small portion of a slipcover to determine how the rest is anchored; 
(3)  Create a plan for repair of original material that was damaged when alterations were made; drilled holes for anchor bolts, lost or damaged decorative elements, accumulated dirt and rust stains are the most common types of damage. 
b.  If a decorative element such as a cornice or trim around a window was removed or altered to accommodate earlier renovation efforts, it may require replication by a skilled artisan or replacement with a simpler element. Catalogs of companies that specialize in replicating historic building architectural details are available from the planning division. 
c.  If the original element is lost and no photo documentation is present, it is recommended that the element be substituted with a more conservative design element. 
d.  Materials used to renovate existing buildings should be of a texture, scale, and color that are compatible with the original primary building material. Replacement parts should be selected so as to blend in with existing ones; rather than calling attention to themselves. 
e.  Native stone and masonry should be retained on existing buildings when possible. 
f.  Missing or damaged architectural features that are to be replaced should blend with the building fabric and duplicate the old or match it as closely as possible. However, these new materials should not be antiqued or made to look old when they are not. 
g.  Retention of original historic building elements is encouraged over replacement. When replacement is required, attention should be given to matching the building's original window treatment as closely as possible.

Division 7 - HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT 
Sections: 

7.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this section is to provide standards and requirements for new and expanded development on hills and slopes, as defined in this section, in such a manner that the public health, safety, welfare, and resources of Carson City are protected. The standards and requirements of this section are designed to minimize the potential of hillside development that could cause or contribute to landslides, erosion, sedimentation, deforestation, flooding and/or the aesthetic degradation of the city's natural environment. This section is to be used in conjunction with the provisions of Appendix J, Chapter 18, of the Building Code as currently adopted by Carson City and Section 18.08 (Hillside Development) of the Carson City Municipal Code (CCMC). Where there are no minimum requirements or standards prescribed by this section, the existing provisions of Title 17 (Subdivisions) Title 18 (Zoning Ordinance) or the development standards shall dictate the standards and practices to be followed. This division is administered by development engineering services. 
(Ord. 2006-4 § 5 (part), 2006: Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
7.2 - Applicability. 
7.2.1  Any parcels or development sites exhibiting an average 15% slope or more are subject to the standards and requirements of this section. 
7.2.2  The following formula shall be used to determine average slope for hillside standards: S = I ÷ D x 100; where S is average slope; where I is the difference between the highest and lowest contour lines of a topographical map for the parcel, in feet; and D is the distance between the contour lines used in computing I, in feet; and 100 is the conversion factor into percentage. The average slope of a parcel is measured along a line located near the center of any area to be used for development. 
7.2.3  "D" must be perpendicular to the height contours.

Division 8 - PARK STANDARDS 
Sections: 

8.1 - Purpose. 
    The following park standards have been prepared to provide quality design and long term maintenance of public park areas within the city. The standards are to insure that facilities are planned and designed within parameters which are safe, are of a lasting quality, creates an enjoyable environment, and provides for ease of maintenance. 
    The Carson City parks and recreation master plan element provides policy direction for providing park facilities within the community, and defines the types of facilities (standards) as mini-park, linear park/trails, neighborhood park, community park, special use park, and conservancy area. 
    As new development occurs within the community, the current residential construction tax generates revenue for installation of facilities within existing parks or in some instances new parks. In order for new park facilities to be added within the city, the recreational purpose of the facility must serve a broad spectrum of users within the city or neighborhood.

c.  Lighting for evening walking and security are an essential consideration. 
d.  Walkway adjacent to roadways should be separated from road by a minimum 5 feet wide planting zone. 
e.  Turf area should be minimized; other living groundcover preferred. 
f.  Curb ramps along the primary travel path shall have a standard 5 feet bottom width. Curb ramps and sidewalk shall be arranged to provide for auto/pedestrian safety and visibility at intersections/crossings. 
g.  Curb ramps shall use 1 removable bollard (minimum 4 feet on center, maximum 5 feet on center) to inhibit vehicle access, when appropriate. 
(Ord. 2006-4 § 5 (part), 2006; Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
8.5 - Park plan development process. 
    The typical design process for a park shall follow the sequence outlined below: 
8.5.1  Program Development. This element establishes goals and objectives for development of the park facility. Who are the users, how will the facility be integrated with the recreation activities anticipated, what is the expected user experience, what is the budget, etc. This element is developed in consultation with park staff. 
8.5.2  Site Analysis. This element starts with inventory of on-site and off-site factors, including both man-made elements and natural resources. Man-made elements include legal and physical boundary improvements such as buildings, roads and utilities, land uses, etc. Natural resources include topography, soil and geologic conditions, water, vegetation, wildlife, etc. Natural forces include temperature, sand, wind, precipitation, etc. Perceptual characteristics include views, smells, spatial patterns, general impressions, etc. Seek to identify the special nature of the site; this is also known as the opportunities and constraints phase. 
8.5.3  Conceptual Diagrams. This element starts by grouping program items into logical associations so that their interdependence can be understood. This element is generally referred to as the "bubble diagram" stage. It concentrates on functional relationships and lines of travel without regard to scale or detailed site information. Next, opportunities and constraints of the site are factored in so that uses can be located where they make the most sense. 
8.5.4  Review. After development of the site analysis and conceptual diagrams, review by the park staff must be accomplished by the city prior to schematic design. 
8.5.5  Schematic Design. Once program relationships and on-site and off-site factors are understood, the diagram is translated into a loosely-scaled sketch. The bubble diagrams should be viewed as just guidelines that can be freely manipulated to accommodate a great idea. This is the stage where ideas flow freely in design charettes; all factors will be reacted to simultaneously as the concepts take shape. It is important to develop several alternative designs for staff review. 
8.5.6  Review. Presentation to the park and recreation commission for approval is held at this juncture to insure city input has been incorporated and selection in final design solution for the park facility. 
8.5.7  Design Development. Also referred to as the master plan, this phase is characterized by a carefully rendered plan of the selected alternative, usually accompanied by character sketches, elevations and blow-up plans of key areas. It is important to have all elements scaled carefully at this phase so that there will be no surprises after the plans are reviewed and approved by the city. Usually there is an emphasis on graphic impact as the plans will be used for agency presentations and/or public display. A key component of this stage is a detailed cost estimate; this will be reviewed carefully by the city and will impact what facilities can be included in the park. 
8.5.8  Review and Approval. The parks and recreation commission and the board will review the plans for final approval. 
8.5.9  Construction Documents. These are the detailed plans and specifications for the park construction and will include various professional disciplines for a design such as the landscape architect, civil engineer, architect, and electrical engineer. These plans must be completed in the manner described in the landscape standards section of the appendix of this document. Park staff will review and approve the final construction documents before submitting to the Carson City building department for a city building permit. 
8.5.10  Bidding and Construction. Depending on the type of facility, project budget and scope of work, the city will put the project out for formal competitive bids following the procedures required by the city. 
8.5.11  Project Close Out. At the completion of the project, the city will require all construction documents to be provided to the city in electronic and hard copy format. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
8.6 - Standard park components. 
    To allow for efficiency in maintenance and repair, materials inventory, training of personnel, and recognizing the need of consistently attractive and durable products, certain park facility products, materials, and elements are standard components of park facility products, materials, and elements. Contact the parks and recreation department for the required standard components for park facility products, materials and elements regarding any future park construction projects. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
Division 9 - TRAIL STANDARDS 
Sections: 

Design guidelines. 
    The following guidelines are set forth to implement Carson City's trail standards. (References: Carson City parks and recreation master plan element, Carson City transportation plan-bicycle element, Carson River master plan and Carson City Eagle Valley trail system.) 
    For additional details about horizontal alignment, sight distances, signing and marking, drainage, intersections, pavement structure, and grade-separation structures for paved bicycle paths refer to the Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities prepared by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Task Force on Geometric Design. 
    Similarly, for trails on federal lands, refer to the trail construction guidelines of the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. 
    Generally speaking, Carson City trails are intended to be designed for multi-use and available for all types of general public users. These trails will be nonmotorized, except for city maintenance vehicles, and provide off-road routes of travel that serve both recreational and transportation functions. Most trails are intended for only day-use passive recreational activities. 
9.1 - Trails. 
9.1.1  Trail Design. Figures 1 through 6 illustrate the design characteristics for Carson City's trail standards within the Eagle Valley trail system, Carson River master plan, and the regional transportation plan-bicycle element. Refer to these documents to determine which trail design is applicable to a particular trail segment. 
9.1.2  Trails and Land Use Compatibility. Trails will be located along property lines where feasible or located in conjunction with the use of the lands as identified in any new proposals for land use changes. 
    Trails not within planned road rights-of-way should be set back from occupied dwellings a minimum distance in accordance with Table A. Where setbacks specified in Table A are not feasible, potential noise and privacy impacts must be evaluated and reduced by use of berms, fencing, landscaping and other feasible and compatible means, if necessary. 
Table A 
Trail Setback Guidelines 
Land Use Category* Trail Setback Guidelines from Occupied Dwelling (HDR) High Density Residential 25 feet (MDR) Medium Density Residential 25 feet (LDR) Low Density Residential 50 feet (SR) Suburban Residential 100 feet (RR) Rural Residential 100 feet (AR) Agricultural/Residential 300 feet (OSR) Open Space/ Recreational/ Rural Residential 300 feet  
* As defined by the land use element of the Carson City master plan. 
    In areas where trail routes are adjacent to private property, fencing should be used if requested by the adjacent property owner to deter users from leaving the trail. Several types of fencing could be used; for example, 4-smooth strand wire, a wire mesh fence with wood corner posts/metal tee posts, split rail wood fence or chain link fence and should be of a uniform nature for any given trail segment. Fencing should be selected in cooperation with the adjacent property owner(s). 
9.1.3  Road Crossings. At-grade road crossings must be designed to equally consider vehicular and trail user safety (reference: Figure 7). Road crossings should be designed at road intersections and are preferred at these locations for safety reasons. lf design constraints require a mid-block road crossing, a center refuge island with crosswalk striping should be considered to minimize pedestrian/vehicle conflicts and user safety. 
9.1.4  Sight Distance. Clearing widths of shared-use trails involving bicycles and pedestrians should be designed to meet AASHTO standards to assure proper sight distance where possible. If sight distances on curves, around hills or through densely vegetated areas are less than one hundred feet (100'), safety signs and reduced speed limits should be considered. At the intersections of shared-use trails or where off-road bicycle trails intersect with on-road bicycle routes not at road intersections, there should ideally be a fifteen foot (15') turning radius and twenty-five foot (25') sight clearance between the two (2) trail routes. 
9.1.5  Trail Under Crossings. Where a trail must pass under a highway bridge, sufficient vertical clear-space and security lighting should be provided to accommodate trail use. Where practical, the design should provide an optimum horizontal dimensions as called for by AASHTO standards. Where the provision of such spaces is not possible, alternative pavement textures should be provided and safety signs placed on either side of the under crossing involved to inform trail users of such conditions and the procedures to follow, such as reducing speeds or dismounting. 
9.1.6  Trail Structures. 
9.1.6.1  Drainage Crossings. Trails crossing creeks and drainages may require a culvert. Culverts in water courses or drainages must be carefully placed to minimize disturbance. Erosion control measures must be taken to prevent erosion at the outfalls of drainage structures. The fill over culverts should match the trail and shoulder width. 
9.1.6.2  Trail Bridges. Bridges should be a minimum of five feet (5') wide on single-track trails and a minimum of eight feet (8') wide on a natural-surfaced shared-use trail. Bridges for paved shared-use trails should be a minimum of ten feet (10') wide and structurally capable of carrying maintenance vehicles, if required. All bridges must have minimum forty-two inch (42?) high railings when necessary. Bridge footings should be constructed outside of the stream's top of bank. 
9.1.7  Access and Safety Barriers. (Reference: Figures 7 and 8) 
    Bollards, boulders, logs, stiles, and/or other structures should be used to prevent motorized vehicles of the public from entering trail routes at any crossing of a public road right-of-way or at any trail staging area. 
    Safety barriers, grade separations, and/or barrier plantings should be provided to protect trail routes along heavily traveled roads. 
    Gates installed for trail users should be a minimum of three feet (3') in width and able to be self-closing. Vehicle gates, where necessary, should be a minimum of ten feet (10') in width, lockable and signed for no parking to prevent blockage for emergency access. 
9.1.8  Signs. Six (6) types of signs should be used to manage uses along each trail. These signs include: 
    Identity signs will indicate through a common logo that the trail is part of Carson City's Eagle Valley Trail System, identify the specific trail name, and provide a space for recognition of trail ownership or joint agency management. Identity signs will be located at all staging areas, at trail intersections, and at intersections with roads (Reference Figure 8). 
    Trail route markers will indicate through a common logo, trail name sponsor, and mileages. Trail route markers will be located every one-quarter (1/4) mile along the trail or at significant directional changes in the trial. (Reference Figure 8). 
    Trail use signs will be located at all staging areas, at trail intersections, at intersections with roads and portray the following information (Reference Figure 8): 
    Which types of trail use are appropriate, permitted, or prohibited on the trail; 
    Distance to staging areas or intersections with other trails; 
    Other points of interest along the trail route; and 
    Accessibility conditions and other Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) related information. 
    General use signs will be placed at each trail staging area and portray the following information: 
    Educating trail users about respecting private property along the trail route and/or any special land use considerations; 
    Restricting trail user parking on local streets; and 
    Restricting smoking and/or use of matches or lighters during high fire season. 
    Safety signs will be located on an as-needed basis along the trails and at staging areas and portray the following information: 
    Displaying warnings of upcoming underpasses, street intersections, blind curves, vertical clearances; 
    Providing information about water availability; 
    Advising trail users of the need to reduce speed or dismount and walk their bicycles or horses; 
    Warning of mountain lion or other wildlife danger; 
    Identifying any use restrictions during the fire season; and explaining the hierarchy of yielding among trail users. 
    Private property signs posted at regular intervals in conformance with legal requirements to remind the trail user not to trespass. 
9.1.9  Benches. Benches for resting should be provided at regular intervals within one-half (1/2) mile of staging areas and along trail routes. Benches should be located at places with aesthetic qualities, viewpoints, and particularly at the end of any long uphill stretches. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
9.2 - Community staging areas. 
    Community staging areas are intended to serve the entire Carson City community. 
9.2.1  Location. It is preferable to locate community staging areas within designated parks and recreation areas or at other community facilities so that management responsibilities may be shared. In any event, staging areas should be located only where there is adequate management capability. Staging areas should be designed to adequately accommodate and manage anticipated use levels to prevent overflow parking onto local neighborhood streets. Ideally, staging areas should be located on or near a public transit route. 
9.2.2  Facilities. Community staging areas should contain, at a minimum, adequate parking, potable water supply, sanitary facilities, and emergency telephones and access. The city should consider a range of other facilities appropriate to the trail uses that the community staging areas serve. These facilities might include: other general parking; identity, use, and safety signs; trail map dispensers; and public telephones. Where equestrian staging is provided, facilities could include: horse trailer parking; watering troughs; hitching rails; and loading platforms designed to accommodate ADA guidelines. Gates or removable bollards should be included at the street entrance to all community staging areas. Portable water for trail users and domestic animals permitted on the trail should be provided at staging areas, where practical. Trail routes where no potable water is available will be posted at staging areas with safety signs indicating such conditions. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
9.3 - Neighborhood access points. 
    Neighborhood access points are not typically located on arterial or collector streets. They should provide limited parking and offer the opportunity for local residents to conveniently access trails. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
9.4 - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
    Where feasible, the design of the trail system should recognize the intent of the ADA and should be made accessible to everyone. Based on topographic slope conditions, three (3) accessibility zones within the city are identified in the Eagle Valley trail system plan. These are: easy, moderate to difficult, and primitive. The Eagle Valley trail system plan defines the general characteristics of each zone. The final definition of each zone and ADA accessibility, as it pertains to a particular trail segment, should be made only after detailed site investigations has been conducted. Table B summarizes the preferred design criteria based on accessibility within these zones. All trail routes within the easy level of access should be designed to meet guidelines presented in Table C. Trails within moderate to difficult and primitive levels of access should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

(Ord. 2006-4 § 5 (part), 2006; Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
Division 11 - HEALTH 
Sections: 

11.1 - Environmental Health Department requirements. 
    The Environmental Health Department (EHD) regulates a number of areas related to development which includes: 
Septic System Design; 
Pretreatment Program; 
Industrial Waste Disposal Program; 
Solid Waste Management Program; 
Medical Waste Program. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
11.2 - Septic system design. 
11.2.1  See Nevada Administrative Code (NAC), sections 444.750 through 444.8396, inclusive. 
11.2.2  The applicant shall submit plans to the building department for distribution to the EHD. Prior to the issuance of a septic permit, the applicant shall meet all applicable state and city regulations. Applicant shall contact the environmental health department. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
11.3 - Industrial waste disposal program. 
    The major focus of this program is to protect groundwater resources, landfill personnel, and the public by ensuring that no hazardous wastes are disposed at the landfill. Many industries generate a non-reusable by-product that must be discarded. This type of waste is often suitable for landfill disposal, however, a change in raw materials or processing techniques can render a hazardous waste. Due to this fact, the EHD inspects and samples all potential sources of hazardous waste to determine if the waste is acceptable for disposal. If the waste is not hazardous, a manifest is issued to the industry allowing transport to the landfill. The manifest system provides a tracking mechanism allowing a full accounting of industrial wastes accepted at the landfill. If a hazardous waste is found, the EHD coordinates with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) to ensure that is it properly transported and disposed at a certified hazardous waste disposal site. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
11.4 - Solid waste management program. 
    Carson City owns the landfill located east of the city. The Carson City sanitary landfill accepts municipal solid waste and construction/demolition waste. Hazardous wastes are strictly prohibited. The EHD tracks all asbestos-related building demolitions and renovations from the time of building permit application to the ultimate disposal of the asbestos. This is done to ensure that all asbestos abatement is performed in accordance with the federal regulations regarding removal, transportation, and disposal. This protects the asbestos workers and the public from the health risks of asbestos exposure. All asbestos is segregated from other municipal solid waste and immediately buried in an area which is surveyed in order to maintain a permanent record of its location. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
11.5 - Medical waste program. 
    Since 1993, the EHD has enforced a "medical waste program." Enforcement authority for this program is provided for in CCMC 12.12. All facilities in Carson City that generate a potentially infectious waste are required to properly containerize this waste in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. This waste must not be co-mingled with normal refuse. The infectious waste is manifested, then transported separately to the landfill for immediate burial. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
Division 12 - TRANSPORTATION 
Sections: 
STREETS AND TRAFFIC 

12.1 - General. 
    All streets will be improved and conform to the requirements of this division. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.2 - Standards. 
    Design and construction of streets and related improvements will conform to the most recent edition of the following: 
1.  "Guidelines for Urban Major Street Design," by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
2.  "A Policy on Geometric Designs of Highways and Streets," by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
3.  "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices," by the Federal Highway Administration. 
4.  "Guide for Development of New Bicycle Facilities," by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. 
5.  "Standard Details & Specifications for Public Works Construction," by Regional Transportation, Commission of Washoe County, Washoe County, City of Sparks, City of Reno, Carson City, City of Yerington as modified and adopted by Carson City. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.3 - Street widths and alignment. 
    Street alignments will conform to the Carson City master plan. Additional right-of-way will be provided near intersections as required by the city in order to facilitate turning movements. 
    Streets with centerline offsets at intersections of less than one hundred twenty-five feet (125') are not allowed. All improvements will be centered within the dedicated right-of-way or dedicated street easement. 
    Adjustments to the street widths, curb return radii, and other traffic calming techniques will be considered when pedestrian and bicycle safety and convenience are important. Traffic calming techniques will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the city. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.4 - Access. 
    At least two (2) means of ingress and egress to city standards will be provided to serve a subdivision or development, with the exception of a single cul-de-sac subdivision. A single cul-de-sac subdivision may be approved with only one (1) means of access and egress. An emergency access easement or fire access easement is not a secondary means of access and cannot be used to waive or modify the requirements of this section unless approved by the city engineer. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.5 - Off-site improvements. 
    Streets or access adjacent to or necessary to serve a development which are not within the boundaries of the development, but are dedicated public right-of-ways, will be improved with development to standards promoting public access, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.6 - Right-of-way and easements. 
    All necessary right-of-way or easement acquisition outside the boundaries of a subdivision or development, including agreements as to access, ownership and maintenance, will be completed at the time of submittal of application for a development permit. Right-of-way widths will not be less than shown in Table 12.1. 
    In areas of possible fire hazards, at the urban interface, unobstructed fire protection equipment access easements not less than twenty feet (20') wide will be dedicated from the public street to the subdivision or development boundary as determined by the fire chief. Permanent emergency access will be designed and constructed to comply with the requirements of Section 12.12.13 Emergency Access Streets. 
Table 12.1 
Minimum Right-of-Way Widths 
Functional Classification Minimum Right-of-Way Width (feet) Arterial 80 Collector 60 Industrial Street 60 Local Street 50  
    Note: All existing principal arterial roadways in Carson City are maintained under the jurisdiction of the Nevada Department of Transportation. Right-of-way for principal arterials will be coordinated with the Nevada Department of Transportation and comply with their requirements. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.7 - Streets along property boundaries. 
    Streets must not be located along property boundaries unless required by a city adopted street plan. A proposed access street lying along a boundary, which is within the development or off-site but within an easement already dedicated to the city, must be dedicated and constructed to city standards. A proposed street lying along the boundary of a development or subdivision, which is within the development or is off-site within an easement dedicated to the city, that is impacted by that subdivision or development, must be dedicated and constructed by that subdivision or development. If the proposed street, which is in the development or subdivision, does not offset any of the traffic of the development but is shown on the master plan or city adopted street pattern, the street must be dedicated. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.8 - Half streets. 
    Half streets are permitted. The minimum street section permitted will be twenty-six feet (26') in width. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.9 - Temporary cul-de-sac and dead end streets. 
    Streets will be extended to the subdivision/development boundary for future development. Where subdivisions are phased, streets will be extended to the subdivision phase boundary line. Streets extending to the subdivision or development boundary which are proposed for future extension and exceed two hundred feet (200') in length are to be provided with temporary cul-de-sacs. The future removal of the cul-de-sac and its replacement to city standard street improvements will be provided with the extension of the street by future development. Right-of-ways or easements will be provided by the developer for the temporary cul-de-sac. For streets less than two hundred feet (200') in length a barricade will be placed at the end of the street. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.10 - Pavement sections. 
    Pavement sections will be based on subgrade strength values determined by resistance (R) value or California bearing ratio (CBR) as shown in the soils engineering report. Refer to division 17, soils engineering reports, for requirements for the soils report. As a minimum, pavement sections will conform to the requirements of this division. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
12.11 - Design requirements. 
    Streets will be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this division and the requirements of the Carson City code. 
12.11.1  Street Grades. All streets will have a minimum longitudinal grade of four-tenths percent (0.4%). Arterial streets may have a maximum allowable grade of six percent (6%). Collectors and industrial streets will have a maximum grade of six percent (6%). Local streets may have a maximum allowable grade of ten percent (10%). The following criteria will also apply to street grades: 
1.  Grades in excess of eight percent (8%) will be limited to a horizontal tangent length of four hundred feet (400'). Grades in excess of ten percent (10%) will be limited to critical design issues and will receive specific approval from the city engineer. 
2.  Street intersections will not be allowed when the grade on the primary street exceeds six percent (6%). 
3.  "Roller-coaster" and "hidden-dip" patterns are not allowed. 
4.  Sharp horizontal curvature will not be introduced at or near the top of a pronounced crest vertical curve or near the bottom of a pronounced sag vertical curve. 
12.11.2  Street Intersections. Street grades on the minor legs of intersections will not exceed four percent (4%) for a minimum distance of fifty feet (50') measured from the extension of the face of curb or edge of pavement of the primary street from the intersection (improved to full city standards). Additional criteria are as follows: 
1.  Street intersections of two (2) local streets with a stop condition at all corners do not require a vertical curve at the intersection of the crown section with the street grade. 
2.  Other street intersections will require a vertical transition at the intersection of the crown section with the street grade. 
3.  Whenever a street or highway is proposed requiring a separation of grades or special form of intersection design, the improvements will be designed to provide for the intersection design, and all lots or building sites will be practical and conform to the requirements for grading plans. 
4.  Intersection sight distance (a clear vision triangle) will be maintained at each corner created by the intersection of two (2) streets, or the intersection of a driveway with a street. When designing a new project, the engineer will ensure that no embankments, hills, buildings, fences, walls, signs, foliage, or other visual obstructions encroach higher than three feet (3'), or lower than eight feet (8') into the clear vision triangle as measured from the top of curb, or as measured from the edge of pavement where no curb exists. If there are sight distance restrictions, the engineer will mitigate these restrictions by reconfiguring the roadway geometrics, moving the proposed intersection location, or eliminating the obstruction. The owner will also provide for protection of the clear vision triangle from future obstacles by creating corner easements or dedicating additional corner right-of-way. The clear vision triangle area is defined in Table 12.2. 
5.  Objects narrower than four inches (4?) in diameter, such as sign posts, are exempt from the clear vision area requirements. Where there are existing topographical features, buildings, or other fixed objects that cannot be removed to meet the minimum intersection sight distance requirements shown in Table 12.2, the city may allow the minimum stopping sight distance requirements shown in Table 12.3 to control as an absolute minimum provided there are no other intersection locations where greater sight distance can be obtained.

2. Measured along the center of the approaching travel lanes, as observed from a point twelve (12) feet back from the edge of traveled way, and measured from an eye height of three and one-half (3.5) feet to an approaching object height of four and one-quarter (4.25) feet. 
12.11.3  Street Crown. The normal street crown will be two percent (2%) from the centerline to the lip of gutter, with a minimum of one percent (1%) and a maximum of four percent (4%). The crown will be at the centerline of the traveled way. The street asphalt concrete contact with the lip of the concrete gutter will be three-eighths ( 3/8 ) inches higher than the elevation of the lip of the gutter unless incorporated as part of a bike lane. 
12.11.4  Vertical Curves. Vertical curves will be provided wherever the algebraic difference between two (2) intersecting grades is two percent (2%) or more, excluding intersections. Vertical curves will be of sufficient length to provide the minimum sight and stopping distances as established by AASHTO. 
12.11.5  Horizontal Curves. Horizontal curve radii, sight distances, maximum allowable side friction, and maximum allowable superelevation will be determined in accordance with the requirements of "A Policy on Geometric Designs of Highways and Streets," by AASHTO and Tables 12.4 and 12.5. In no case will the centerline curve radius be less than one hundred fifty feet (150').

Notes: Superelevation not allowed in urban areas. See section 12.12.5. 
12.11.6  Broken-Back Curves. Broken-back curves (having a short tangent between two (2) curves in the same direction) will not be allowed. A compound curve alignment will be used to eliminate the need for a short tangent section between curves. Design of compound curves will comply with "A Policy on Geometric Designs of Highways and Streets," by AASHTO. 
12.11.7  Median Openings. The design of median openings will be subject to the requirements and approval of the city including storage lengths and tapers to AASHTO requirements. 
12.11.8  Intersection Angles. A street or highway intersecting with another street or highway, will intersect as near to a ninety (90) degree angle as is practicable, but in no event will an intersection be allowed at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees. 
12.11.9  Private Streets. Private streets will be designed to meet city standards for local streets, including street lights, storm drain systems, water systems, sanitary sewer systems, and paving structural section. 
12.11.10  Asphalt Concrete Structural Sections. Design of the structural section for asphalt concrete pavement will conform to the Asphalt Institute Manual Series No. 1 (MS-1) or an alternate approved by the city engineer. Inputs to the design procedure will be developed in accordance with the following: 
1.  Streetbed Soil. Streetbed soil testing will be performed to determine the design streetbed soil resilient modulus, M r , for use in the design charts, where existing soils data does not exist. The design streetbed soil resilient modulus, M r , will be determined from test results from the resistance (R) value or California bearing ratio (CBR) tests. Correlations between resilient modulus, M r , and the resistance (R) value or California bearing ratio (CBR) will be in accordance with the AASHTO "Guide for Design of Pavement Structures." Sufficient tests will be made to evaluate each different soil type in the project. If significant streetbed soil variation is present, sufficient tests will be made to determine the controlling (weakest) soil type, or the limits and boundaries of each streetbed soil type. The design streetbed soils resilient modulus, M r , will be based on the results of R value or CBR tests, and will be determined as a function of the design traffic level, using lower design values when higher traffic levels exist. Percentile design values (select the design modulus such that X percent of all test values are less than the design modulus) for various traffic levels will not be less than the following: 
Design Traffic Level Cumulative ESAL's Over the Design Period Minimum Percentile Design Value (X) <10,000 60 10,000 to 1,000,000 75 >1,000,000 87.5  
2.  Traffic. Site specific traffic data or projections will be used to determine the number of equivalent eighteen thousand (18,000) pound equivalent single axle load (ESAL) applications for the design period. The vehicle types and volumes will be based on the results of a traffic study and will include construction vehicles that will traffic the street during construction of the development or project. ESAL factors will be selected from the Asphalt Institute MS-1 or the AASHTO "Guide for Design of Pavement Structures" for a terminal serviceability index of 2.0. An annual growth rate of not less than four percent (4%) will be used for the design period unless the street is a cul-de-sac or is within a closed service area with no potential for future growth. Design period will be twenty (20) years. 
    The worksheet for calculating eighteen thousand (18,000) pound ESAL's and the traffic growth rates shown in Tables 12.6 and 12.7 respectively, will be used to determine the design ESAL applications. If the calculated design ESAL based on site specific data or projections is less than five thousand (5,000), a design ESAL of five thousand (5,000) will be used. Generic traffic estimates or guidelines for estimating ESAL's based on street classification will not be used. 
    Site specific traffic data or projections are not required for local streets that serve less than ten (10) residential units. These streets may be designed using a design ESAL of not less than five thousand (5,000). 
3.  Thickness Design. Thickness design of asphalt concrete pavements will be based on the Asphalt Institute MS-1 or approved alternative. In no case will the structural section for asphalt concrete pavements be less than that shown in Table 12.8. 
4.  Material Determination. Asphalt concrete pavement mix will be Type 2 or Type 3 as shown in Table 12.8 in conformance with the "Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction." 
12.11.11  Cul-De-Sacs and Knuckles. Minimum grades around cul-de-sacs and knuckle-type intersections will be one-half percent (0.5%). The normal street crown with such a development may be increased to a maximum of four percent (4%) from the centerline to the lip of gutter. 
12.11.12  Temporary Cul-De-Sacs. Temporary cul-de-sacs will be constructed with a minimum of six inches (6?) of aggregate base located within the development. When located within an adjacent future developable area it will conform to temporary emergency access street standards within an access easement. 
    The minimum radius of the turnaround will be forty-five feet (45') when measured from the radius point to face of curb or edge of pavement where no curb is present. 
12.11.13  Emergency Access Streets. Permanent and temporary emergency access streets will have a minimum surface width of twenty feet (20'). Grades will not exceed the maximum street grades. Access to street at each entrance will be controlled by an "Emergency Access Control Gate," and will be posted "For Emergency Access Only."

Notes: 
1. Factor = [(1 + g)n - 1]/g, where g = rate/100 and is not zero. If annual growth rate is zero, the growth factor is equal to the analysis period. 
2. The above growth factors multiplied by the first year traffic estimate will give the total volume of traffic expected during the analysis period.

12.12 - Sidewalks, curb and gutter, driveway approaches, curb-cuts, alleys and bikeways. 
12.12.1  Sidewalks. In no instance will sidewalks be less than five feet (5') in width (not including curb and gutter). In areas where handrails encroach upon the sidewalk, the sidewalk will be widened to provide a minimum five foot (5') clear width. 
12.12.2  Residential Driveway Access. Driveway access will be allowed in accordance with Table 12.11. Design and construction for driveway approaches and curb-cuts will be in accordance with city standards. All residential driveway approaches will enter properties via a standard curb-out. No curb returns are permitted for residential approaches or access. Driveway grades will not exceed fourteen percent (14%). Driveway alignment must be safe and convenient to back a car out, or an adequate turn-around will be provided. Residential driveways will have a minimum width of twelve feet (12') and a maximum width of twenty-seven feet (27'). Driveway width will be measured at the back of walk. Driveways will be constructed of Portland cement concrete in urban areas, and Portland cement concrete or asphalt concrete in rural areas. Alternative materials must be approved by the city.

12.13 - Traffic and impact study requirements. 
12.13.1  General. Traffic engineering and impact studies are required for the purpose of analyzing the impacts of development or improvement on the existing transportation system. The transportation system is composed of primarily surfaced streets, but also includes elements such as pedestrian paths, bike paths and lanes, bus routes, highways or other means of transportation. Traffic engineering studies shall be prepared and submitted to the city to identify and mitigate traffic impacts of development activity. All traffic studies for proposed development on now vacant land shall be prepared based on Carson City master plan land uses and densities. 
    Traffic engineering studies shall be presented in written format, accompanied by appropriate drawings, plans, or maps needed to clearly present the material. The study shall clearly list all assumptions and criteria upon which the analysis is based. All references shall be listed by author, publications, name and date. Traffic engineering studies are required if one or more of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The proposed development shall generate eighty (80) or more peak hour trips as determined using the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates or other such sources accepted by the city engineer. 
2.  The proposed development shall generate five hundred (500) or more trips per day. 
3.  The proposed development contains phasing, and impacts from the cumulative phasing have net effects of items 1 or 2. In this case, a traffic study shall be required with the first phase of the development. 
4.  The city engineer determines that a traffic study is required. For example, a traffic engineering study may be required for small developments that do not satisfy one of the above requirements if they are near a school, community shopping or recreation area, near a historic area, or shall generate truck traffic. On small developments, the city may require an analysis of the proposed access, safety issues, and the internal street system or parking. 
5.  The proposed development contributes to the need for a traffic signal. 
12.13.2  Scope of Work and Method. The city shall approve the scope of work and method of analysis prior to the start of any traffic engineering study. For all projects a scoping meeting with the city shall be conducted prior to the start of any traffic engineering study. All traffic engineering studies shall be prepared by, or under the direct supervision of, a professional engineer licensed in Nevada with adequate experience in transportation or traffic engineering. The study area shall include all portions of the transportation network that the city or the traffic engineer believe may be affected by the project. The analysis shall include all segments and intersections of the surrounding transportation system. 
12.13.3  Traffic Engineering Study Requirements. In reviewing the scope of work proposed by the consultant for the traffic engineering study, the criteria in the following sections shall be considered by the city: 
12.13.3.1  Previous Traffic Studies. Applications shall include a copy(ies) of previously approved studies applicable to the project or referenced in the new study. If a previously approved traffic engineering study exists for a portion of the study limits, then an analysis of the differences in results shall be included as part of the scope of the current traffic engineering study. Simply referencing previous studies shall not be sufficient. 
12.13.3.2  Master Plan, Zoning and/or Tentative Map Applications. The traffic engineering study shall be based on the Carson City master plan designations, zoning and/or tentative map configurations, at the maximum allowable densities and uses. 
12.13.3.3  Scope of Traffic Engineering Study. A sample table of contents for a traffic engineering study report is shown in Table 12.15. The traffic engineering study shall include the following items as a minimum: 
1.  Project Description. 
a.  Include site plans and location maps. 
b.  Describe and quantify the existing and proposed land uses and zoning, development intensities, and uses of the project site as follows: 
(1)  Existing Conditions: The traffic engineering study shall generate traffic volumes based on the existing land uses and densities based on existing street and transportation configurations. This shall be the basis for further comparison of the proposed project impacts on the existing transportation system. The existing traffic loading shall be based on current traffic counts, either conducted specifically for this study, or as approved by the city. 
(2)  Existing Conditions Plus Project: The traffic engineering study shall generate traffic volumes based on the existing land uses and densities plus the proposed project land uses and densities based on the existing street and transportation configurations. This shall indicate the amount to which the project shall impact the existing transportation system. 
(3)  Long-Term Transportation Model: The traffic engineering study shall generate traffic volumes based on the existing land uses and densities, and city approved projects in the study area. This shall indicate the amount to which this project and all other proposed future projects shall cumulatively impact the existing transportation system. 
c.  Discuss the project phasing and timing of proposed and anticipated future development. 
d.  Submit site plans which shall include the location, separation distance, and number of proposed driveways and intersections. Include all existing and proposed collector, arterial, and expressway facilities through and within three hundred feet (300') of the project. 
e.  Describe the relationship of all access points to the transportation network including separation distance. The descriptions shall include existing driveways and intersections within three hundred feet (300') from the project site, and all intersections within the project site. 
f.  Describe bicycle and pedestrian facilities. 
g.  Discuss existing and proposed public transit service and bus stop improvements. 
h.  Describe all other features that affect traffic flow including crosswalks, school bus stops, and postal cluster boxes. 
2.  Trip Generation. 
a.  Trip generation for average daily trips (ADT), a.m. peak hour trips (including in and out traffic split), and p.m. peak hour trips (including in and out traffic split) shall be based on type and intensity of land use. 
b.  Trip generation shall be based on data published in "Trip Generation," by the ITE. If published data, or local trip generation studies are not available, the engineering firm shall obtain approval from the city for estimated trip rates. 
c.  Indicate how peak periods were identified. 
d.  Provide traffic counts for a typical day; include dates, times, and weather conditions. Traffic counts shall not be more than twelve (12) months old. 
e.  Provide traffic volume maps for all roads and intersections. 
3.  Trip Distribution and Assignment. 
a.  Describe trip distribution for a.m. and p.m. peak periods, noon hour, and existing and future scenarios evaluated in the traffic study. 
b.  Describe the methods used to distribute and assign trips. 
c.  Trip distributions and splits shall be approved by the city. 
4.  Impact Analysis. 
a.  Prepare an impact analysis including effects to level of service (LOS) for the affected roads and intersections for the following time periods for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours: 
(1)  Existing conditions without project. 
(2)  Existing conditions plus project (at project buildout). 
(3)  Carson City master plan build-out plus project. 
b.  For affected intersections, the "critical movement" method of analysis shall be used. An example of this analysis is provided in Figure 5-8 of the "Traffic Engineering Handbook, 4th Edition," (9). 
c.  Pedestrian movements shall be considered in the analysis. 
d.  Roadway operational characteristics and analysis techniques shall be based on the MUTCD by the Federal Highway Administration, "Guidelines for the Design of Streets and Highways" by AASHTO, and the "Highway Capacity Manual" by the Transportation Research Board. 
e.  Analyze the adequacy of storage space for turning vehicles considering signal phasing, signal length, and traffic volumes. 
f.  Analyze the adequacy of site driveways and internal circulation. Driveway design shall be based on the type of traffic that shall use the driveway and adjacent street. Service vehicle access shall be reviewed and based on the size and operating characteristics of service vehicles, particularly turning radii. 
g.  Safety and neighborhood impacts shall be analyzed. Obtain and review traffic accident data for the study area. 
h.  Analyze parking and pertinent site distances. 
i.  Analyze the impact of the project on existing road structures. Analysis shall include: 
(1)  Both the site-generated traffic and the construction traffic associated with the project. 
(2)  An estimate of the total number of equivalent single axle loads (ESALs) generated by the project at completion of the project (including construction traffic), at five (5) years following initiation of construction, and at the year 2015. 
(3)  An estimate for each affected road, of the remaining life (in both ESALs and years) of the road both with (including construction traffic) and without the project. Non-destructive testing, such as falling-weight deflectometer testing, may be required for this analysis. Carson City shall, upon request, provide available information (if any) for this analysis. The traffic report may require a geotechnical engineering supplement to address traffic impacts. 
5.  Impacts and Mitigation. 
a.  A traffic LOS D or better, in the context of providing a safe, efficient and convenient transportation system, shall be maintained through mitigation of impacts from all conditions on all city maintained arterial, and collector roads and at city road intersections, except as noted in the Carson City master plan. The engineering traffic study shall include recommendations for mitigation of project traffic impacts, including timing of improvements, and schematic drawings for recommended mitigation. 
b.  The engineer shall determine the feasibility of constructing the mitigation measures. The feasibility analysis is not to be determined from the standpoint of the single project. In the case of existing or master-planned roads through or adjoining the project, recommended mitigation measures shall include dedication of right-of-way and construction of improvements identified in the transportation element of the Carson City master plan, and adopted transportation improvement plan and five (5) year plans. 
6.  Results. 
a.  The traffic engineering study shall be presented in a neat professionally written form. The language used in the traffic study shall be straightforward, clear and concise. Technical terms and jargon, when used shall be kept to a minimum, and shall be clearly defined. Traffic studies shall include executive summaries at the beginning of the report, and technical appendices at the end of the report. 
b.  The engineering traffic study shall further contain the following information: 
(1)  Basic Discussion: The traffic engineering study shall be prepared so that minimal reference to other sources of information is required to understand the study results. Tables and figures shall be used where necessary to clearly list and itemize numbers and details of the study assumptions and results. 
(2)  Existing Streets and Intersections: The impacts on the existing transportation system, without the proposed improvements shall be clearly explained. This shall be the basis for comparison of the developed conditions. It shall also provide a check against other sources of information such as the transportation element of the Carson City master plan, provide recommendations, based on this analysis of the required improvements needed to meet the Carson City master plan and LOS requirements for traffic capacity at all conditions. 
(3)  New Streets and Intersections: The traffic engineering study shall clearly justify the proposed transportation system improvements and show how they meet the Carson City master plan criteria and policies. Additional improvements required to meet the Carson City master plan criteria and policies, not indicated in the original project assumptions and proposal shall be clearly detailed. The financial responsibility for all proposed improvements shall also be clearly detailed. Compare the results of this analysis with the capabilities of the proposed Carson City master plan build-out improvements.

12.14 - Street lighting. 
    Street lights are required for all developed areas of Carson City. Lighting levels shall be consistent with the appropriate use. Street lights are required to facilitate safe passage of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular traffic, and to provide for security. Street light applications are based on recommendations from the Lighting Handbook "Illuminating Engineering Society of North America" (IESNA). 
12.14.1  Application. The number of street lights, their location, and the lamp wattage will depend on three (3) factors, which are street classification, adjacent zoning, and urban or rural street conditions. 
1.  Street Classifications. Streets are divided into three (3) classes; arterials, collectors and local streets. Lighting requirements will be greater on arterials, less on collectors, and the least on local streets. 
2.  Adjacent Zoning. Zoning adjacent to streets will be considered when determining lighting requirements. High use areas will require greater light than large lot rural residential areas. The city engineer will review and approve lighting needs for special districts on a case-by-case basis. 
3.  Urban and Rural Streets. Urban streets with existing or planned curbs, gutters and sidewalks will require greater lighting than rural streets. 
12.14.2  Lamp Size Standards. All lamps shall be high pressure sodium unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Luminaries shall be full cut-off unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Lamp size shall be based on the following tables: 
Table A 
Traffic Intensity Based on Zoning Designations 
Low Intensity Traffic (LIT) Medium Intensity Traffic (MIT) High Intensity Traffic (HIT) SF12, MH12, PR SF6, MH6, MHP, RO, GO, NB, CI, MI, HMI, PN, PC DC, GC, RC, TC

12.  14.3 Light Standards and Placement. 
1.  Light standards shall be Type 7 poles with cobra head fixtures. Arm length and mounting height shall be determined by the application but shall not be greater than shown below. Poles shall be installed one and one-half (1.5) feet behind sidewalks less than eight feet (8') wide unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Where sidewalks are greater than eight feet (8') wide, poles shall be installed two and one-half (2.5) feet away from the face of curb. Where streets include a median and off-set sidewalks from the curb, poles shall be installed centered in the median. Pole location for rural streets will depend on street configuration and vehicle speed. Break-away bases may be required when vehicle speeds are greater than thirty-five (35) mph.

12.14.4  Decorative Street Lighting. Decorative street lighting shall follow the standards for general street lighting with the exception of the full cut-off requirement. Decorative street lighting shall conform to other code requirements related to glare. Maximum pole spacing shall be two hundred thirty feet (230') with a staggered installation. Lighting levels shall meet section 12.14.2 and the desired ambiance for the area of the city. All requests for decorative street lighting shall be approved by the city engineer on a case-by-case basis. 
12.14.5  Bike and Pedestrian Paths. Bike and pedestrian paths separated from the street network may be required to receive lighting. The city engineer shall determine the level of use, the importance of connectivity from high use zoning areas or for the public's safety. 
12.14.6  Power Conservation. The city engineer may require "part-night" control devices which allow street lights to come on at dusk and turn off after a predetermined number of hours or at a particular time. The use of these devices would be determined on a case-by-case basis and be coordinated by the city engineer with the utility provider.

Division 13 - EROSION & SEDIMENT CONTROL 
Sections: 

13.1 - Introduction. 
    Carson City is responsible for developing, implementing and enforcing a program to reduce pollutants, generated from construction activities, from entering the City's municipal storm water conveyance system. This program includes the following: 
13.1.1  Erosion & Sediment Control Ordinance, Chapter 12.18 of C.C.M.C. 
    The erosion and sediment control ordinance contains each of the following items: 
¦ Requires any person applying for a permit to develop and submit a Erosion and Sediment Control Plan with their permit application. 
¦ Requires any person who undertakes earth disturbance is subject to the ordinance. 
¦ States permit requirements and action for failure to complete the work. 
¦ States general erosion and sediment requirements and maintenance. 
¦ States procedure for notification of needed maintenance, enforcements and appeal process. 
13.1.2  Program Goals and Objectives. 
    The erosion and sediment control program minimum requirements will be applied to construction activities that result in land disturbance of greater than or equal to one acre and/or as required elsewhere in code. Reduction of storm water discharges from construction activity disturbing less than one acre will be included in the program if that construction activity is part of a larger common plan of development or sale that would disturb one acre or more. The objective of this Division is to provide guidance for avoiding adverse stormwater impacts from construction and other activities on downstream resources and on-site storm water facilities. Minimization of storm water flows, prevention of soil erosion, capture of water-borne sediment that has been unavoidably released from exposed soils, and protection of water quality from on-site pollutant sources are all readily achievable when the proper best management practices (BMPs) are planned, installed and properly maintained. 
    The construction phase of a project is usually considered a temporary condition, which will be supplanted by the permanent improvements and facilities for the completed project. However, construction work may take place over an extended period of time, including several seasons over multiple years. All management practices and control facilities used in the course of construction shall be of sufficient size, strength, and durability to readily outlast the longest possible construction schedule and the worst anticipated weather conditions. The goal of a construction storm water pollution prevention plan is to avoid immediate and long-term environmental loss and degradation typically caused by poorly managed construction sites. 
    Linear projects, such as roadway construction and utility installations, are special cases of construction activities and present their own, unique set of stormwater protection challenges. Many of the BMPs can be adapted and modified to provide the controls needed to adequately address these projects. It may be advantageous to segment long, linear projects into a series of separate units that can apply all necessary controls pertinent to that particular unit in a timely manner. 
    Soil erosion and the resulting sedimentation produced by land develop impact the environment, damage aquatic and recreational resources and create aesthetic problems. Examples of the impacts of erosion and sedimentation include: 
¦ Natural nutrient rich topsoils are eroded away, making reestablishment of vegetation difficult. Consequently, soil amendments and fertilizers must be applied. A properly functioning soil system is a sustained storm water management mechanism. Vegetation and soil are not effectively sustained unless both are maintained in good condition. 
¦ Siltation fills culverts and storm drains, decreasing capacities and increasing flooding and maintenance frequency. 
¦ Detention facilities fill rapidly with sediment, decreasing storage capacity and increasing flooding. 
¦ Infiltration devices become clogged and fail. 
¦ Sediment in streams and rivers builds more rapidly. Resulting shallow areas become covered by aquatic plants, reducing usability. Increased nutrient loading from phosphorus attached to soil particles and transported to streams can cause a change in the water pH, algal blooms and oxygen depletion that leads to eutrophication and fish kills. 
¦ Treatment of water for domestic uses becomes more difficult and costly. 
¦ Aesthetically pleasing, clear, clean water is replaced with turbid water in streams and rivers. 
¦ Eroded soil particles decrease the viability of macro-invertebrates and food-chain organisms, impair the feeding ability of aquatic animals, clog gill passages of fish, and reduce photosynthesis. 
    Successful fish spawning is diminished by sediment-clogged gravel. Sedimentation following spawning can smother the eggs or young fry. 
    The Carson City Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance and this Division on Erosion and Sediment Control follows the requirements instituted by the US Environmental Protection Agency for owner/operators of private and public construction sites. Under the Phase II National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program all construction site owners/operators of all proposed private and public construction sites that will disturb a total of one or more acres of land are required to obtain coverage under the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection's (NDEP) General Permit. The owners/operators must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) and develop and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that identifies the potential storm water pollution sources on the site and how storm water pollution will be prevented. The SWPPP remains on-site during the duration of the project. 
3.1.3  Factors Influencing Erosion. 
    Several factors influence the erosion potential of a site. These factors include: 
¦ Soil characteristics; 
¦ Vegetative cover; 
¦ Topography; and 
¦ Climate. 
(Ord. 2006-28, Development Standards). 
13.2 - Minimum requirements for erosion & sediment control. 
    The minimum requirements for erosion and sediment control on construction sites are documented through the preparation of a site plan and SWPPP detailing the BMPs that will be implemented, BMPs timing and maintenance responsibility. 
    An adequate construction SWPPP includes a narrative and drawings. The narrative is a written statement to explain and justify the pollution prevention decisions made for a particular project. The narrative contains concise information about existing site conditions, construction schedules, and other pertinent items that are not contained on the drawings. The drawing and notes describe where and when the various BMPs should be installed, the performance goals the BMPs are expected to achieve, and the actions to be taken if the performance goals are not achieved. 
    The minimum requirements for the erosion and sediment control measures that must be implemented for all projects in Carson City where one or more acres of land are disturbed are listed below. A step-by-step procedure for preparing and implementing a SWPPP is included in Division 13.3. 
    The SWPPP identifies the BMPs that will be employed to prevent sediment and pollutants from leaving the site, fulfilling the requirements of Division 13.5.4. For those projects that must obtain coverage under the NDEP General Permit, applicants may submit the SWPPP prepared for the NOI provided all of the Carson City erosion and sediment control minimum requirements are addressed in the SWPPP. 
13.2.1  Minimum Requirement No. 1: Mark Clearing Limits. 
1.  Prior to beginning land disturbing activities, including clearing and grading, all clearing limits, sensitive areas and their buffers, and trees that are to be preserved within the construction area must be clearly marked, both in the field and on the plans, to prevent damage and offsite impacts. 
2.  Plastic, metal, or stake wire fence must be used to mark the clearing limits. 
13.2.2  Minimum Requirement No. 2: Establish Construction Access.

1.  General. Properties and waterways downstream from development sites shall be protected from erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff from the project site. 
2.  Downstream Analysis. Downstream analysis is necessary if changes in flows could impair or alter conveyance systems, stream banks, bed sediments or aquatic habitats. 
3.  BMPs Functional. Stormwater retention/detention facilities shall be constructed as one of the first steps in grading. Detention facilities shall be functional prior to construction of site improvements (e.g. impervious surfaces). 
4.  Additional Flow Standards. The City Engineer may require pond designs that provide additional or different stormwater flow control if necessary to address local conditions or to protect properties and waterways downstream from erosion due to increases in the volume or velocity of stormwater runoff from the project site. 
5.  Permanent Infiltration Ponds. If permanent infiltration ponds are used for flow control during construction, these facilities should be protected from siltation during the construction phase. 
13.2.4  Minimum Requirement No. 4: Install Sediment Controls. 
1.  Natural Vegetation. The native topsoil and natural vegetation shall be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum extent practicable. 
2.  Sediment Removal BMPs. Prior to leaving a construction site, or prior to discharge to an infiltration facility, stormwater runoff from disturbed areas shall pass through a sedimentation pond or other appropriate sediment removal BMPs. Runoff from fully stabilized areas may be discharged without a sediment removal BMPs, but must meet the flow control performance standard of Minimum Requirement No. 3. Full stabilization means concrete or asphalt paving; quarry spalls used as ditch lining; or the use of rolled erosion products, a bonded fiber matrix product, or vegetative cover in a manner that will fully prevent soil erosion. The city engineer shall inspect and approve areas stabilized by means other than pavement or quarry spalls. 
3.  BMPs Functional. Sediment ponds, vegetated buffer strips, sediment barriers or filters, dikes, and other BMPs intended to trap sediment on-site shall be constructed as one of the first steps in grading. These BMPs shall be functional before other land disturbing activities take place. 
4.  Seeding. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded and mulched according to the timing indicated in Minimum Requirement No. 5. 
13.2.5  Minimum Requirement No. 5: Stabilize Soils. 
1.  General. All exposed and unworked soils shall be stabilized by application of effective BMPs that protect the soil from the erosive forces of raindrop impact and flowing water, and wind erosion. Establish temporary or permanent stabilization practices on areas that have been disturbed as soon as practical but no later than 14 days after disturbance. 
2.  Applicable Practices. Applicable practices include, but are not limited to, temporary and permanent seeding, sodding, mulching, plastic covering, soil application of polyacrylamide (PAM), early application of gravel base on areas to be paved, and dust control. 
3.  Soil Stabilization. Soil stabilization measures selected should be appropriate for the time of year, site conditions, estimated duration of use, and potential water quality impacts that stabilization agents may have on downstream waters or ground water. 
4.  Soil Stockpiles. Soil stockpiles must be stabilized and protected with sediment trapping measures. 
5.  Linear Facilities. Work on linear construction sites and activities, including right-of-way and easement clearing, roadway development, pipelines, and trenching for utilities, shall not exceed the capability of the individual contractor for his portion of the project to install the bedding materials, roadbeds, structures, pipelines, and/or utilities, and to re-stabilize the disturbed soils, meeting the timing conditions listed above. 
13.2.6  Minimum Requirement No. 6: Protect Slopes. 
1.  Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. 
2.  Soil Types. Consider soil type and its potential for erosion. 
3.  Runoff Velocities. Reduce slope runoff velocities by breaking up the continuous length of slope with terracing and diversions, decreasing slope steepness, and roughening the slope surface. 
4.  Diverted Flows. Divert upslope drainage and run-on waters from off-site with interceptors at top of slope. Off-site stormwater should be handled separately from stormwater generated on the site. Diversion of off-site stormwater around the site may be a viable option. Diverted flows shall be redirected to the natural drainage location at or before the property boundary. 
5.  Collected Flows. Contain down slope-collected flows in pipes, slope drains, or protected channels. 
6.  Ground Water. Provide drainage improvements to intercept and remove ground water, preventing seepage from flowing onto the slope surface of exposed soil areas. 
7.  Excavation. Excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches, consistent with safety and space considerations. 
8.  Check Dams. Check dams shall be placed at regular intervals within trenches that are cut down a slope. 
9.  Stabilize Soils. Stabilize soils on slopes, as specified in Minimum Requirement No. 5. 
13.2.7  Minimum Requirement No. 7: Protect Drain Inlets. 
1.  General. All storm drain inlets made operable during construction shall be protected so that stormwater runoff shall not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or treated to remove sediment. 
2.  Roads. All approach roads shall be kept clean, and all sediment and street wash water shall not be allowed to enter storm drains without prior and adequate treatment unless treatment is provided before the storm drain discharges to waters of the State. 
3.  Inlets should be inspected weekly at a minimum and daily during storm events. Inlet protection devices should be cleaned or removed and replaced before six inches of sediment can accumulate. 
13.2.8  Minimum Requirement No. 8: Stabilize Channels and Outlets. 
1.  General. All temporary on-site conveyance channels shall be designed, constructed and stabilized to prevent erosion from the expected peak flows velocity of the 6 months, 3 hour storm for the developed condition, referred to as the short duration storm. 
2.  Stabilization. Stabilization, including armoring material, adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes and downstream reaches shall be provided at the outlets of all conveyance systems. 
13.2.9  Minimum Requirement No. 9: Control Pollutants. 
1.  General. All pollutants, including waste materials and demolition debris, that occur on-site during construction shall be handled and disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of stormwater. 
2.  Vandalism. Cover, containment, and protection from vandalism shall be provided for all chemicals, liquid products, petroleum products, and non-inert wastes present on the site. 
3.  Equipment Maintenance. Maintenance and repair of heavy equipment and vehicles involving oil changes, hydraulic system drain down, solvent and de-greasing cleaning operations, fuel tank drain down and removal, and other activities which may result in discharge or spillage of pollutants to the ground or into stormwater runoff must be conducted using spill prevention measures, such as drip pans. Contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned immediately following any discharge or spill incident. Emergency repairs may be performed on-site using temporary plastic placed beneath and, if raining, over the vehicle. 
4.  Wheel Wash. Wheel wash, or tire bath wastewater, shall be discharged to a separate on-site treatment system. It may be discharged to the sanitary sewer system only if expressly allowed by the city engineer. 
5.  Agricultural Chemicals. Application of agricultural chemicals, including fertilizers and pesticides, shall be conducted in a manner and at application rates that will not result in loss of chemical to stormwater runoff. Manufacturers' recommendations shall be followed for application rates and procedures. 
6.  pH Management. Management of pH-modifying sources shall prevent contamination of runoff and stormwater collected on the site. These sources include, but are not limited to, bulk cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, new concrete washing and curing waters, waste streams generated from concrete grinding and sawing, exposed aggregate processes, and concrete pumping and mixer washout waters. 
13.2.10  Minimum Requirement No. 10: Control De-Watering. 
1.  General. All foundation, vault, and trench de-watering water, which have similar characteristics to stormwater runoff at the site, shall be discharged into a controlled conveyance system, prior to discharge to a sediment trap or sediment pond. Channels must be stabilized, as specified in Minimum Requirement No. 8. 
2.  Clean Water. Clean, non-turbid de-watering water, such as well-point ground water, can be discharged to systems tributary to state surface waters, as specified in Minimum Requirement No. 8, provided the de-watering flow does not cause erosion or flooding of the receiving waters. These clean waters should not be routed through sediment ponds with stormwater. 
3.  Contaminated Water. Highly turbid or otherwise contaminated dewatering water, such as from construction equipment operation, clamshell digging, concrete tremie pour, or work inside a cofferdam, shall be handled separately from stormwater at the site. 
4.  Other Disposal Options. Depending on site constraints, additional methods of dewatering may include: infiltration; transport off-site in a vehicle, such as a vacuum flush truck, for legal disposal in a manner that does not pollute state waters; on-site treatment using chemical treatment; or other suitable treatment technologies. 
13.2.11  Minimum Requirement No. 11: Maintain BMPs. 
1.  General. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. All maintenance and repair shall be conducted in accordance with BMPs. 
2.  Inspection. Sediment control BMPs shall be inspected by the permittee weekly or after a runoff-producing storm event. The inspection frequency for stabilized, inactive sites shall be determined by the Public Works Department, Development Engineering based on the level of soil stability and potential for adverse environmental impacts. 
3.  Remove BMPs. All temporary erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary BMPs are no longer needed. Trapped sediment shall be removed or stabilized on-site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal of BMPs or vegetation shall be permanently stabilized. 
13.2.12  Minimum Requirement No. 12: Manage The Project. 
1.  Phasing of Construction. Development projects shall be phased where feasible in order to prevent, to the maximum extent practicable, the transport of sediment from the project site during construction. Revegetation of exposed areas and maintenance of that vegetation shall be an integral part of the activities for any phase. Clearing and grading activities for developments shall be permitted only if conducted pursuant to an approved site development plan (e.g., subdivision approval) that establishes permitted areas of clearing, grading, cutting, and filling. When establishing these permitted clearing and grading areas, consideration should be given to minimizing removal of existing trees and minimizing disturbance/compaction of native soils except as needed for building purposes. These permitted clearing and grading areas and any other areas required to preserve critical or sensitive areas, buffers, native growth protection easements, or tree retention areas as may be required by the Director, shall be delineated on the site plans and the development site. 
2.  Coordination with Other Contractors. The permittee shall evaluate, with input from utilities and other contractors, the stormwater management requirements for the entire project, including the utilities, when preparing the Construction SWPPP. 
3.  Inspection. All BMPs shall be inspected, maintained, and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. Permittees or their agents should conduct construction site inspections at least once every seven days and within 24 hours of a storm event of that creates runoff at the site. Inspections should also occur prior to forecasted rain events to ensure that BMPs are in place and functioning properly. Inspections must be documented and the documents retained on site. Areas that require inspection include: 
a.  Disturbed areas that have not attained final stabilization; 
b.  Material and equipment storage areas that are exposed to precipitation; 
c.  All erosion and sediment control measures installed at the site and downstream of the site; 
d.  All structural control measures; and 
e.  All locations where vehicles enter and/or exit the site. 
4.  Modify SWPPP. Whenever inspection and/or monitoring reveals that the BMPs identified in the Construction SWPPP are inadequate, due to the actual discharge of or potential to discharge a significant amount of any pollutant, the SWPPP shall be modified, as appropriate, in a timely manner. 
5.  Construction SWPPP. The Construction SWPPP shall be retained on-site or within reasonable access to the site. The Construction SWPPP shall be modified whenever there is a significant change in the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any BMP. 
(Ord. 2006-28, Development Standards). 
13.3 - Construction stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). 
    There are three basic steps in producing an erosion and sediment control plan or Construction SWPPP. This section outlines and describes a recommended step-by-step procedure for developing a Construction SWPPP from data collection to finished product. This procedure is written in general terms to be applicable to all types of projects. 
    The Construction SWPPP is a document that describes the potential for pollution problems on a construction project. The Construction SWPPP also explains and illustrates the measures to be taken on the construction site to control those problems. 
    While it is a good idea to include standards and specifications from the Construction SWPPP in the contract documents, the Construction SWPPP should be a separate document that can stand-alone. The Construction SWPPP must be located on the construction site or within reasonable access to the site for construction and inspection personnel, although a copy of the drawings must be kept on the construction site at all times. 
    Division 13.4 includes a checklist for developing a Construction SWPPP. The Construction SWPPP may be a subset of the Technical Drainage Study, Improvement Plan or construction plan set. As site work progresses, the plan must be modified to reflect changing site conditions. The owner or lessee of the land being developed has the responsibility for Construction SWPPP preparation. The owner or lessee may designate someone (i.e., an engineer, architect, contractor, etc.) to prepare the Construction SWPPP, but he/she retains the ultimate responsibility. 
13.3.1  What is an Adequate Plan? 
    The Construction SWPPP must contain sufficient information to satisfy the Public Works Department, Development Engineering that the problems of pollution have been adequately addressed for the proposed project. An adequate Construction SWPPP includes a narrative and drawings. The narrative is a written statement to explain and justify the pollution prevention decisions made for a particular project. The narrative contains concise information about existing site conditions, construction schedules, and other pertinent items that are not contained on the drawings. The drawings and notes describe where and when the various BMPs should be installed, the performance the BMPs are expected to achieve, and actions to be taken if the performance goals are not achieved. 
    On construction sites that discharge to surface water, the primary concern in the preparation of the Construction SWPPP is compliance with Nevada Water Quality Standards. Each of the 12 elements must be included in the Construction SWPPP unless an element is determined not to be applicable to the project and the exemption is justified in the narrative. The step-by-step procedure outlined in this section is recommended for the development of the Construction SWPPPs. The checklists presented in this section may be helpful in preparing and reviewing the Construction SWPPP. 
    On construction sites that infiltrate all stormwater runoff, the primary concern in the preparation of the Construction SWPPP is the protection of the infiltration facilities from fine sediments during the construction phase and protection of ground water from other pollutants. Several of the other elements are very important at these sites as well, such as marking the clearing limits, establishing the construction access, and managing the project. 
13.3.2  BMP Standards and Specifications. 
    Division 13.5 contains references for standards and specifications for the BMPs referred to in this Division. Wherever any of these BMPs are to be employed on a site, the specific title and number of the BMP should be clearly referenced in the narrative and marked on the drawings. The standards and specifications in Division 13.5 of this Division are not intended to limit any innovative or creative effort to effectively control erosion and sedimentation. In those instances where appropriate BMPs are not in this Division, experimental management practices can be considered. Minor modifications to standard practices may also be employed. However, such practices must be approved by the city engineer before they may be used. All experimental management practices and modified standard practices are required to achieve the same or better performance than the BMPs listed in Division 13.5. 
13.3.3  General Principles. 
    The following general principals should be applied to the development of the Construction SWPPP: 
¦ The native topsoil and natural vegetation should be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum extent practicable. 
¦ Prevent pollutant release. Select source control BMPs as a first line of defense. Prevent erosion rather than treat turbid runoff. 
¦ Select BMPs depending on site characteristics (topography, drainage, soil type, ground cover, and critical areas) and the construction plan. 
¦ Divert runoff away from exposed areas wherever possible. Keep clean water clean. 
¦ Limit the extent of clearing operations and phase construction operations. 
¦ Before reseeding a disturbed soil area, amend all soils with compost wherever topsoil has been removed. 
¦ Incorporate natural drainage features whenever possible, using adequate buffers and protecting areas where flow enters the drainage system. 
¦ Minimize slope length and steepness. 
¦ Reduce runoff velocities to prevent channel erosion. 
¦ Prevent the tracking of sediment off-site. 
¦ Select appropriate BMPs for the control of pollutants other than sediment. 
¦ Be realistic about the limitations of control that you specify and the operation and maintenance of those controls. Anticipate what can go wrong, how you can prevent it from happening, and what will need to be done to fix it. 
13.3.4  Step-By-Step Procedure. 
    The development of the Construction SWPPP includes the following three steps: 
    Step 1 - Data Collection. 
    Step 2 - Data Analysis. 
    Step 3 - Construction SWPPP Development and Implementation. 
a.  Step 1 - Data Collection. 
    Evaluate existing site conditions and gather information that will help develop the most effective Construction SWPPP. The information gathered should be explained in the narrative and shown on the drawings. 
    Topography: Prepare a topographic drawing of the site to show the existing contour elevations at intervals of 1 to 5 feet depending upon the slope of the terrain. 
    Drainage: Locate and clearly mark existing drainage swales and patterns on the drawing, including existing storm drainpipe systems. 
    Soils: Identify and label soil type(s) and erodibility (low, medium, high or an index value from the NRCS manual) on the drawing. Soils information can be obtained from the "Soil Survey of Carson City Area, Nevada." Soils can be characterized for permeability, percent organic matter, and effective depth. These qualities can be expressed in averaged or nominal terms for most areas of Carson City. The information found in the Soil Survey lists the following information for each soil mapping unit or designation: 
¦ A sieve analysis of the soils. 
¦ Permeability (in/hr). 
¦ Available water-holding capacity (in/in). 
¦ The percent of organic matter. 
    Ground Cover: Label existing vegetation on the drawing. Such features as tree clusters, grassy areas, and unique or sensitive vegetation should be shown. Unique vegetation may include existing trees above a given diameter. In addition, existing denuded or exposed soil areas should be indicated. 
    Critical Areas: Delineate critical areas adjacent to or within the site on the drawing. Such features as steep slopes, streams, floodplains, wetlands, and geologic hazard areas, etc., should be shown. Delineate set backs and buffer limits for these features on the drawings. Other related jurisdictional boundaries such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) base floodplain should also be shown on the drawings. 
    Adjacent Areas: Identify existing buildings, roads, and facilities adjacent to or within the project site on the drawings. Identify existing and proposed utility locations, construction clearing limits and erosion and sediment control BMPs on the drawings. 
    Existing Encumbrances: Identify wells, existing and abandoned septic drain-fields, utilities, and site constraints. 
    Precipitation Records: Determine the average monthly rainfall and rainfall intensity for the required design storm events based on information available in the NOAA atlas. 
b.  Step 2 - Data Analysis. 
    Consider the data collected in Step 1 to visualize potential problems and limitations of the site. Determine those areas that have critical erosion hazards. The following are some important factors to consider in data analysis: 
    Topography: The primary topographic considerations are slope steepness and slope length. Because of the effect of runoff, the longer and steeper the slope, the greater the erosion potential. Erosion potential should be determined by a qualified engineer, soil professional, certified erosion control specialist, or other qualified person. 
    Drainage: Natural drainage patterns that consist of overland flow, swales and depressions should be used to convey runoff through the site to avoid constructing an artificial drainage system. Man-made ditches and waterways will become part of the erosion problem if they are not properly stabilized. Care should also be taken to ensure that increased runoff from the site will not erode or flood the existing natural drainage system. Possible sites for temporary stormwater retention and detention should be considered at this point. Direct construction away from areas of saturated soil-areas where ground water may be encountered-and critical areas where drainage will concentrate. Preserve natural drainage patterns on the site. 
    Soils: Evaluate soil properties such as surface and subsurface runoff characteristics, depth to impermeable layer, depth to seasonal ground water table, permeability, shrink-swell potential, texture, settleability, and erodibility. Develop the Construction SWPPP based on known soil characteristics. Infiltration sites should be properly protected from silt, which will reduce infiltration capacities. 
    Ground Cover: Ground cover is the most important factor in terms of preventing erosion. Existing vegetation that can be saved will prevent erosion better than constructed BMPs. Trees and other vegetation protect the soil structure. If the existing vegetation cannot be saved, consider such practices as phasing construction, temporary seeding, and mulching. Phasing of construction involves stabilizing one part of the site before disturbing another. In this way, the entire site is not disturbed at once. 
    Critical Areas: Critical areas may include flood hazard areas, mine hazard areas, slide hazard areas, sole source aquifers, wetlands, stream banks, fish-bearing streams, and other water bodies. Any critical areas within or adjacent to the development should exert a strong influence on land development decisions. Critical areas and their buffers shall be delineated on the drawings and clearly flagged in the field. Chain link fencing may be more useful than flagging to assure that equipment operators stay out of critical areas. Only unavoidable work should take place within critical areas and their buffers. Such unavoidable work will require special BMPs, permit restrictions, and mitigation plans. 
    Adjacent Areas: An analysis of adjacent properties should focus on areas upslope and down slope from the construction project. Water bodies that will receive direct runoff from the site are a major concern. The types, values, and sensitivities of and risks to downstream resources, such as private property, stormwater facilities, public infrastructure, or aquatic systems, should be evaluated. Erosion and sediment controls should be selected accordingly. 
    Timing of the Project: An important consideration in selecting BMPs is the timing and duration of the project. Projects that will last through several seasons must take all necessary precautions to remain in compliance with the water quality standards. 
c.  Step 3 - Construction SWPPP Development and Implementation. 
    After collecting and analyzing the data to determine the site limitations, the planner can then develop a Construction SWPPP. Each of the 12 minimum requirements must be considered and included in the Construction SWPPP unless site conditions render the minimum requirement unnecessary and the exemption from that element is clearly justified in the narrative of the SWPPP.

13.5 - Best management practices. 
    The following BMPs can be used on construction sites to reduce or prevent erosion, reduce or prevent the release of sediments to off-site areas and to prevention storm water pollution. The BMPs are grouped according to the main categories of: 
Erosion Control BMPs 
Sediment Control BMPs 
Management Source Control BMPs 
    The purpose of this compilation of BMPs is to provide general guidance for selecting and implementing BMPs that will eliminate or reduce the discharge of pollutants from construction sites. Many state, federal and local agencies and non-governmental groups have developed construction site BMPs handbooks. A list of the BMPs guidance and handbooks that were reviewed for this manual are listed below. The BMPs presented here include some of the most commonly used construction BMPs.

13.5.1  BMP Selection. 
    Excessive erosion and sedimentation are among the most visible water quality impacts due to construction activities. Other water quality impacts caused by construction activities include the discharge of gross pollutants such as metals, paint, nutrients, plant debris, pesticides, construction chemicals, trash, debris and floatables into storm water. Table 1 presents a matrix that identifies the most common source of storm water pollutants at construction sites.

Based on: California Stormwater BMP Handbook, Construction, 2003 
    BMPs for erosion and sediment control must be selected to meet the BMP objectives based on site-specific conditions, construction activities, and cost. The goal of construction BMPs is to minimize the disturbed areas, stabilize disturbed areas and protect slopes and channels from erosion. Several considerations for selecting BMPs for contractor activities include: 
    Is it expected to rain? Selection of a BMP is different for the rainy season versus the dry season. Consider rescheduling activities until after the rains or perform in dry season. 
    How much water is being used for construction activities? The more water used the more likely that pollutants transported by this water will reach the drainage system or be transported off-site. 
    What are the site conditions? BMPs may differ depending on whether the activity is conducted on a slope or flat ground near a drainage structure or watercourse. Conducting activities away from certain sensitive areas will reduce the cost and inconvenience of implementing BMPs. 
    What about accidents? Controls for common activities should be established, and preparations should be made to allow for quick response to accidents or spills. In the event of a spill or exposure of construction compounds, what are the contingency plans for sampling the contaminated stormwater? Can the analysis be done in the field or should laboratory analysis be required? Are sample bottles available on-site, appropriated test strips, etc? 
13.5.2  BMP Monitoring. 
    All construction site BMPs must be monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the BMP is functioning as designed. The monitoring consists of visual inspection to determine whether the BMP was implemented and maintained according to the SWPPP. Site inspections can include: 
a.  Contractor activity BMPs. 
¦ Looking for evidence of spills and resulting clean-up procedures (e.g., supplies of spill cleanup materials) 
¦ Verifying adequacy of trash receptacles 
¦ Verifying waste disposal practices (e.g., recycle vs. hazardous waste bins) 
¦ Examining integrity and use of containment structures 
¦ Verifying use of employees education programs for the various activities 
¦ Noting the location of activity (e.g., outdoor vs. indoor, concrete vs. grass) 
¦ BMPs for any chemicals or fuels not addressed in the SWPPP must be developed 
b.  Erosion and sediment control BMPs. 
¦ Are erosion and sediment control BMPs installed properly? The SWPPP BMPs should include details or references to allow for the proper construction of structural or vegetative erosion and sediment control devices. The inspector should ensure that these systems are installed according to the SWPPP in the proper locations 
¦ Are the BMPs effective? The effectiveness of the BMP would be based on the presence of sediment behind or within control devices, the presence of sediment downstream of the site, and signs of erosion in stabilized areas after a storm event 
¦ Have drainage patterns changed? If the site has undergone significant grading operations, resulting in a change of drainage patterns, adjustment to the BMPs will likely be required to address this change. The inspectors shall determine the extent of changes to the drainage pattern and the necessity for additional or reconfigured BMPs 
¦ Are areas stabilized as quickly as possible after completion of construction activities in an area? Disturbed active and inactive construction areas (inactive construction areas may be defined as areas in which no construction activity will occur for a period of 30 days or longer) should be stabilized as soon as practical. If construction, climatological, or other site conditions do not allow stabilization, the SWPPP should define alternative approaches 
¦ Are the BMPs properly maintained? Maintenance of erosion and sediment control BMPs is critical. Erosion controls should be installed as soon as practical after an area becomes inactive, and before the onset of rain. The capacity of sediment controls must be restored prior to the next rain event 
13.5.3  BMP Maintenance. 
    The construction site should be inspected on a regular basis and during and after any storm generating runoff to determine maintenance requirements and general condition of the installed system. All maintenance related to a storm event should be completed within 48 hours of the storm event. The following maintenance tasks should be performed on a regular basis: 
¦ Removal of sediment from barriers and sedimentation devices 
¦ Replacement or repair of worn or damaged silt fence fabrics 
¦ Replacement or repair of damaged structural controls 
¦ Repair of damaged soil stabilization measures 
¦ Other control maintenance as defined in each BMP fact sheet 
13.5.4  Erosion and Sediment Control BMPs. 
    Table 2 lists the BMPs contained in this Division that are primarily installed to prevent or minimize erosion on the construction site by protecting the soil surface and preventing soil particles from being detached by rainfall, flowing water or wind. In addition, several of the erosion control BMPs are appropriately used to prevent erosion due to concentrated flow on off-site areas.

A.  Erosion Control BMPs. 
1.  BMP EC-1 grading season and practices. 
    Definition. The grading season is determined by the local climate conditions. All grading, clearing, and excavation work should be conducted during this period in order to avoid climatic conditions that could increase the chances for erosion. 
    Purpose. To coordinate grading and construction activities such that bare and disturbed soil exposure is minimized during the winter snow, windy and rainy seasons. 
    Applicability. For construction or development projects in locations where there is an opportunity for snow or rain to occur to the extent that soils become saturated and surface soil erosion is possible. 
    Planning Criteria. Many counties and communities have established specific grading and construction seasons applicable to their local environment. Coordination with the local building department or public works department will clarify any regulatory requirements applicable to the development project. 
    Methods and Materials. The best time to begin construction is after the snow has melted. All grading and excavation work should be completed prior to setting in of winter. At that time, all building sites should be winterized. Grading should not take place during storm events, rain, or snow, and for the following period of time when the site is covered with snow or the soil is in a wet saturated, muddy, or unstable condition. 
2.  BMP EC-2: Preserving Natural Vegetation. 
    Purpose. The purpose of preserving natural vegetation is to reduce erosion wherever practicable. Limiting site disturbance is the single most effective method for reducing erosion. Carefully planned preservation of existing trees, vines, shrubs, and grasses can protect soil from erosion. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Preservation of existing vegetation is suitable for use on most projects 
¦ Natural vegetation should be preserved on steep slopes, near perennial and intermittent watercourses or swales, and on building sites in wooded areas 
¦ Areas where Carson City or state regulations require preservation, e.g., wetland buffers, environmentally sensitive areas 
    Design and Installation Specifications. Natural vegetation can be preserved in natural clumps or as individual trees, shrubs and vines. The preservation of individual plants is more difficult because heavy equipment is generally used to remove unwanted vegetation. The points to remember when attempting to save individual plants are: 
¦ Is the plant worth saving? Consider the location, species, size, age, vigor, and the work involved. Local governments may also have ordinances to save natural vegetation and trees 
¦ Fence or clearly mark areas around trees that are to be saved. It is preferable to keep ground disturbance away from the trees at least as far out as the drip line. 
    Plants need protection from three kinds of injuries: 
¦ Construction Equipment - This injury can be above or below the ground level. Damage results from scarring, cutting of roots, and compaction of the soil. Placing a fenced buffer zone around plants to be saved prior to construction can prevent construction equipment injuries 
¦ Grade Changes - Changing the natural ground level will alter grades, which affects the plant's ability to obtain the necessary air, water, and minerals. Minor fills usually do not cause problems although sensitivity between species does vary and should be checked. Trees can tolerate fill of 6 inches or less. For shrubs and other plants, the fill should be less. When there are major changes in grade, it may become necessary to supply air to the roots of plants. This can be done by placing a layer of gravel and a tile system over the roots before the fill is made. A tile system protects a tree from a raised grade. The tile system should be laid out on the original grade leading from a dry well around the tree trunk. The system should then be covered with small stones to allow air to circulate over the root area. Lowering the natural ground level can seriously damage trees and shrubs. The highest percentage of the plant roots are in the upper 12 inches of the soil and cuts of only 2-3 inches can cause serious injury. To protect the roots it may be necessary to terrace the immediate area around the plants to be saved. If roots are exposed, construction of retaining walls may be needed to keep the soil in place. Plants can also be preserved by leaving them on an undisturbed, gently sloping mound. To increase the chances for survival, it is best to limit grade changes and other soil disturbances to areas outside the drip line of the plant 
¦ Excavations - Protect trees and other plants when excavating for drain fields, power, water, and sewer lines. Where possible, the trenches should be routed around trees and large shrubs. When this is not possible, it is best to tunnel under them. This can be done with hand tools or with power augers. If it is not possible to route the trench around plants to be saved, then the following should be observed: 
? Cut as few roots as possible. When you have to cut, cut clean 
? Paint cut root ends with a wood dressing like asphalt base paint 
? Backfill the trench as soon as possible 
? Tunnel beneath root systems as close to the center of the main trunk to preserve most of the important feeder roots 
    Maintenance Standards. During construction, the limits of disturbance should remain clearly marked at all times. Irrigation or maintenance of existing vegetation should be described in the landscaping plan. If damage to protected trees still occurs, maintenance guidelines described below should be followed. 
¦ Verify that protective measure remain in place. Restore damaged protection measures immediately 
¦ Serious tree injuries shall be attended to by an arborist 
¦ Damage to the crown, trunk, or root system of a retained tree shall be repaired immediately 
¦ If bark damage occurs, cut back all loosened bark into the undamaged area, with the cut tapered at the top and bottom and drainage provided at the base of the wood. Limit cutting the undamaged area as much as possible 
¦ Serrate soil that has been compacted over a tree's root zone by punching holes 12 inches deep with an iron bar, and moving the bar back and forth until the soil is loosened. Place holes 18 inches apart throughout the area of compacted soil under the tree crown 
¦ Retain protective measures until all other construction activity is complete to avoid damage during site cleanup and stabilization 
3.  BMP EC-3: Buffer Zones. 
    Purpose. An undisturbed area or strip of natural vegetation or an established suitable planting that will provide a living filter to reduce soil erosion and runoff velocities. 
    Conditions of Use. Natural buffer zones are used along streams, wetlands and other bodies of water that need protection from erosion and sedimentation. Vegetative buffer zones can be used to protect natural swales and can be incorporated into the natural landscaping of an area. Critical-areas buffer zones should not be used as sediment treatment areas. These areas shall remain completely undisturbed. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. Preserving natural vegetation or plantings in clumps, blocks, or strips is generally the easiest and most successful method. 
¦ Leave all unstable steep slopes in natural vegetation 
¦ Mark clearing limits and keep all equipment and construction debris out of the natural areas. Steel construction fencing is the most effective method in protecting sensitive areas and buffers 
¦ Alternatively, wire-backed silt fence on steel posts is marginally effective. Flagging alone is typically not effective 
¦ Keep all excavations outside the drip line of trees and shrubs 
¦ Do not push debris or extra soil into the buffer zone area because it will cause damage from burying and smothering 
¦ Vegetative buffer zones for streams or other waterways shall be established by the local permitting authority or other state or federal permits or approvals 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect the area frequently to make sure flagging remains in place and the area remains undisturbed 
4.  BMP EC-4: High Visibility Plastic or Metal Fence. 
    Purpose. Fencing is intended to: (1) restrict clearing to approved limits; (2) prevent disturbance of sensitive areas, their buffers, and other areas required to be left undisturbed; (3) limit construction traffic to designated construction entrances or roads; and, (4) protect areas where marking with survey tape may not provide adequate protection. 
    Conditions of Use. To establish clearing limits, plastic or metal fence may be used: 
¦ At the boundary of sensitive areas, their buffers, and other areas required to be left uncleared 
¦ As necessary to control vehicle access to and on the site 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ High visibility plastic fence shall be composed of a high-density polyethylene material and shall be at least four feet in height. Posts for the fencing shall be steel or wood and placed every 6 feet on center (maximum) or as needed to ensure rigidity. The fencing shall be fastened to the post every six inches with a polyethylene tie. On long continuous lengths of fencing, a tension wire or rope shall be used as a top stringer to prevent sagging between posts. The fence color shall be high visibility orange. The fence tensile strength shall be 360 lbs./ft. using the ASTM D4595 testing method 
¦ Metal fences shall be designed and installed according to the manufacturer's specifications 
¦ Metal fences shall be at least 3 feet high and must be highly visible 
¦ Fences shall not be wired or stapled to trees 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ If the fence has been damaged or visibility reduced, it shall be repaired or replaced immediately and visibility restored 
5.  BMP EC-5: Access Roads. 
    Definition. Roads to provide needed access to an area should be constructed in such a way that the quality of runoff water is preserved. 
    Purpose. To provide a route for vehicle travel, for moving equipment, supplies, and products, and for providing access for proper operation and management of conservation enterprises without disturbing the quality of runoff water. 
    Applicability. Where roads are needed to provide access from a county, state, or federal highway or to provide planned travel-ways within an area. 
    Planning Criteria. 
1.  Location: Roads should be located to serve the purpose intended and to facilitate the control and disposal of surface water. 
2.  Gradient, Vertical, and Horizontal Alignment: The gradient and alignment should be adapted to the development of which it is a part. 
3.  Width: The recommended minimum width of the road-bed is 14 feet for one-way traffic and 20 feet for two-way traffic. The tread width for two-way traffic should be increased approximately 5-feet for trailer traffic. The recommended minimum shoulder width is 2-feet on each side of the tread width. Widths less than recommended minimums may be used where topography or other natural conditions restrict the width. 
4.  Side Slopes: All cuts and fills should have side slopes that are stable for the soil or soil material involved. Typically side slopes should not be steeper than 2:1 (50% slope). 
5.  Drainage: Culverts, bridges, or grade dips should be provided at all natural drainage-ways. Design of these structures should be conducted by a qualified engineer in keeping with sound engineering practices for the class of vehicle or equipment used on the road. 
    Roadside ditches should be adequate to provide surface drainage for the roadway and deep enough to serve as outlets for subsurface drainage. 
6.  Erosion Control Measures: Erosion control measures should be provided for roads, ditches, cut slopes, fill slopes, and cross drains. 
7.  Surfacing: Access roads should be given a wearing course or surface treatment when required for traffic needs, climate, erosion control, or dust control. The type of treatment will depend on local conditions, available materials, and the existing road base. Where these factors and the volume of traffic are not a problem, no special treatment of the surface is required. Sound engineering practices must be followed to ensure that the road will meet the requirements of its intended use. 
8.  Intersection with Public Highways: Traffic safety should be a prime factor in selecting the angle of intersection with public highways. Any access roads that connect to a state highway must be approved by the State Highway Department. 
    Maintenance. Roadways, drainage structures, and erosion control facilities must be maintained on an as needed basis given the site specifics of the access road to keep them operational. Proper and regular maintenance will minimize soil erosion and the degradation of surface and ground water resources. 
    Effectiveness. Proper installation and maintenance of access roads can be effective in reducing soil erosion and minimizing impacts to water quality. 

6.  BMP EC-6: Construction Road/Parking Area Stabilization. 
    Purpose. Stabilizing subdivision roads, parking areas, and other onsite vehicle transportation routes immediately after grading reduces erosion caused by construction traffic or runoff. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Roads or parking areas, whether permanent or temporary, shall be stabilized wherever they are constructed, for use by construction traffic 
¦ Fencing (see BMPs EC-4) shall be installed, if necessary, to limit the access of vehicles to only those roads and parking areas that are stabilized 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Construct on level ground where possible 
¦ On areas that will receive asphalt as part of the project, install the first lift as soon as possible 
¦ A 6-inch depth of 2- to 4-inch crushed rock, gravel base, or crushed surfacing base course shall be applied immediately after grading or utility installation. A 4-inch course of asphalt treated base (ATB) may also be used, or the road/parking area may be paved. It may also be possible to use cement or calcium chloride for soil stabilization. If cement or cement kiln dust is used for road base stabilization, pH monitoring and BMPs are necessary to evaluate and minimize the effects on stormwater. If the area will not be used for permanent roads, parking areas, or structures, a 6-inch depth of hog fuel may also be used, but this is likely to require more maintenance. Whenever possible, construction roads and parking areas shall be placed on a firm, compacted subgrade 
¦ Temporary road gradients shall not exceed 15%. Roadways shall be carefully graded to drain. Drainage ditches shall be provided on each side of the roadway in the case of a crowned section, or on one side in the case of a super-elevated section. Drainage ditches shall be directed to a sediment control BMP 
¦ Rather than relying on ditches, it may also be possible to grade the road so that runoff sheet-flows into a heavily vegetated area with well-developed topsoil. Landscaped areas are not adequate. If this area has at least 50 feet of vegetation, then it is generally preferable to use the vegetation to treat runoff, rather than a sediment pond or trap. The 50 feet shall not include wetlands. If runoff is allowed to sheet flow through adjacent vegetated areas, it is vital to design the roadways and parking areas so that no concentrated runoff is created 
¦ Storm drain inlets shall be protected to prevent sediment-laden water entering the storm drain system (see BMP SC-4) 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect stabilized areas regularly, especially after large storm events 
¦ Crushed rock, gravel base, hog fuel, etc. shall be added as required to maintain a stable driving surface and to stabilize any areas that have eroded 
¦ Following construction, these areas shall be restored to pre-construction condition or better to prevent future erosion 
7.  BMP EC-7: Dust and Wind Erosion Control. 
    Purpose. Dust control prevents wind transport of dust from disturbed soil surfaces onto roadways, drainage ways, and surface waters. Wind erosion or dust control consists of applying water or other dust palliatives as necessary to prevent or alleviate dust nuisance generated by construction activities. Covering small stockpiles or areas is an alternative to applying water or other dust palliatives. 
    Conditions of Use. 
    In areas (including roadways) subject to surface and air movement of dust where on-site and off-site impacts to roadways, drainage ways, or surface waters are likely. Wind erosion control BMPs are suitable during the following construction activities: 
¦ Construction vehicle traffic on unpaved roads 
¦ Drilling and blasting activities 
¦ Sediment tracking onto paved roads 
¦ Soils and debris storage piles 
¦ Batch drop from front-end loaders 
¦ Areas with unstabilized soil 
¦ Final grading/site stabilization 
    Limitations. 
¦ Water prevents dust only for a short period and should be applied daily (or more often) to be effective 
¦ Over watering may cause erosion 
¦ Oil or oil-treated subgrade should not be used for dust control because the oil may migrate into drainage ways and/or seep into the soil 
¦ Effectiveness depends on soil, temperature, humidity, and wind velocity 
¦ Chemically treated subgrades may make the soil water repellant, interfering with long-term infiltration and the vegetation/re-vegetation of the site. Some chemical dust suppressants may be subject to freezing, may contain solvents, and should be handled properly 
¦ Asphalt, as a mulch tack or chemical mulch, requires a 24-hour curing time to avoid adherence to equipment, worker shoes, etc. Application should be limited because asphalt surfacing may eventually migrate into the drainage system 
¦ In compacted areas, watering and other liquid dust control measures may wash sediment or other constituents into the drainage system 
    Planning Criteria. 
1.  Plan and schedule work to open the least amount of land possible at one time. Surface disturbances should be stabilized or reclaimed before additional land is disturbed. 
2.  Install permanent erosion control measures as soon as construction or development work is completed. 
3.  The irrigation water supply should be developed before land is opened so that water is available for establishing vegetation. 
4.  When possible, schedule construction and development operations during months with the least wind erosion hazard. This is usually during later summer through fall. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Vegetate or mulch areas that will not receive vehicle traffic. In areas where planting, mulching, or paving is impractical, apply gravel or landscaping rock 
¦ Limit dust generation by clearing only those areas where immediate activity will take place, leaving the remaining area(s) in the original condition, if stable. Maintain the original ground cover as long as practical 
¦ Construct natural or artificial windbreaks or windscreens. These may be designed as enclosures for small dust sources 
¦ Sprinkle the site with water until surface is wet. Repeat as needed. To prevent carryout of mud onto street, refer to Stabilized Construction Entrance (BMP SC-1) 
¦ Irrigation water can be used for dust control. Irrigation systems should be installed as a first step on sites where dust control is a concern 
¦ Spray exposed soil areas with a dust palliative, following the manufacturer's instructions and cautions regarding handling and application. Used oil is prohibited from use as a dust suppressant. Local governments may approve other dust palliatives such as calcium chloride or PAM 
¦ PAM (BMP EC-19) added to water at a rate of 0.5 lbs. per 1,000 gallons of water per acre and applied from a water truck is more effective than water alone. This is due to the increased infiltration of water into the soil and reduced evaporation. In addition, small soil particles are bonded together and are not as easily transported by wind 
¦ Adding PAM may actually reduce the quantity of water needed for dust control. Since the wholesale cost of PAM is about $ 4.00 per pound, this is an extremely cost effective dust control method 
¦ Dust control BMPs generally stabilize exposed surfaces and minimize activities that suspend or track dust particles. The following table shows dust control practices that can be applied to site conditions that cause dust

    Techniques that can be used for unpaved roads and lots include: 
¦ Lower speed limits. High vehicle speed increases the amount of dust stirred up from unpaved roads and lots 
¦ Upgrade the road surface strength by improving particle size, shape, and mineral types that make up the surface and base materials 
¦ Add surface gravel to reduce the source of dust emission. Limit the amount of fine particles (those smaller than .075 mm) to 10 to 20% 
¦ Use geotextile fabrics to increase the strength of new roads or roads undergoing reconstruction 
¦ Encourage the use of alternate paved routes, if available 
¦ Restrict use by tracked vehicles and heavy trucks to prevent damage to road surface and base 
¦ Apply chemical dust suppressants using the admix method, blending the product with the top few inches of surface material. Suppressants may also be applied as surface treatments 
¦ Pave unpaved permanent roads and other trafficked areas 
¦ Use vacuum street sweepers 
¦ Remove mud and other dirt promptly so it does not dry and then turn into dust 
¦ Limit dust-causing work on windy days 
¦ Contact your local Air Pollution Control Authority for guidance and training on other dust control measures. Compliance with the local Air Pollution Control Authority constitutes compliance with this BMP 
    Additional preventive measures include: 
¦ Schedule construction activities to minimize exposed area 
¦ Limit onsite vehicle traffic to 15 mph 
¦ Control the number and activity of vehicles on a site at any given time 
¦ Identify and stabilize key access points prior to commencement of construction 
¦ Minimize the impact of dust by anticipating the direction of prevailing winds 
¦ Direct most construction traffic to stabilized roadways within the project site 
¦ Water should be applied by means of pressure-type distributors or pipelines equipped with a spray system or hoses and nozzles that will ensure even distribution 
¦ All distribution equipment should be equipped with a positive means of shutoff 
¦ Unless water is applied by means of pipelines, at least one mobile unit should be available at all times to apply water or dust palliative to the project 
¦ If reclaimed wastewater is used, non-potable water should not be conveyed in tanks or drainpipes that will be used to convey potable water and there should be no connection between potable and non-potable supplies 
¦ Materials applied as temporary soil stabilizers and soil binders also generally provide wind erosion control benefits 
¦ Pave or chemically stabilize access points where unpaved traffic surfaces adjoin paved roads 
¦ Provide covers for haul trucks transporting materials that contribute to dust 
¦ Provide for wet suppression or chemical stabilization of exposed soils 
¦ Provide for rapid clean up of sediments deposited on paved roads. Furnish stabilized construction road entrances and vehicle wash down areas 
¦ Stabilize inactive construction sites using vegetation or chemical stabilization methods 
    Inspection and Maintenance. 
¦ Inspect and verify that activity-based BMPs are in place prior to the commencement of associated activities. While activities associated with the BMP are under way, inspect weekly during the rainy season and at two-week intervals in the non-rainy season to verify continued BMP implementation 
¦ Regular maintenance is critical to effective dust control, whether temporary or permanent measures are being utilized. Most dust control measures require frequent, often daily, or multiple times per day attention 
¦ Regular water applications are necessary given specific site conditions. Mulches should be replaced or reapplied as necessary 
¦ Vegetative cover should be established and maintained on surface disturbance areas Check areas protected to ensure coverage 
¦ Keep windbreak and barriers in good conditions by repairing or replanting any openings 
¦ Protect sensitive areas from additional surface disturbances 
    Effectiveness. Dust control will reduce sediment delivery by runoff waters, control degradation of water in nearby streams from windblown sediments and minimize the loss of topsoil. 
8.  BMP EC-8: Level Spreader. 
    Purpose. To convert concentrated flows into sheet flow for surface application at non-erosive velocities onto stabilized areas. To provide a temporary outlet for dikes and diversions consisting of an excavated depression constructed at zero grade across a slope. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Used when a concentrated flow of water needs to be dispersed over a large area with existing stable vegetation 
¦ Items to consider are: 
1. What is the risk of erosion or damage if the flow may become concentrated? 
2. Is an easement required if discharged to adjoining property? 
3. Most of the flow should be as ground water and not as surface flow 
4. Is there an unstable area downstream that cannot accept additional ground water? 
¦ Use only where the slopes are gentle, the water volume is relatively low, and the soil will adsorb most of the low flow events 
    Planning Criteria. Detailed design is not required, but extreme care must be used during construction to ensure that the outlet lip is exactly level and uniform from end to end. Failure to meet these requirements will cause concentrated flow and consequent erosion of the stabilized area. The excavation for the spreader should be on well-stabilized soils (vegetated or rock armored). 
    Determine through topographical mapping the length and degree of slope, contributing watershed and associated drainage ways. Baseline soils data should be gathered and analyzed for erodability. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Use above undisturbed areas that are stabilized by existing vegetation 
¦ Runoff to the spreader should be from areas that have been stabilized to eliminate sediment buildup in the spreader 
¦ If the level spreader has any low points, flow will concentrate, create channels and may cause erosion 
¦ Discharge area below the outlet must be uniform with a slope of less than 5H: 1V 
¦ Outlet to be constructed level in a stable, undisturbed soil profile (not on fill) 
¦ The runoff shall not concentrate after release unless intercepted by another downstream measure 
¦ The grade of the channel for the last 20 feet of the dike or interceptor entering the level spreader shall be less than or equal to 1%. The grade of the level spreader shall be 0% to ensure uniform spreading of storm runoff 
¦ A 6-inch high gravel berm placed across the level lip shall consist of washed crushed rock, 2- to 4-inch or 3/4-inch to 11/2-inch size 
¦ The spreader length shall be determined by estimating the peak flow expected from the 10-year, 24-hour design storm. The length of the spreader shall be a minimum of 15 feet for 0.1 cfs and shall be 10 feet for each 0.1 cfs there after to a maximum of 0.5 cfs per spreader. Use multiple spreaders for higher flows 
¦ The width of the spreader should be at least 6 feet 
¦ The depth of the spreader as measured from the lip should be at least 6 inches and it should be uniform across the entire length 
¦ Level spreaders shall be setback from the property line unless there is an easement for flow 
¦ Level spreaders, when installed every so often in grassy swales, keep the flows from concentrating. Materials that can be used include sand bags, lumber, logs, concrete, and pipe. To function properly, the material needs to be installed level and on contour 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ The spreader should be inspected and repaired as necessary after every runoff event to ensure that it is functioning correctly 
¦ Remove sediment as necessary 
¦ The contractor should avoid the placement of any material on the structure and should prevent construction traffic from crossing over the structure 
¦ If the spreader is damaged by construction traffic, it shall be immediately repaired

9.  BMP EC-9: Subsurface Drains. 
    Purpose. To intercept, collect, and convey ground water to a satisfactory outlet, using a perforated pipe or conduit below the ground surface. Subsurface drains are also known as "french drains." The perforated pipe provides a dewatering mechanism to drain excessively wet soils, provides a stable base for construction, improves stability of structures with shallow foundations, and reduces hydrostatic pressure to improve slope stability. 
    Conditions of Use. Use when excessive water must be removed from the soil. The soil permeability, depth to water table and impervious layers are all factors which may govern the use of subsurface drains. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Relief drains are used either to lower the water table in large, relatively flat areas, improve the growth of vegetation, or to remove surface water. They are installed along a slope and drain in the direction of the slope. They can be installed in a grid pattern, a herringbone pattern, or a random pattern 
¦ Interceptor drains are used to remove excess ground water from a slope, stabilize steep slopes, and lower the water table immediately below a slope to prevent the soil from becoming saturated. They are installed perpendicular to a slope and drain to the side of the slope. They usually consist of a single pipe or series of single pipes instead of a patterned layout 
¦ Depth and spacing of interceptor drains - The depth of an interceptor drain is determined primarily by the depth to which the water table is to be lowered or the depth to a confining layer. For practical reasons, the maximum depth is usually limited to 6 feet, with a minimum cover of 2 feet to protect the conduit 
¦ The soil should have depth and sufficient permeability to permit installation of an effective drainage system at a depth of 2 to 6 feet 
¦ An adequate outlet for the drainage system must be available either by gravity or by pumping 
¦ The quantity and quality of discharge needs to be accounted for in the receiving stream (additional detention may be required) 
¦ This standard does not apply to subsurface drains for building foundations or deep excavations 
¦ The capacity of an interceptor drain is determined by calculating the maximum rate of ground water flow to be intercepted. Therefore, it is good practice to make complete subsurface investigations, including hydraulic conductivity of the soil, before designing a subsurface drainage system 
¦ Size of drain - Size subsurface drains to carry the required capacity without pressure flow. Minimum diameter for a subsurface drain is 4 inches 
¦ The minimum velocity required to prevent silting is 1.4 ft./sec. The line shall be graded to achieve this velocity at a minimum. The maximum allowable velocity using a sand-gravel filter or envelope is 9 ft/sec. Filter material and fabric shall be used around all drains for proper bedding and filtration of fine materials. Envelopes and filters should surround the drain to a minimum of 3-inch thickness 
¦ The outlet of the subsurface drain shall empty into a sediment pond through a catch basin. If free of sediment, it can then empty into a receiving channel, swale, or stable vegetated area adequately protected from erosion and undermining 
¦ The trench shall be constructed on a continuous grade with no reverse grades or low spots 
¦ Soft or yielding soils under the drain shall be stabilized with gravel or other suitable material 
¦ Backfilling shall be done immediately after placement of the pipe. No sections of pipe shall remain uncovered overnight or during a rainstorm. Backfill material shall be placed in the trench in such a manner that the drainpipe is not displaced or damaged 
¦ Do not install permanent drains near trees to avoid the tree roots that tend to clog the line. Use solid pipe with watertight connections where it is necessary to pass a subsurface drainage system through a stand of trees 
¦ Outlet - Ensure that the outlet of a drain empties into a channel or other watercourse above the normal water level 
¦ Secure an animal guard to the outlet end of the pipe to keep out rodents 
¦ Use outlet pipe of corrugated metal, cast iron, or heavy-duty plastic without perforations and at least 10 feet long. Do not use an envelope or filter material around the outlet pipe, and bury at least two-thirds of the pipe length 
¦ When outlet velocities exceed those allowable for the receiving stream, outlet protection must be provided 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Subsurface drains shall be checked periodically to ensure that they are free-flowing and not clogged with sediment or roots 
¦ The outlet shall be kept clean and free of debris 
¦ Surface inlets shall be kept open and free of sediment and other debris 
¦ Trees located too close to a subsurface drain often clog the system with their roots. If a drain becomes clogged, relocate the drain or remove the trees as a last resort. Drain placement should be planned to minimize this problem 
¦ Where drains are crossed by heavy vehicles, the line shall be checked to ensure that it is not crushed 
10.  BMP EC-10: Pipe Slope Drains. 
    Purpose. A slope drain is a pipe used to intercept and direct surface runoff or groundwater into a stabilized watercourse, trapping device, or stabilized area. Slope drains are used with earth dikes and drainage ditches to intercept and direct surface flow away from slope areas to protect cut or fill slopes. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Pipe slope drains should be used when a temporary or permanent stormwater conveyance is needed to move the water down a steep slope to avoid erosion 
¦ Drainage for top of slope diversion dikes or swales 
¦ Drainage for top of cut and fill slopes where water can accumulate 
¦ Emergency spillway for a sediment basin 
¦ Collect clean runoff from plastic sheeting and direct it away from exposed soil 
¦ Installed in conjunction with silt fence to drain collected water to a controlled area 
¦ Used to divert small seasonal streams away from construction. They have been used successfully on culvert replacement and extension jobs. Large flex pipe can be used on larger streams during culvert removal, repair, or replacement 
¦ Connected to existing down spouts and roof drains and used to divert water away from work areas during building renovation, demolition, and construction projects There are several commercially available collectors that are attached to the pipe inlet and help prevent erosion at the inlet 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Permanent structures included in the project plans can often serve as construction BMPs if implemented early. However, the permanent structure must meet or exceed the criteria for the temporary structure 
¦ Size the pipe to convey the flow. The capacity for temporary drains shall be sufficient to handle the peak flow from a 10-year, 24-hour storm event. Permanent pipe slope drains shall be sized for the 25-year, 24-hour peak flow 
¦ Use care in clearing vegetated slopes for installation 
¦ Re-establish cover immediately on areas disturbed by installation 
¦ Use temporary drains on new cut or fill slopes 
¦ Use diversion dikes or swales to collect water at the top of the slope 
¦ Install slope drains perpendicular to slope contours 
¦ Ensure that the entrance area is stable and large enough to direct flow into the pipe 
¦ The entrance shall consist of a standard flared end section for culverts 12 inches and larger with a minimum 6-inch metal toe plate to prevent runoff from undercutting the pipe inlet. The slope of the entrance shall be at least 3%. Sand bags may also be used at pipe entrances as a temporary measure 
¦ Debris racks are recommended at the inlet. Debris racks located several feet upstream of the inlet can usually be larger than racks at the inlet, and thus provide enhanced debris protection and less plugging 
¦ Safety racks are recommended at the inlet and outlet of pipes where children or animals could become trapped 
¦ The soil around and under the pipe and entrance section shall be thoroughly compacted to prevent undercutting and gully erosion 
¦ The flared inlet section shall be securely connected to the slope drain and have watertight connecting bands 
¦ Slope drain sections shall be securely fastened together, fused or have gasketed watertight fittings, and shall be securely anchored into the soil 
¦ Thrust blocks should be installed anytime 90 degree bends are utilized. Depending on size of pipe and flow, these can be constructed with sand bags, straw bales staked in place, "t" posts and wire, or ecology blocks 
¦ Pipe needs to be secured along its full length to prevent movement. This can be done with steel "t" posts and wire. A post is installed on each side of the pipe and the pipe is wired to them. This should be done every 10-20 feet of pipe length or so, depending on the size of the pipe and quantity of water to diverted 
¦ Interceptor dikes shall be used to direct runoff into a slope drain. The height of the dike shall be at least 1 foot higher at all points than the top of the inlet pipe 
¦ The area below the outlet must be stabilized with a riprap apron (see BMP EC-13 Outlet Protection, for the appropriate outlet material) 
¦ If the pipe slope drain is conveying sediment-laden water, direct all flows into the sediment trapping facility 
¦ Recommended materials include both metal and plastic pipe, either corrugated or smooth wall 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Check inlet and outlet points regularly, especially after storms 
¦ The inlet should be free of undercutting, and no water should be going around the point of entry. If there are problems, the headwall should be reinforced with compacted earth or sand bags 
¦ The outlet point should be free of erosion and installed with appropriate outlet protection 
¦ For permanent installations, inspect pipe periodically for vandalism and physical distress such as slides and wind-throw 
¦ Normally the pipe slope is so steep that clogging is not a problem with smooth wall pipe, however, debris may become lodged in the pipe

11.  BMP EC-11: Channel Lining. 
    Purpose. To protect erodible channels by providing a channel liner using either blankets or riprap. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ When natural soils or vegetated stabilized soils in a channel are not adequate to prevent channel erosion 
¦ When a permanent ditch or pipe system is to be installed and a temporary measure is needed 
¦ In almost all cases, synthetic and organic coconut blankets are more effective than riprap for protecting channels from erosion. Blankets can be used with and without vegetation. Blanketed channels can be designed to handle any expected flow and longevity requirement. Some synthetic blankets have a predicted life span of 50 years or more, even in sunlight 
¦ Other reasons why blankets are better than rock include the availability of blankets over rock. Blankets can be delivered anywhere. Rock requires the use of dump trucks to haul and heavy equipment to place. Blankets usually only require laborers with hand tools, and sometimes a backhoe 
¦ The Federal Highway Administration recommends not using flexible liners whenever the slope exceeds 10% or the shear stress exceeds 8 lbs/ft2 
    Design and Installation. 
¦ See EC-17 for information on blankets 
¦ Disturbance of areas where riprap is to be placed should be undertaken only when final preparation and placement of the riprap can follow immediately behind the initial disturbance. Where riprap is used for outlet protection, the riprap should be placed before or in conjunction with the construction of the pipe or channel so that it is in place when the pipe or channel begins to operate 
¦ Determine the riprap size that will be stable under the flow conditions. Based on riprap gradations actually available in the area, select the size or sizes that equal or exceed the minimum size. The possibility of drainage structure damage by children shall be considered in selecting a riprap size, especially if there is nearby water or a gully in which to toss the stones 
¦ Stone for riprap shall consist of fieldstone or quarry stone of approximately rectangular shape. The stone shall be hard and angular and of such quality that it will not disintegrate on exposure to water or weathering and it shall be suitable in all respects for the purpose intended 
¦ Rubble concrete may be used provided it has a density of at least 150 pounds per cubic foot, and otherwise meets the requirement of this standard and specification 
¦ A lining of engineering filter fabric (geotextile) shall be placed between the riprap and the underlying soil surface to prevent soil movement into or through the riprap. The geotextile should be keyed in at the top of the bank 
¦ Filter fabric shall not be used on slopes greater than 1-1/2:1 as slippage may occur 
¦ Filter fabric should be used in conjunction with a layer of coarse aggregate (granular filter blanket) when the riprap to be placed is 12 inches and larger

FIGURE EC-11-2 TEMPORARY CHANNEL LINERS
From: Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington, Washington Department of Ecology, 2001 
12.  BMP EC-12: Grassed Waterways and Outlets 
    Purpose. A grassed waterway is a natural or constructed waterway or outlet with a vegetative cover of adapted grasses for safe disposal of runoff water without erosion. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ This practice applies to construction sites where concentrated runoff needs to be contained to prevent erosion or flooding and where soil and site conditions are suitable for establishing adequate grass cover 
¦ When channel slopes are generally less than 5% and space is available for a relatively large cross section 
¦ Typical uses include roadside ditches, channels at property boundaries, outlets for diversions, and other channels and drainage ditches in low areas 
¦ Channels that will be vegetated should be installed before major earthwork and hydroseeded with a bonded fiber mulch (BFM). The vegetation should be well established (i.e., 75% cover) before water is allowed to flow in the ditch. With channels that will have high flows, erosion control blankets should be installed over the hydroseed. If vegetation cannot be established from seed before water is allowed in the ditch, sod should be installed in the bottom of the ditch in lieu of hydromulch and blankets 
¦ The grass species selected must be appropriate for the Carson City area. Moisture from natural precipitation or irrigation must be adequate to establish and maintain good grass cover 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Locate the channel where it can conform to the topography and other features such as roads 
¦ Locate them to use natural drainage systems to the greatest extent possible 
¦ Avoid sharp changes in alignment or bends and changes in grade 
¦ Do not reshape the landscape to fit the drainage channel 
¦ Design velocities are to be below 5 ft/sec.; however, the design velocity should be based on soil conditions, type of vegetation, and method of establishment 
¦ An established grass or vegetated lining is required before the channel can be used to convey stormwater, unless stabilized with nets or blankets 
¦ If design velocity of a channel to be vegetated by seeding exceeds 2 ft/sec, a temporary channel liner is required. Geotextile or special mulch protection such as fiberglass roving or straw and netting provide stability until the vegetation is fully established 
¦ Check dams shall be removed when the grass has matured sufficiently to protect the ditch or swale unless the slope of the swale is greater than 4%. The area beneath the check dams shall be seeded and mulched immediately after dam removal 
¦ If vegetation is established by sodding, the permissible velocity for established vegetation may be used and no temporary liner is needed 
¦ Do not subject grass-lined channel to sedimentation from disturbed areas. Use sediment-trapping BMPs upstream of the channel 
¦ V-shaped grass channels generally apply where the quantity of water is small, such as in short reaches along roadsides. The V-shaped cross section is least desirable because it is difficult to stabilize the bottom where velocities may be high 
¦ Trapezoidal grass channels are used where runoff volumes are large and slope is low so that velocities are nonerosive to vegetated linings. (Note: it is difficult to construct small parabolic shaped channels) 
¦ Provide outlet protection at culvert ends and at channel intersections 
¦ Grass channels, at a minimum, should carry peak runoff for temporary construction drainage facilities from the 10-year, 24-hour storm without eroding. Where flood hazard exists, increase the capacity according to the potential damage 
¦ Grassed channel side slopes generally are constructed 3:1 or flatter to aid in the establishment of vegetation and for maintenance 
¦ Construct channels a minimum of 0.2 foot larger around the periphery to allow for soil bulking during seedbed preparations and sod buildup 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ During the establishment period, check grass-lined channels after every rainfall. 
¦ After grass is established, periodically check the channel; check it after every heavy rainfall event. Immediately make repairs 
¦ It is particularly important to check the channel outlet and all road crossings for bank stability and evidence of piping or scour holes 
¦ Remove all significant sediment accumulations to maintain the designed carrying capacity. Keep the grass in a healthy, vigorous condition at all times, since it is the primary erosion protection for the channel 
¦ Protect waterways from excessive grazing and vehicle use 
¦ Keep waterway clear of debris, brush, and excess growth 
¦ Fertilize as needed to maintain grass stand and plant vigor 
¦ Reseed any damaged or open areas in the grass cover 
13.  BMP EC-13: Outlet Protection. 
    Purpose. Outlet protection prevents scour at conveyance outlets and minimizes the potential for downstream erosion by reducing the velocity of concentrated stormwater flows. 
    Conditions of use. Outlet protection is required at the outlets of all ponds, pipes, ditches, or other conveyances, and where runoff is conveyed to a natural or manmade drainage feature such as a stream, wetland, or ditch when discharge velocities and energies at the outlet are sufficient to erode the immediate downstream reach. The outlet protection is a physical device composed of rock, grouted riprap, or concrete rubble, placed at the outlet of a pipe or channel to prevent scour of the soil caused by concentrated, high velocity flows. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ The receiving channel at the outlet of a culvert shall be protected from erosion by rock lining a minimum of 6 feet downstream and extending up the channel sides a minimum of 1-foot above the maximum tailwater elevation or 1-foot above the crown, whichever is higher. For large pipes (more than 18 inches in diameter), the outlet protection lining of the channel is lengthened to four times the diameter of the culvert 
¦ Standard wing walls, and tapered outlets and paved channels should also be considered when appropriate for permanent culvert outlet protection. However, rock outlet protection is usually less expensive and easier to install than concrete aprons or energy dissipaters. Rock can also serve to trap sediment and reduce flow velocities 
¦ Organic or synthetic erosion blankets, with or without vegetation, are usually more effective than rock, cheaper, and easier to install. Materials can be chosen using manufacturer product specifications. ASTM test results are available for most products and the designer can choose the correct material for the expected flow 
¦ With low flows, vegetation (including sod) can be effective 
¦ The following guidelines shall be used for riprap outlet protection: 
1. If the discharge velocity at the outlet is less than 5 fps (pipe slope less than 1%), use 2-inch to 8-inch riprap. Minimum thickness is 1-foot. 
2. For 5 to 10 fps discharge velocity at the outlet (pipe slope less than 3%), use 24-inch to 4-foot riprap. Minimum thickness is 2 feet. 
3. For outlets at the base of steep slope pipes (pipe slope greater than 3%), an engineered energy dissipater shall be used. 
¦ Filter fabric or erosion control blankets should always be used under riprap to prevent scour and channel erosion 
¦ For proper operation of apron, align apron with receiving stream and keep straight throughout its length. If a curve is needed to fit site conditions, place it in upper section of apron 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMP prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Inspect apron for displacement of the riprap and damage to the underlying fabric. Repair fabric and replace riprap that has washed away. If riprap continues to wash away, consider using larger material 
¦ Inspect for scour beneath the riprap and around the outlet. Repair damage to slopes or underlying filter fabric immediately 
¦ Clean energy dissipater if sediment builds up 
¦ Remove temporary devices as soon as the surrounding drainage area has been stabilized or at the completion of construction 
14.  BMP EC-14: Check Dams. 
    Purpose. Construction of small dams across a swale or ditch reduces the velocity of concentrated flow and dissipates energy at the check dam. Check dams reduce the effective slope of the channel, thereby reducing the velocity of flowing water, allowing sediment to settle and reducing erosion. Check dams also help keep the flow spread evenly across the bottom of wide trapezoidal cross sections, thus helping to prevent scouring. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Where temporary channels or permanent channels are not yet vegetated, channel lining is infeasible, and velocity checks are required 
¦ To promote sedimentation behind the dam 
¦ To prevent erosion by reducing the velocity of channel flow in small intermittent channels and temporary swales 
¦ In small open channels that drain 10 acres or less 
¦ In steep channels where stormwater runoff velocities exceed 5 ft/s 
¦ In wide trapezoidal cross sections to keep flow spread evenly 
    Limitations. 
¦ Not to be used in live streams or in channels with extended base flows 
¦ Not appropriate in channels that drain areas greater than 10 acres 
¦ Not appropriate in channels that are already grass-lined unless erosion is expected, as installation may damage vegetation 
¦ Require extensive maintenance following high velocity flows 
¦ Promotes sediment trapping which can be re-suspended during subsequent storms or removal of the check dam 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Whatever material is used, the dam should form a triangle when viewed from the side. This prevents undercutting as water flows over the face of the dam rather than falling directly onto the ditch bottom 
¦ Check dams in association with sumps work more effectively at slowing flow and retaining sediment than just a check dam alone. A deep sump should be provided immediately upstream of the check dam 
¦ In some cases, if carefully located and designed, check dams can remain as permanent installations with very minor regrading. They may be left as either spillways, in which case accumulated sediment would be graded and seeded, or as check dams to prevent further sediment from leaving the site 
¦ Check dams can be constructed of either rock or pea-gravel filled bags. Numerous products are also available for this purpose. They tend to be re-usable, quick and easy to install, effective, and cost efficient 
¦ Design check dams so that the capacity of the waterway remains adequate for the design flow 
¦ Check dams should be placed perpendicular to the flow of water 
¦ The maximum spacing between the dams shall be such that the toe of the upstream dam is at the same elevation as the top of the downstream dam 
¦ Keep the maximum height at 2 feet at the center of the dam 
¦ Keep the center of the check dam at least 12 inches lower than the outer edges at natural ground elevation 
¦ Keep the side slopes of the check dam at 2:1 or flatter 
¦ Key the stone into the ditch banks and extend it beyond the abutments a minimum of 18 inches to avoid washouts from overflow around the ends of the dam 
¦ Use filter fabric foundation under a rock or sand bag check dam. If a blanket ditch liner is used, this is not necessary. A piece of organic or synthetic blanket cut to fit will also work for this purpose 
¦ Rock check dams shall be constructed of appropriately sized rock. The rock must be placed by hand or by mechanical means (no dumping of rock to form dam) to achieve complete coverage of the ditch or swale and to ensure that the center of the dam is lower than the edges. The rock used must be large enough to stay in place given the expected design flow velocities through the channel 
¦ In the case of grass-lined ditches and swales, all check dams and accumulated sediment shall be removed when the grass has matured sufficiently to protect the ditch or swale - unless the slope of the swale is greater than 4%. The area beneath the check dams shall be seeded and mulched immediately after dam removal 
¦ Ensure that channel appurtenances, such as culvert entrances below check dams, are not subject to damage or blockage from displaced stones 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Replace missing rock, bags, bales, etc. Replace bags or bales that have degraded or have become damaged 
¦ If the check dam is used as a sediment capture device, sediment that accumulates in the BMP must be periodically removed in order to maintain BMP effectiveness Sediment should be removed when the sediment accumulation reaches one-third of the barrier height. Sediment removed during maintenance may be incorporated into earthwork on the site or disposed at an appropriate location 
¦ If significant erosion occurs between dams, install a protective riprap liner in that portion of the channel 
¦ Remove check dam and accumulated sediment when check dams are no longer needed

15.  BMP EC-15: Wood Chip, Straw, and Bark mulches. 
    Purpose. Wood chips, straw, and bark mulches are used in landscape areas as ornamental decoration, soil stabilization, and areas recently seeded. Mulches are used to protect the soil surface from raindrop and irrigation impact, to create a microenvironment, to increase infiltration, to conserve moisture around tree and shrub plantings, to prevent soil compaction or crusting and to decrease runoff. 
    Applicability. Bark and wood chip mulches as applicable to any landscape area where trees and shrubs have been planted. Straw mulch is utilized in new seedings to create a microenvironment, protect the soil surface and improve seed germination. 
    Planning Criteria. Wood chips can be produced on-site by processing tree trunks, limbs, and branches in a wood chipper. Chips should range in size from 1/2- to 3-inches in length, 1/2- to 1-1/2-inches in width, and 1/3 - to 1/2-inch in thickness. Chips produced from tree trimmings with significant quantities of leaves or small twigs are not effective as mulch. Straw mulches are widely used in revegetation projects. Straw must be anchored to the soil by one or more of the following methods to prevent wind blowing: 
¦ Crimping, rolling, disking, or punching 
¦ Covering with netting or 
¦ Spraying with a chemical or tackifier 
    The steeper the slope or in wind prone areas, the greater the need for anchoring the straw. Bark requires a large tree source for on site processing or it can be purchased in varying sizes. The larger sizes, greater than 6-inches, withstand wind and are not as likely to move. 
    Methods and Materials. Wood or bark chips may be processed from any clean, green, soft wood. A permeable landscape cloth should be placed over the soil surface and the chips blown or spread by hand to a uniform thickness, which fully covers the project area. Excess chips can be safely returned to the undisturbed forest floor to supplement existing organic cover. Chips should not be used on decomposed granite slopes over 30%. 
    Only clean wheat, barley, oat or rice straw should be utilized to prevent the spread of noxious weeds. Straw can be blown on or applied by hand to a uniform depth of approximately 2-inches or approximately 2 tons per acre. The straw must be anchored by an appropriate method immediately after application. Slopes steeper than 3:1 and areas adjacent to streams or drainages should be netted to prevent sliding of material and material entering the watercourse. 
    Maintenance. Mulched areas must be regularly inspected for damage and remulched as necessary. Inspections and repairs should also be conducted after precipitation or storm events. 
    Effectiveness. Wood chip and bark mulches deteriorate slower than the wood fiber in hydromulches and, therefore, retain their effectiveness longer. Wood chips and bark are heavier than straw and less subject to removal by wind. Straw mulch is very effective if it is applied, anchored, and maintained properly. 
16.  BMP EC-16: Plastic Covering. 
    Purpose. Plastic covering provides immediate, short-term erosion protection to slopes and disturbed areas. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Plastic covering may be used on disturbed areas that require cover measures for less than 30 days, except as stated below 
¦ Plastic is particularly useful for protecting cut and fill slopes and stockpiles. Note: The relatively rapid breakdown of most polyethylene sheeting makes it unsuitable for long-term (greater than six months) applications 
¦ Clear plastic sheeting can be used over newly-seeded areas to create a greenhouse effect and encourage grass growth if the hydroseed was installed too late in the season to establish 75% grass cover, or if the wet season started earlier than normal. Clear plastic should not be used for this purpose during the summer months because the resulting high temperatures can kill the grass 
¦ Due to rapid runoff caused by plastic sheeting, this method shall not be used upslope of areas that might be adversely impacted by concentrated runoff. Such areas include steep and/or unstable slopes 
¦ While plastic is inexpensive to purchase, the added cost of installation, maintenance, removal, and disposal make this an expensive material, up to $1.50-2.00 per square yard 
¦ Whenever plastic is used to protect slopes, water collection measures must be installed at the base of the slope. These measures include plastic-covered berms, channels, and pipes used to convey clean rainwater away from bare soil and disturbed areas. At no time is clean runoff from a plastic covered slope to be mixed with dirty runoff from a project 
¦ Other uses for plastic include: 
1. Temporary ditch liner. 
2. Pond liner in temporary sediment pond. 
3. Liner for bermed temporary fuel storage area if plastic is not reactive to the type of fuel being stored. 
4. Emergency slope protection during heavy rains and 
5. Temporary drainpipe ("elephant trunk") used to direct water. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Plastic slope cover must be installed as follows: 
1. Run plastic up and down slope, not across slope. 
2. Plastic may be installed perpendicular to a slope if the slope length is less than 10 feet. 
3. Minimum of 8-inch overlap at seams. 
4. On long or wide slopes, or slopes subject to wind, all seams should be taped. 
5. Place plastic into a small (12-inch wide by 6-inch deep) slot trench at the top of the slope and backfill with soil to keep water from flowing underneath. 
6. Place sand filled burlap or geotextile bags every 3 to 6 feet along seams and pound a wooden stake through each to hold them in place. 
7. Inspect plastic for rips, tears, and open seams regularly and repair immediately. This prevents high velocity runoff from contacting bare soil that causes extreme erosion. 
8. Sandbags may be lowered into place tied to ropes. However, all sandbags must be staked in place. 
¦ Plastic sheeting shall have a minimum thickness of 0.06 millimeters (2.5 mils) 
¦ If erosion at the toe of a slope is likely, a gravel berm, riprap, or other suitable protection shall be installed at the toe of the slope in order to reduce the velocity of runoff 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Torn sheets must be replaced and open seams repaired 
¦ If the plastic begins to deteriorate due to ultraviolet radiation; it must be completely removed and replaced 
¦ When the plastic is no longer needed it shall be completely removed 
17.  BMP EC-17: Jute & Synthetic Netting and Blankets. 
    Purpose. Erosion control nets and blankets are intended to prevent erosion and hold seed and mulch in place on steep slopes and in channels so that vegetation can become well established. Netting provides stability to surface disturbances and reduces the soil erosion potential. 
    Nets (commonly called matting) are strands of material woven into an open, but high-tensile strength net (for example, coconut fiber matting). Blankets are strands of material that are not tightly woven, but instead form a layer of interlocking fibers, typically held together by a biodegradable or photodegradable netting (for example, excelsior or straw blankets). They generally have lower tensile strength than nets, but cover the ground more completely. Coir (coconut fiber) fabric comes as both nets and blankets. 
    Netting is applicable to any situation that straw or wood chip mulch is utilized. Typical applications include: revegetation of surface disturbances, road cut and fill slopes, ski slopes, mine reclamation sites, etc. Netting can be utilized in both temporary and permanent applications. 
    Conditions of Use. Erosion control nets and blankets should be used: 
¦ To aid permanent vegetated stabilization of slopes 2H: 1V or greater and with more than 10 feet of vertical relief 
¦ For drainage ditches and swales (highly recommended). The application of appropriate netting or blanket to drainage ditches and swales can protect bare soil from channelized runoff while vegetation is established. Nets and blankets also can capture a great deal of sediment due to their open, porous structure. Synthetic nets and blankets can be used to permanently stabilize channels and may provide a cost-effective, environmentally preferable alternative to riprap. 100% synthetic blankets manufactured for use in ditches may be easily reused as temporary ditch liners 
    Disadvantages of blankets include: 
¦ Surface preparation required 
¦ On slopes steeper than 2.5:1, blanket installers may need to be roped and harnessed for safety 
¦ They cost at least $4,000-6,000 per acre installed 
    Advantages of blankets include: 
¦ Can be installed without mobilizing special equipment 
¦ Can be installed by anyone with minimal training 
¦ Can be installed in stages or phases as the project progresses 
¦ Seed and fertilizer can be hand-placed by the installers as they progress down the slope 
¦ Can be installed in any weather 
¦ There are numerous types of blankets that can be designed with various parameters in mind. Those parameters include: fiber blend, mesh strength, longevity, biodegradability, cost, and availability 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Seed and/or mulch the disturbed areas 
¦ Starting above the mulched and/or seeded area, anchor the top end of the netting by burying it in a trench at least 4 inches deep by 8 inches wide; backfill and compact the excavated material into this trench 
¦ The netting should extend beyond the edge of the mulched or seeded area at least 1 foot on the sides, and 3 feet at the top and bottom. Fasten with a row of wire stapes on 1-foot centers 
¦ Roll the netting out, perpendicular with the slope and secure with staples on 3-foot centers. The "U" shaped staples should be 6 inches to 10 inches long, with a 1-inch crown. Longer staples should be used in loose or sandy soils 
¦ Overlap netting at least 1 foot on the sides and secure with staples on 1-foot centers along the overlap 
¦ Overlap the lower end of the uphill strip over the downhill strip at least 1 foot and secure with staples on 1 foot centers 
¦ Continue adding strips of netting until the entire mulched area is covered and secured with staples 
¦ The netting should be cut to fit around protruding rocks or other large objects, and tucked in around smaller rocks or objects preventing "bridging" 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Good contact with the ground must be maintained, and erosion must not occur beneath the net or blanket 
¦ Any areas of the net or blanket that are damaged or not in close contact with the ground shall be repaired and stapled 
¦ If erosion occurs due to poorly controlled drainage, the problem shall be fixed and the eroded area protected

18.  BMP EC-18: Rock riprap. 
    Purpose. Rock riprap is a layer of loose rock placed over an erodible soil or surface disturbance to protect the soil surface, provide for slope stabilization on steep slopes and reduce soil erosion within a project area. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Rock riprap is primarily utilized in drainage stabilization projects such as channel and ditch linings and energy dissipaters 
¦ Rock riprap is used on steep, difficult slopes where vegetation has not been successful 
¦ Seed, shrubs, and trees have been incorporated with rock riprap by interplanting 
¦ A source of rock riprap of the appropriate size and the associated transportation cost are the primary planning criteria 
¦ Depending upon the application, rock riprap can be utilized with revegetation efforts but the establishment of permanent vegetation is preferred for long-term stability and maintenance 
¦ Rock riprap applied to active drainage-ways or channels usually requires an underlining of matting or fabric to prevent erosion 
¦ Rock riprapping is an effective means of reducing soil erosion in channels and drainage-ways 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ The rock riprap should be sound, dense, and durable rock with a specific gravity of not less than 2-1/2 and greater than 12 inches in diameter 
¦ Seeding should occur prior to rock placement 
¦ If to be used within an active drainage channel, a synthetic mat or fabric should be installed prior to rock placement 
¦ Depending on the specifics of the site, rock riprap can be placed by hand or by equipment 
¦ Existing trees and vegetation should be protected and rock riprap placed by hand in these areas 
¦ Rocks should be securely bedded and homogenous in the layering 
¦ Depth of application depends upon the size of the drainage-way, slope degree and length and the other specifics of the site 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMP prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Inspect for displacement of the riprap and damage to the underlying fabric. Repair fabric and replace riprap that has washed away. If riprap continues to wash away, consider using larger material 
¦ Inspect for scour beneath the riprap and repair immediately 
¦ Remove temporary devices as soon as the surrounding drainage area has been stabilized or at the completion of construction 
19.  BMP EC-19: Polyacrylamide (PAM) for Soil Erosion Protection. 
    Purpose. Polyacrylamide (PAM) is used on construction sites to prevent soil erosion. Applying PAM to bare soil in advance of a rain event significantly reduces erosion and controls sediment in two ways. First, PAM increases the soil's available pore volume, thus increasing infiltration through flocculation and reducing the quantity of stormwater runoff. Second, it increases flocculation of suspended particles and aids in their deposition, thus reducing stormwater runoff turbidity and improving water quality. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ PAM is suitable for use on disturbed soil area that discharge to a sediment trap or sediment basin 
¦ PAM is typically used in conjunction with other BMPs to increase their performance 
¦ PAM can be applied to the following areas: 
? Rough graded soils that will be inactive for a period of time 
? Final graded soils before application of final stabilization (e.g., paving, planting, mulching) 
? Haul roads prior to placement of crushed rock surfacing 
? Compacted soil road base 
? Construction staging, materials storage, and layout areas 
? Soil stockpiles 
? Areas that will be mulched 
    Limitations. 
¦ PAM must not be directly applied to water or allowed to enter a water body 
¦ Do not use PAM on a slope that flows into a water body without passing through a sediment trap or sediment basin 
¦ PAM will work when applied to saturated soil but is not as effective as applications to dry or damp soil 
¦ On all sites, the use of silt fence shall be maximized to limit the discharges of sediment from the site 
¦ All areas not being actively worked shall be covered and protected from rainfall. PAM shall not be the only cover BMP used 
¦ Some PAMs are more toxic and carcinogenic than others. Only the most environmentally safe PAM products should be used 
¦ PAM designated for erosion and sediment control should be "water soluble" or "linear" or "non-cross linked" 
¦ PAM, combined with water, is very slippery and can be a safety hazard. Care must be taken to prevent spills of PAM powder onto paved surfaces. During an application of PAM, prevent over-spray from reaching pavement, as pavement will become slippery. If PAM powder gets on skin or clothing, wipe it off with a rough towel rather than washing with water-this only makes cleanup messier and take longer 
¦ A sampling and analysis plan must be incorporated into the SWPPP as PAM may be considered to be a source of non-visible pollutants 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ PAM may be applied in dissolved form with water, or it may be applied in dry, granular or powdered form. The preferred application method is the dissolved form. PAM is to be applied at a maximum rate of 1/2 pound PAM per 1000 gallons water per 1 acre of bare soil. Higher concentrations of PAM do not provide any additional effectiveness 
¦ Pre-measure the area where PAM is to be applied and calculate the amount of product and water necessary to provide coverage at the specified application rate (1/2 pound PAM/1000 gallons/acre) 
¦ PAM has infinite solubility in water, but dissolves very slowly. Dissolve pre-measured dry granular PAM with a known quantity of clean water in a bucket several hours or overnight. Mechanical mixing will help dissolve the PAM. Always add PAM to water - not water to PAM 
¦ Pre-fill the water truck about 1/8 full with water. The water does not have to be potable, but it must have relatively low turbidity - in the range of 20 NTU or less. 
¦ Add PAM/water mixture to the truck 
¦ Completely fill the water truck to specified volume 
¦ Spray PAM/water mixture onto dry soil until the soil surface is uniformly and completely wetted 
¦ PAM may be applied as a powder at the rate of 5 lbs. per acre. This must be applied on a day that is dry. For areas less than 5-10 acres, a hand-held "organ grinder" fertilizer spreader set to the smallest setting will work. Tractor-mounted spreaders will work for larger areas 
    Maintenance Standards. The following shall be used for application of PAM: 
¦ PAM may be reapplied on actively worked areas after a 48-hour period 
¦ Proper application and re-application plans are necessary to ensure total effectiveness of PAM usage 
¦ Reapplication is not required unless PAM treated soil is disturbed or unless turbidity levels show the need for an additional application. If PAM treated soil is left undisturbed a reapplication may be necessary after two months. More PAM applications may be required for steep slopes, silty and clayey soils (USDA Classification Type "C" and "D" soils), long grades, and high precipitation areas. When PAM is applied first to bare soil and then covered with straw, a reapplication may not be necessary for several months 
20.  BMP EC-20: Topsoiling. 
    Purpose. To provide a suitable growth medium for final site stabilization with vegetation. While not a permanent cover practice in itself, topsoiling is an integral component of providing permanent cover in those areas where there is an unsuitable soil surface for plant growth. Native soils and disturbed soils that have been organically amended not only retain much more stormwater, but they also serve as effective biofilters for urban pollutants and, by supporting more vigorous plant growth, reduce the water, fertilizer and pesticides needed to support installed landscapes. Topsoil does not include any subsoils but only the material from the top several inches including organic debris. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Native soils should be left undisturbed to the maximum extent practicable. Native soils disturbed during clearing and grading should be restored, to the maximum extent practicable, to a condition where moisture-holding capacity is equal to or better than the original site conditions. This criterion can be met by using on-site native topsoil, incorporating amendments into on-site soil, or importing blended topsoil 
¦ Topsoiling is a required procedure when establishing vegetation on shallow soils, and soils of critically low pH (high acid) levels 
¦ Stripping of existing, properly functioning soil system and vegetation for the purpose of topsoiling during construction is not acceptable. If an existing soil system is functioning properly it shall be preserved in its undisturbed and uncompacted condition 
¦ Depending on where the topsoil comes from, or what vegetation was on site before disturbance, invasive plant seeds may be included and could cause problems for establishing native plants, landscaped areas, or grasses 
¦ Topsoil from the site will contain mycorrhizal bacteria that are necessary for healthy root growth and nutrient transfer. These native mycorrhiza are acclimated to the site and will provide optimum conditions for establishing grasses. Commercially available mycorrhiza products should be used when topsoil is brought in from off-site 
    Design and Installation Specifications. If topsoiling is to be done, the following items should be considered: 
¦ Maximize the depth of the topsoil wherever possible to provide the maximum possible infiltration capacity and beneficial growth medium. Topsoil depth shall be at least 8 inches with a minimum organic content of 10% dry weight and pH between 6.0 and 8.0 or matching the pH of the undisturbed soil. This can be accomplished either by returning native topsoil to the site and/or incorporating organic amendments. Organic amendments should be incorporated to a minimum 8-inch depth except where tree roots or other natural features limit the depth of incorporation. Subsoils below the 12-inch depth should be scarified at least 2 inches to avoid stratified layers, where feasible. The decision to either layer topsoil over a subgrade or incorporate topsoil into the underlying layer may vary depending on the planting specified 
¦ If blended topsoil is imported, fines should be limited to 25% passing through a 200 sieve 
¦ The final composition and construction of the soil system will result in a natural selection of certain plant species over time 
¦ Locate the topsoil stockpile so that it meets specifications and does not interfere with work on the site. It may be possible to locate more than one pile in proximity to areas where topsoil will be used 
¦ Allow sufficient time in scheduling for topsoil to be spread prior to seeding, sodding, or planting 
¦ Care must be taken not to apply to subsoil if the two soils have contrasting textures. Sandy topsoil over clayey subsoil is a particularly poor combination, as water creeps along the junction between the soil layers and causes the topsoil to slough 
¦ If topsoil and subsoil are not properly bonded, water will not infiltrate the soil profile evenly and it will be difficult to establish vegetation. The best method to prevent a lack of bonding is to actually work the topsoil into the layer below for a depth of at least 6 inches 
¦ Ripping or re-structuring the subgrade may also provide additional benefits regarding the overall infiltration and interflow dynamics of the soil system 
¦ Field exploration of the site shall be made to determine if there is surface soil of sufficient quantity and quality to justify stripping 
¦ Topsoil shall be friable and loamy (loam, sandy loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam). Areas of natural ground water recharge should be avoided 
¦ Stripping shall be confined to the immediate construction area. A 4- to 6- inch stripping depth is common, but depth may vary depending on the particular soil. All surface runoff control structures shall be in place prior to stripping 
    Stockpiling of topsoil shall occur in the following manner: 
¦ Side slopes of the stockpile shall not exceed 2:1 
¦ An interceptor dike with gravel outlet and silt fence shall surround all topsoil stockpiles during the rainy season or if the stockpile will remain in place for a longer period of time than active construction grading 
¦ Erosion control seeding or covering with clear plastic or other mulching materials of stockpiles shall be completed within 7 days of the formation of the stockpile. Native topsoil stockpiles shall not be covered with plastic 
¦ Topsoil shall not be placed while in a frozen or muddy condition, when the subgrade is excessively wet, or when conditions exist that may otherwise be detrimental to proper grading or proposed sodding or seeding 
¦ Previously established grades on the areas to be topsoiled shall be maintained according to the approved plan 
¦ When native topsoil is to be stockpiled and reused the following should apply to ensure that the mycorrhizal bacterial, earthworms, and other beneficial organisms will not be destroyed: 
1 Topsoil is to be re-installed within 4 to 6 weeks. 
2 Topsoil is not to become saturated with water. 
3 Plastic cover is not allowed. 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect stockpiles regularly, especially after large storm events. Stabilize any areas that have eroded 
21.  BMP EC-21: Seeding Practices. 
    Purpose. Seeding practices include a variety of techniques, which result in the sowing, or planting of seeds. Common practices include broadcast seeding (hand or mechanical), drill seeding, aerial seeding, and hydroseeding. The primary purpose of seeding a site is for soil stabilization through the establishment of a vegetative cover. Related objectives include: to reduce raindrop impacts and surface water flow, to reduce erosion from wind and water and to enhance aesthetics and the natural environment. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Seeding practices are applicable to any surface disturbance site requiring revegetation or reclamation 
¦ Slopes must be mechanically stabilized prior to seeding, as vegetation alone will not stabilize a slope 
¦ Drilling seeding is typically limited to slopes of 3:1 or flatter, but it is the most successful practice 
¦ Hydroseeding is most effective in steep slope situations, which have little or no access (e.g., road cut or fill slopes, mine waste dumps, etc.) 
¦ Broadcast seeding is less expensive but requires approximately twice the amount of seed over drill seeding 
¦ Aerial seedings are typically applied in large areas with no access, such as forest or rangeland fires 
¦  
¦  
    Planning Criteria. 
¦ The establishment of vegetation is the most efficient and cost effective form of erosion control and soil stabilization. Once established vegetation absorbs raindrop impact and prevents the mobilization of soil particles. Vegetation prevents erosion while other treatments such as filter fabric, sediment basins or filter strips only treat the sediment mobilization process 
¦ Seeding practices should be selected based upon the specifics of the site and the expertise of a qualified professional should be consulted 
¦ Typically economics, site topography and/or access are controlling factors in the selection process. Seeding practices should also be tailored to the plant material seed being applied (i.e. grasses, forbs, shrubs) 
¦ Tree species are typically planted from container stock after establishment of a grass/forb/shrub cover 
¦ Seeding practices are usually incorporated within a combined structural and vegetative approach to soil stabilization 
¦ Vegetation alone will not stabilize a slope. Other nonvegetative techniques are also utilized to enhance the success of a seeding such as mulches, netting, matting, and chemical tacifiers 
¦ Irrigation will assist in achieving a good seed/soil contact and is critical to plant establishment on dry sites. Over watering will cause washing and runoff, thus potentially transporting seed down gradient 
    Design and Installation Specifications. Vegetation or reclamation specialists should be consulted regarding mulch application rates, plant species selection, seeding rates, etc., to ensure a successful project. 
¦ Broadcast seeding (hand or mechanical): Broadcast seeding can be accomplished by hand held seeders or a mechanically driven seeder typically mounted on a tractor or ATV vehicle. The seed mix is placed in a hopper, adjustments are made for the size of the seed and rate of application, and the seeder is operated by a hand crank or motor while walking or driving over the areas to be seeded. Broadcast seeding typically require twice the amount of seed to cover the same given area as a drill seeder due to wind drift, wildlife consumption, and lack of good soil to seed contact 
¦ Drill seeding: Drill seeding requires the use of a Range drill or equivalent depending on the condition of the site. Drill seeders are pulled behind a tractor or bulldozer and actually place the seed to a pre-determined depth. The seed is then covered by the drill mechanism or a chain drag is utilized to cover the seed behind the drill. Drill seeding provides the best seed to soil contact and correspondingly the highest success rate 
¦ Aerial seeding: Aerial seeding is conducted by helicopter or fixed wing aircraft and can cover larger areas of inaccessible terrain. It is the most efficient method for large disturbance areas such as forest or rangeland fires. Germination success is usually low given wind drift, soil conditions, and poor seed to soil contact, but application timing can greatly improve success. If seeding can occur shortly after a wild land fire and before a soil crust is formed, success is greatly improved 
¦ Hydroseeding: The wood fiber and water mixture are well agitated in a large tank and then blown through a hose and nozzle by compressed air. The apparatus is typically truck or trailer mounted and has sufficient capacity to complete several acres at a time. Mulch application rates and/or seeding rates depend upon the site specifics of the project area and the project goals. Typically irrigation is necessary to successfully establish a vegetative cover with hydroseeding 
    Maintenance. 
¦ Seeded areas require regular inspection and potentially reapplication if necessary 
¦ The treatment areas should be protected from foot or vehicle traffic until vegetation is well established which may require fencing, barriers, and signing 
22.  BMP EC-22: Sodding. 
    Purpose. The purpose of sodding is to establish permanent turf for immediate erosion protection and to stabilize drainage ways where concentrated overland flow will occur. 
    Conditions of Use. Sodding may be used in the following areas: 
¦ Disturbed areas that require short-term or long-term cover 
¦ Disturbed areas that require immediate vegetative cover 
¦ All waterways that require vegetative lining. Waterways may also be seeded rather than sodded, and protected with a net or blanket 
    Design and Installation Specifications. Sod shall be free of weeds, of uniform thickness (approximately 1-inch thick), and shall have a dense root mat for mechanical strength. The following steps are recommended for sod installation: 
¦ Shape and smooth the surface to final grade in accordance with the approved grading plan. The swale needs to be over excavated 4 to 6 inches below design elevation to allow room for placing soil amendment and sod 
¦ Amend 4 inches (minimum) of compost into the top 8 inches of the soil if the organic content of the soil is less than ten percent or the permeability is less than 0.6 inches per hour. Compost used should meet Ecology publication 94-038 specifications for Grade "A" quality compost 
¦ Fertilize according to the supplier's recommendations 
¦ Work lime and fertilizer 1 to 2 inches into the soil, and smooth the surface 
¦ Lay strips of sod beginning at the lowest area to be sodded and perpendicular to the direction of water flow. Wedge strips securely into place. Square the ends of each strip to provide for a close, tight fit. Stagger joints at least 12 inches. Staple on slopes steeper than 3H: 1V. Staple the upstream edge of each sod strip 
¦ Roll the sodded area and irrigate 
¦ When sodding is carried out in alternating strips or other patterns, seed the areas between the sods immediately after sodding 
    Maintenance Standards. If the grass is unhealthy, the cause shall be determined and appropriate action taken to reestablish a healthy groundcover. If it is impossible to establish a healthy groundcover due to frequent saturation, instability, or some other cause, the sod shall be removed, the area seeded with an appropriate mix, and protected with a net or blanket. 
B.  Sediment Control BMPs. 
1.  BMP SC-1: Stabilized Construction Entrance. 
    Purpose. Construction entrances are stabilized to reduce the amount of sediment transported onto paved roads by vehicles or equipment by constructing a stabilized pad of quarry spalls at entrances to construction sites. 
    Conditions of Use. Construction entrances shall be stabilized wherever traffic will be leaving a construction site and traveling on paved roads or other paved areas within 1,000 feet of the site. On large commercial, highway, and road projects, the designer should include enough extra materials in the contract to allow for additional stabilized entrances not shown in the initial Construction SWPPP. It is difficult to determine exactly where access to these projects will take place; additional materials will enable the contractor to install them where needed. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ A separation geotextile shall be placed under the spalls to prevent fine sediment from pumping up into the rock pad. The geotextile shall meet the following standards: 
? Grab Tensile Strength (ASTM D4751) 200 psi min 
? Grab Tensile Elongation (ASTM D4632) 30% max 
? Mullen Burst Strength (ASTM D3786-80a) 400 psi min 
? AOS (ASTM D4751) 20-45 (U.S. standard sieve size) 
¦ Consider early installation of the first lift of asphalt in areas that will be paved; this can be used as a stabilized entrance. Also consider the installation of excess concrete as a stabilized entrance. During large concrete pours, excess concrete is often available for this purpose 
¦ Hog fuel (wood-based mulch) may be substituted for or combined with quarry spalls in areas that will not be used for permanent roads. Hog fuel is generally less effective at stabilizing construction entrances and should be used only at sites where the amount of traffic is very limited. Hog fuel is not recommended for entrance stabilization in urban areas. The effectiveness of hog fuel is highly variable and it generally requires more maintenance than quarry spalls. The inspector may at any time require the use of quarry spalls if the hog fuel is not preventing sediment from being tracked onto pavement or if the hog fuel is being carried onto pavement. Hog fuel is prohibited in permanent roadbeds because organics in the subgrade soils cause degradation of the subgrade support over time 
¦ Fencing (see BMP EC-4) shall be installed as necessary to restrict traffic to the construction entrance 
¦ Whenever possible, the entrance shall be constructed on a firm, compacted subgrade. This can substantially increase the effectiveness of the pad and reduce the need for maintenance 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Quarry spalls (or hog fuel) shall be added if the pad is no longer in accordance with the specifications 
¦ If the entrance is not preventing sediment from being tracked onto pavement, then alternative measures to keep the streets free of sediment shall be used. This may include street sweeping, an increase in the dimensions of the entrance, or the installation of a wheel wash 
¦ Any sediment that is tracked onto pavement shall be removed by shoveling or street sweeping. The sediment collected by sweeping shall be removed or stabilized on site. The pavement shall not be cleaned by washing down the street, except when sweeping is ineffective and there is a threat to public safety. If it is necessary to wash the streets, the construction of a small sump shall be considered. The sediment would then be washed into the sump where it can be controlled 
¦ Any quarry spalls that are loosened from the pad, which end up on the roadway shall be removed immediately 
¦ If vehicles are entering or exiting the site at points other than the construction entrance(s), fencing (see BMP EC-4) shall be installed to control traffic 
¦ Upon project completion and site stabilization, all construction accesses intended as permanent access for maintenance shall be permanently stabilized 
    Inspection and Maintenance. 
¦ Inspect and verify that activity-based BMPs are in place prior to the commencement of associated activities. While activities associated with the BMPs are under way, inspect weekly during the rainy season and at two-week intervals in the non-rainy season to verify continued BMP implementation 
¦ Inspect local roads adjacent to the site daily. Sweep or vacuum to remove visible accumulated sediment 
¦ Remove quarry spalls, separate and dispose of sediment if construction entrance/exit is clogged with sediment 
¦ Keep all temporary roadway ditches clear 
¦ Check for damage and repair as needed 
¦ Remove all sediment deposited on paved roadways within 24 hours 
¦ Remove stabilized construction entrance at completion of construction

2.  BMP SC-2: Wheel Wash. 
    Purpose. Wheel washes reduce the amount of sediment transported onto paved roads by motor vehicles. 
    Conditions of Use. When a stabilized construction entrance (see SC-1) is not preventing sediment from being tracked onto pavement. 
¦ Wheel washing is generally an effective BMP when installed with careful attention to topography. For example, a wheel wash can be detrimental if installed at the top of a slope abutting a right-of-way where the water from the dripping truck can run unimpeded into the street 
¦ Pressure washing combined with an adequately sized and surfaced pad with direct drainage to a large 10-foot x 10-foot sump can be very effective 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Suggested details are shown in Figure SC-2-1 
¦ A minimum of 6 inches of asphalt treated base (ATB) over crushed base material or 8 inches over a good subgrade is recommended to pave the wheel wash. Use a low clearance truck to test the wheel wash before paving. Either a belly dump or lowboy will work well to test clearance 
¦ Keep the water level from 12 to 14 inches deep to avoid damage to truck hubs and filling the truck tongues with water 
¦ Midpoint spray nozzles are only needed in extremely muddy conditions 
¦ Wheel wash systems should be designed with a small grade change, 6 to 12 inches for a 10-foot-wide pond, to allow sediment to flow to the low side of pond to help prevent re-suspension of sediment 
¦ A drainpipe with a 2- to 3-foot riser should be installed on the low side of the pond to allow for easy cleaning and refilling 
¦ Polymers may be used to promote coagulation and flocculation in a closed-loop system. Polyacrylamide (PAM) added to the wheel wash water at a rate of 0.25 - 0.5 pounds per 1,000 gallons of water increases effectiveness and reduces cleanup time. If PAM is already being used for dust or erosion control and is being applied by a water truck, the same truck can be used to change the wash water 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ The wheel wash should start out the day with fresh water 
¦ The wash water should be changed a minimum of once per day. On large earthwork jobs where more than 10-20 trucks per hour are expected, the wash water will need to be changed more often 
¦ Wheel wash or tire bath wastewater shall be discharged to a separate on-site treatment system, such as closed-loop recirculation or land application, or to the sanitary sewer with proper approval

3.  BMP SC-3: Straw Bale Barrier. 
    Purpose. To decrease the velocity of sheet flows and intercept and detain small amounts of sediment from disturbed areas of limited extent, preventing sediment from leaving the site. See Figure SC-3-1 for details on straw bale barriers. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Below disturbed areas subject to sheet and rill erosion 
¦ Straw bales are among the most used and least effective BMPs. The best use of a straw bale is hand spread on the site 
¦ Where the size of the drainage area is no greater than 1/4 acre per 100 feet of barrier length; the maximum slope length behind the barrier is 100 feet; and the maximum slope gradient behind the barrier is 2:1 
¦ Where effectiveness is required for less than three months 
¦ Under no circumstances should straw bale barriers be constructed in streams, channels, or ditches 
¦ Straw bale barriers should not be used where rock or hard surfaces prevent the full and uniform anchoring of the barrier 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Bales shall be placed in a single row, lengthwise on the contour, with ends of adjacent bales tightly abutting one another 
¦ All bales shall be either wire-bound or string-tied. Straw bales shall be installed so that bindings are oriented around the sides rather than along the tops and bottoms of the bales in order to prevent deterioration of the bindings 
¦ The barrier shall be entrenched and backfilled. A trench shall be excavated the width of a bale and the length of the proposed barrier to a minimum depth of 4 inches. The trench must be deep enough to remove all grass and other material that might allow underflow. After the bales are staked and chinked (filled by wedging), the excavated soil shall be backfilled against the barrier. Backfill soil shall conform to the ground level on the downhill side and shall be built up to 4 inches against the uphill side of the barrier 
¦ Each bale shall be securely anchored by at least two stakes or re-bars driven through the bale. The first stake in each bale shall be driven toward the previously laid bale to force the bales together. Stakes or re-bars shall be driven deep enough into the ground to securely anchor the bales. Stakes should not extend above the bales but instead should be driven in flush with the top of the bale for safety reasons 
¦ The gaps between the bales shall be chinked (filled by wedging) with straw to prevent water from escaping between the bales. Loose straw scattered over the area immediately uphill from a straw bale barrier tends to increase barrier efficiency. Wedging must be done carefully in order not to separate the bales 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Straw bale barriers shall be inspected immediately after each runoff producing rainfall and at least daily during prolonged rainfall 
¦ Close attention shall be paid to the repair of damaged bales, end runs, and undercutting beneath bales 
¦ Necessary repairs to barriers or replacement of bales shall be accomplished promptly 
¦ Sediment deposits should be removed after each runoff-producing storm event. They must be removed when the level of deposition reaches approximately one-half the height of the barrier 
¦ Any sediment deposits remaining in place after the straw bale barrier is no longer required shall be dressed to conform to the existing grade, prepared and seeded 
¦ Straw bales used as a temporary straw bale barrier shall be removed after project completion and stabilization to prevent sprouting of unwanted vegetation

4.  BMP SC-4: Storm Drain Inlet Protection. 
    Purpose. To prevent coarse sediment from entering drainage systems prior to permanent stabilization of the disturbed area. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Where storm drain inlets are to be made operational before permanent stabilization of the disturbed drainage area 
¦ Protection should be provided for all storm drain inlets down slope and within 500 feet of a disturbed or construction area, unless the runoff that enters the catch basin will be conveyed to a sediment pond or trap 
¦ Inlet protection may be used anywhere to protect the drainage system. It is likely that the drainage system will still require cleaning 
¦ All of the methods for storm drain inlet protection are prone to plugging and require a high frequency of maintenance 
¦ Drainage areas should be limited to 1 acre or less 
¦ Emergency overflows may be required where stormwater ponding would cause a hazard. If an emergency overflow is provided, additional end-of-pipe treatment may be required 
    Design and Installation Specifications. Excavated Drop Inlet Protection - An excavated impoundment around the storm drain. Sediment settles out of the stormwater prior to entering the storm drain. 
¦ Depth 1-2 ft as measured from the crest of the inlet structure 
¦ Side Slopes of excavation no steeper than 2:1 
¦ Minimum volume of excavation 35 cubic yards

¦ Install provisions for draining to prevent standing water problems 
¦ Clear the area of all debris 
¦ Grade the approach to the inlet uniformly 
¦ Drill weep holes into the side of the inlet 
¦ Protect weep holes with screen wire and washed aggregate 
¦ Seal weep holes when removing structure and stabilizing area 
¦ It may be necessary to build a temporary dike to the down slope side of the structure to prevent bypass flow 
    Block and Gravel Filter - A barrier formed around the storm drain inlet with standard concrete blocks and gravel. 
¦ Height 1 to 2 feet above inlet 
¦ Recess the first row 2 inches into the ground for stability 
¦ Support subsequent courses by placing a 2 × 4 through the block opening 
¦ Do not use mortar 
¦ Lay some blocks in the bottom row on their side for dewatering the pool 
¦ Place hardware cloth or comparable wire mesh with 1/2-inch openings over all block openings 
¦ Place gravel just below the top of blocks on slopes of 2:1 or flatter 
¦ An alternative design is a gravel donut 
¦ Inlet slope of 3:1 
¦ Outlet slope of 2:1 
¦ 1-foot wide level stone area between the structure and the inlet 
¦ Inlet slope use stones 3 inches in diameter or larger 
¦ Outlet slope use gravel 1/2- to 3/4-inch at a minimum thickness of 1-foot 
    Gravel and Wire Mesh Filter - A gravel barrier placed over the top of the inlet. This structure does not provide an overflow. 
¦ Hardware cloth or comparable wire mesh with 1/2-inch openings 
¦ Coarse aggregate 
¦ Height 1-foot or more, 18 inches wider than inlet on all sides 
¦ Place wire mesh over the drop inlet so that the wire extends a minimum of 1-foot beyond each side of the inlet structure 
¦ If more than one strip of mesh is necessary, overlap the strips 
¦ Place coarse aggregate over the wire mesh 
¦ The depth of the gravel should be at least 12 inches over the entire inlet opening and extend at least 18 inches on all sides 
    Catch basin Filters - Inserts should be designed by the manufacturer for use at construction sites. The limited sediment storage capacity increases the amount of inspection and maintenance required, which may be daily for heavy sediment loads. The maintenance requirements can be reduced by combining a catch basin filter with another type of inlet protection. This type of inlet protection provides flow bypass without overflow and therefore may be a better method for inlets located along active rights-of-way. 
¦ 5 cubic feet of storage 
¦ Dewatering provisions 
¦ High-flow bypass that will not clog under normal use at a construction site 
¦ The catch basin filter is inserted in the catch basin just below the grating 
    Curb Inlet Protection with Wooden Weir - Barrier formed around a curb inlet with a wooden frame and gravel. 
¦ Wire mesh with 1/2-inch openings 
¦ Extra strength filter cloth 
¦ Construct a frame 
¦ Attach the wire and filter fabric to the frame 
¦ Pile coarse washed aggregate against wire/fabric 
¦ Place weight on frame anchors 
    Block and Gravel Curb Inlet Protection - Barrier formed around an inlet with concrete blocks and gravel. 
¦ Wire mesh with 1/2-inch openings 
¦ Place two concrete blocks on their sides abutting the curb at either side of the inlet opening. These are spacer blocks 
¦ Place a 2 x 4 stud through the outer holes of each spacer block to align the front blocks 
¦ Place blocks on their sides across the front of the inlet and abutting the spacer blocks 
¦ Place wire mesh over the outside vertical face 
¦ Pile coarse aggregate against the wire to the top of the barrier 
    Curb and Gutter Sediment Barrier - Sandbag or rock berm (riprap and aggregate) 3 feet high and 3 feet wide in a horseshoe shape. 
¦ Construct a horseshoe shaped berm, faced with coarse aggregate if using riprap, 3 feet high and 3 feet wide, at least 2 feet from the inlet 
¦ Construct a horseshoe shaped sedimentation trap on the outside of the berm sized to sediment trap standards for protecting a culvert inlet 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Catch basin filters should be inspected frequently, especially after storm events. If the insert becomes clogged, it should be cleaned or replaced 
¦ For systems using stone filters: If the stone filter becomes clogged with sediment, the stones must be pulled away from the inlet and cleaned or replaced. Since cleaning of gravel at a construction site may be difficult, an alternative approach would be to use the clogged stone as fill and put fresh stone around the inlet 
¦ Do not wash sediment into storm drains while cleaning. Spread all excavated material evenly over the surrounding land area or stockpile and stabilize as appropriate

5.  BMP SC-5: Sandbag Curb Inlet Sediment Barrier. 
    Purpose. Sandbag curb inlet barriers are temporary sediment barriers consisting of sandbags placed on the uphill side of the inlet and overlapping onto the curb. Curb inlet sediment barriers are used to prevent sediment from entering the storm drain system in paved areas. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Applicable to all construction sites where the roads are already paved with the curb inlets in place 
¦ The sandbag barriers are useful on streets which receive runoff flows of less than 0.5 cubic feet per second (cfs) for the ten year, 24 hour design storm 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ The sandbag curb inlet sediment barriers are for drainage areas of less than 1 acre 
¦ Sandbag curb inlet sediment barriers are designed to keep sediment out of the storm drain system when the roads are already paved 
¦ A small area of sediment storage should be provided behind the sandbags 
¦ The sandbag should be of plastic woven material rather than burlap. Burlap bags rot and deteriorate, and as a result, can cause more problems if broken 
¦ Clean washed sand should be used to fill the bags 
¦ The sandbags should be placed in a curved row from the top of the curb to at least 3 feet into the street 
¦ The row should be at least 6 feet from the inlet and curved at the ends, which should be pointing uphill 
¦ Several layers of bags should be overlapped and packed tightly together in order to eliminate any spaces between the bags 
¦ Leave a 6-inch gap in the middle of the top row of sandbags to serve as the spillway 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Sandbags exposed to sunlight will need to be replaced every two to three months due to degradation of the bags 
¦ Reshape and replace sandbags as needed 
¦ Repair washouts or other damage as needed 
¦ Accumulated sediment should be removed and placed where it will not enter the storm drain. Sediment should be removed when the sediment accumulation reaches one-third of the barrier height. Sediment removed during maintenance may be incorporated into earthwork on the site or disposed at an appropriate location 
¦ Additional sediment storage capacity can be obtained by constructing a series of sand bag barriers along the curb and gutter so that each barrier traps a small amount of sediment 
¦ Remove sandbags when no longer needed. Remove sediment accumulation, and clean, regrade and stabilize the area

6.  BMP SC-6: Filter Strips. 
    Purpose. Filter strips, also known as vegetated strips, are strips of close growing vegetation located to receive runoff from diffuse sources, waterways, drains, and intermittent streams before the water enters a stream, or drainage pond. Filter strips reduce the transport of coarse sediment from a construction site by providing a temporary physical barrier to sediment and reducing the runoff velocities of overland flow. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Applies to all land uses where topography, soils, and moisture supplies are suitable for establishment of filter strips 
¦ The runoff water should be spread as it enters the filter strip either by natural topography or by installation of level spreader ditches 
¦ Use strips or areas of existing vegetation where possible 
¦ Width of the filter strip should be adequate to allow settlement of the sediments. The width will vary depending on slope, type of vegetation and quantity of anticipated runoff water 
¦ Vegetated strips may be used down slope of all disturbed areas 
¦ Vegetated strips are not intended to treat concentrated flows, nor are they intended to treat substantial amounts of overland flow. Any concentrated flows must be conveyed through the drainage system to a sediment pond. The only circumstance in which overland flow can be treated solely by a strip, rather than by a sediment pond, is when the following criteria are met: 
Contributory Overland Flow 
Average Slope Slope Percent Flow path Length 1.5H:1V or less 67% or less 100 feet 2H:1V or less 50% or less 115 feet 4H:1V or less 25% or less 150 feet 6H:1V or less 16.7% or less 200 feet 10H:1V or less 10% or less 250 feet  
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ The vegetated strip shall consist of a minimum of a 25-foot wide continuous strip of dense vegetation with a permeable topsoil. Grass covered, landscaped areas are generally not adequate because the volume of sediment overwhelms the grass. Ideally, vegetated strips shall consist of undisturbed native growth with a well-developed soil that allows for infiltration of runoff 
¦ The slope within the strip shall not exceed 4H:1V 
¦ The uphill boundary of the vegetated strip shall be delineated with clearing limits 
Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Any areas damaged by erosion or construction activity shall be seeded immediately and protected by mulch 
¦ If more than 5 feet of the original vegetated strip width has had vegetation removed or is being eroded, sod must be installed 
¦ If there are indications that concentrated flows are traveling across the buffer, surface water controls must be installed to reduce the flows entering the buffer, or additional perimeter protection must be installed 
7.  BMP SC-7: Silt Fence. 
    Purpose. Use of a silt fence reduces the transport of coarse sediment from a construction site by providing a temporary physical barrier to sediment and reducing the runoff velocities of overland flow. See Figure EC-7-1 for details on silt fence construction. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Silt fence may be used down slope of all disturbed areas 
¦ Silt fence is not intended to treat concentrated flows, nor is it intended to treat substantial amounts of overland flow. Any concentrated flows must be conveyed through the drainage system to a sediment pond or trap. The only circumstance in which overland flow can be treated solely by a silt fence, rather than by a sediment pond or trap, is when the area draining to the fence is one acre or less and 10 year, 24 hour flow rates are less than 0.5 cfs 
¦ Silt fences should not be constructed in streams or used in V-shaped ditches. They are not an adequate method of silt control for anything deeper than sheet or overland flow 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Drainage area of 1 acre or less or in combination with sediment basin in a larger site 
¦ Maximum slope steepness (normal (perpendicular) to fence line) 1:1 
¦ Maximum sheet or overland flow path length to the fence of 100 feet 
¦ No flows greater than 0.5 cfs for 10 year, 24 hour event 
¦ The geotextile used shall meet the following standards. All geotextile properties listed below are minimum average roll values (i.e., the test result for any sampled roll in a lot shall meet or exceed the values shown in the following table): 
Geotextile Standards 
Polymeric Mesh AOS 
(ASTM D4751) 0.60 mm maximum for slit film woven (#30 sieve). 0.30 mm maximum for all other geotextile types (#50 sieve). 0.15 mm minimum for all fabric types (#100 sieve). Water Permittivity 
(ASTM D4491) 0.02 sec-1 minimumGrab Tensile Strength (ASTM D4632) 180 lbs. Minimum for extra strength fabric. 100 lbs minimum for standard strength fabric. Grab Tensile Strength 
(ASTM D4632) 30% maximum Ultraviolet Resistance 
(ASTM D4355) 70% minimum  
¦ Standard strength fabrics shall be supported with wire mesh, chicken wire, 2-inch × 2-inch wire, safety fence, or jute mesh to increase the strength of the fabric. Silt fence materials are available that have synthetic mesh backing attached 
¦ Filter fabric material shall contain ultraviolet ray inhibitors and stabilizers to provide a minimum of six months of expected usable construction life at a temperature range of 0°F. to 120°F 
¦ 100 percent biodegradable silt fence is available that is strong, long lasting, and can be left in place after the project is completed, if permitted by local regulations 
¦ Standard Notes for construction plans and specifications follow 
? The contractor shall install and maintain temporary silt fences at the locations shown in the Plans. The silt fences shall be constructed in the areas of clearing, grading, or drainage prior to starting those activities. A silt fence shall not be considered temporary if the silt fence must function beyond the life of the contract. The silt fence shall prevent soil carried by runoff water from going beneath, through, or over the top of the silt fence, but shall allow the water to filter through the fence. 
? The minimum height of the top of silt fence shall be 2 feet and the maximum height shall be 21/2 feet above the original ground surface. 
? The geotextile shall be sewn together at the point of manufacture, or at an approved location as determined by the Engineer, to form geotextile lengths as required. All sewn seams shall be located at a support post. Alternatively, two sections of silt fence can be overlapped, provided the Contractor can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, that the overlap is long enough and that the adjacent fence sections are close enough together to prevent silt laden water from escaping through the fence at the overlap. 
? The geotextile shall be attached on the up-slope side of the posts and support system with staples, wire, or in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The geotextile shall be attached to the posts in a manner that reduces the potential for geotextile tearing at the staples, wire, or other connection device. Silt fence back-up support for the geotextile in the form of a wire or plastic mesh is dependent on the properties of the geotextile selected for use. If wire or plastic back-up mesh is used, the mesh shall be fastened securely to the up-slope of the posts with the geotextile being up-slope of the mesh back-up support. 
? The geotextile at the bottom of the fence shall be buried in a trench to a minimum depth of 4 inches below the ground surface. The trench shall be backfilled and the soil tamped in place over the buried portion of the geotextile, such that no flow can pass beneath the fence and scouring cannot occur. When wire or polymeric back-up support mesh is used, the wire or polymeric mesh shall extend into the trench a minimum of 3 inches. 
? The fence posts shall be placed or driven a minimum of 18 inches. A minimum depth of 12 inches is allowed if topsoil or other soft subgrade soil is not present and a minimum depth of 18 inches cannot be reached. Fence post depths shall be increased by 6 inches if the fence is located on slopes of 3:1 or steeper and the slope is perpendicular to the fence. If required post depths cannot be obtained, the posts shall be adequately secured by bracing or guying to prevent overturning of the fence due to sediment loading. 
? Silt fences shall be located on contour as much as possible, except at the ends of the fence, where the fence shall be turned uphill such that the silt fence captures the runoff water and prevents water from flowing around the end of the fence. 
? If the fence must cross contours, with the exception of the ends of the fence, gravel check dams placed perpendicular to the back of the fence shall be used to minimize concentrated flow and erosion along the back of the fence. The gravel check dams shall be approximately 1-foot deep at the back of the fence. It shall be continued perpendicular to the fence at the same elevation until the top of the check dam intercepts the ground surface behind the fence. The gravel check dams shall consist of crushed surfacing base course, gravel backfill for walls, or shoulder ballast. The gravel check dams shall be located every 10 feet along the fence where the fence must cross contours. The slope of the fence line where contours must be crossed shall not be steeper than 3:1. 
? Wood, steel or equivalent posts shall be used. Wood posts shall have minimum dimensions of 2 inches by 2 inches by 3 feet minimum length, and shall be free of defects such as knots, splits, or gouges. 
? Steel posts shall consist of either size No. 6 rebar or larger, ASTM A 120 steel pipe with a minimum diameter of 1-inch, U, T, L, or C shape steel posts with a minimum weight of 1.35 lbs./ft. or other steel posts having equivalent strength and bending resistance to the post sizes listed. The spacing of the support posts shall be a maximum of 6 feet. 
? Fence back-up support, if used, shall consist of steel wire with a maximum mesh spacing of 2 inches, or a prefabricated polymeric mesh. The strength of the wire or polymeric mesh shall be equivalent to or greater than 180 lbs. grab tensile strength. The polymeric mesh must be as resistant to ultraviolet radiation as the geotextile it supports. 
¦ Silt fence installation using the slicing method specification details follow. Refer to Figure EC-7-2 for slicing method details 
? The base of both end posts must be at least 2 to 4 inches above the top of the silt fence fabric on the middle posts for ditch checks to drain properly. Use a hand level or string level, if necessary, to mark base points before installation. 
? Install posts 3 to 4 feet apart in critical retention areas and 6 to 7 feet apart in standard applications. 
? Install posts 24 inches deep on the downstream side of the silt fence, and as close as possible to the fabric, enabling posts to support the fabric from upstream water pressure. 
? Install posts with the nipples facing away from the silt fence fabric. 
? Attach the fabric to each post with three ties, all spaced within the top 8 inches of the fabric. Attach each tie diagonally 45 degrees through the fabric, with each puncture at least one (1) inch vertically apart. In addition, each tie should be positioned to hang on a post nipple when tightening to prevent sagging. 
? Wrap approximately 6 inches of fabric around the end posts and secure with 3 ties. 
? No more than 24 inches of a 36-inch fabric is allowed above ground level. 
? The rope lock system must be used in all ditch check applications. 
? The installation should be checked and corrected for any deviation before compaction. Use a flat-bladed shovel to tuck fabric deeper into the ground if necessary. 
? Compaction is vitally important for effective results. Compact the soil immediately next to the silt fence fabric with the front wheel of the tractor, skid steer, or roller exerting at least 60 pounds per square inch. Compact the upstream side first and then each side twice for a total of four trips. 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Any damage shall be repaired immediately 
¦ If concentrated flows are evident uphill of the fence, they must be intercepted and conveyed to a sediment pond or trap 
¦ It is important to check the uphill side of the fence for signs of the fence clogging and acting as a barrier to flow and then causing channelization of flows parallel to the fence. If this occurs, replace the fence or remove the trapped sediment 
¦ Sediment deposits shall either be removed when the deposit reaches approximately one-third the height of the silt fence, or a second silt fence shall be installed 
¦ If the filter fabric (geotextile) has deteriorated due to ultraviolet breakdown, it shall be replaced

8.  BMP SC-8: Gravel Filter Berm. 
    Purpose. A gravel filter berm is constructed on rights-of-way or traffic areas within a construction site to capture and retain runoff from construction sites or roadways, to allow sediments to settle out, and to direct runoff water through filter berms at outlets to stabilize drainage ways. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Where a temporary measure is needed to retain sediment from rights-of-way or in traffic areas on construction sites 
¦ Applicable to relatively flat construction sites and should be installed on the down slope sides of the disturbed areas 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Berm material shall be 3/4 to 3 inches in size, washed well-graded gravel or crushed rock with less than 5 percent fines 
¦ Spacing of berms: 
o Every 300 feet on slopes less than 5 percent 
o Every 200 feet on slopes between 5 percent and 10 percent 
o Every 100 feet on slopes greater than 10 percent 
¦ Berm dimensions: 
o 1 foot high with 3:1 side slopes 
o 8 linear feet per 1 cfs runoff based on the 10-year, 24-hour design storm 
¦ Berm should be mounded along the contour of the slope at the downhill side of the construction site 
¦ The height of the ridge should be sufficient to contain the specified volume of runoff 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy seasons 
¦ Sediment that accumulates in the BMP shall be removed when the sediment height reaches one-third of the barrier height. Sediment removed during maintenance may be incorporated into earthwork on the site or disposed at an appropriate location. 
¦ Replace rock and filter material as needed 
9.  BMP SC-9: Gravel Bag Berm. 
    Purpose. A gravel bag berm is a series of gravel-filled bags placed on a level contour to intercept sheet flows. Gravel bags pond sheet flow runoff, allowing sediment to settle out, and release runoff slowly as sheet flows, preventing erosion. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Gravel Bag berms may be suitable: 
? As a linear sediment control measure 
? Below the toe of slopes and erodible slopes 
? As sediment traps at culvert/pipe outlets 
? Below other small cleared areas 
? Along the perimeter of a site 
? Down slope of exposed soil areas 
? Around temporary stockpiles and spoil areas 
? Parallel to a roadway to keep sediment off paved areas 
? Along streams and channels 
¦ As linear erosion control measure: 
? Along the face and at grade breaks of exposed and erodible slopes to shorten slope length and spread runoff as sheet flow 
? At the top of slopes to divert runoff away from disturbed slopes 
¦ As check dams across mildly sloped construction roads 
    Limitations. 
¦ Gravel bag berms may be difficult to remove 
¦ Removal problems limit their usefulness in landscaped areas 
¦ Gravel bag berms may not be appropriate for drainage areas greater than 5 acres 
¦ Runoff will pond upstream of the filter, possibly causing flooding if sufficient space does not exist 
¦ Degraded gravel bags may rupture when removed, spilling contents 
¦ Installation can be labor intensive 
¦ Berms may have limited durability for long-term projects 
¦ When used to detain concentrated flows, maintenance requirements increase 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Locate gravel bag berms on level contours. Slopes between 20:1 and 2:1 (H:V): Gravel bags should be placed at a maximum interval of 50 ft. with the first row near the slope toe. Slopes 2:1 (H:V) or steeper: Gravel bags should be placed at a maximum interval of 25 ft (a closer spacing is more effective), with the first row placed on slope toe 
¦ Turn the ends of the gravel bag barriers up slope to prevent runoff from going around the berm 
¦ Allow sufficient space up slope from the gravel bag berm to allow ponding, and to provide room for sediment storage 
¦ For installation near the toe of the slope, consider moving the gravel bag barriers away from the slope toe to facilitate cleaning. To prevent flows behind the barrier, bags can be placed perpendicular to a berm to serve as cross barriers 
¦ Drainage area should not exceed 5 acres 
¦ In Non-Traffic Areas: 
? Height = 18 in. maximum 
? Top width = 24 in. minimum for three or more layer construction 
? Top width = 12 in. minimum for one or two layer construction 
? Side slopes = 2:1 or flatter 
¦ In Construction Traffic Areas: 
? Height = 12 in. maximum 
? Top width = 24 in. minimum for three or more layer construction 
? Top width = 12 in. minimum for one or two layer construction 
? Side slopes = 2:1 or flatter 
¦ Butt ends of bags tightly: 
¦ On multiple rows, or multiple layer construction, overlap butt joints of adjacent row and row beneath 
¦ Use a pyramid approach when stacking bags 
¦ Bag Material: Bags should be woven polypropylene, polyethylene or polyamide fabric, minimum unit weight of 4 ounces/yd2, Mullen burst strength exceeding 300 lb/in2 in conformance with the requirements of ASTM designation D3786, and ultraviolet stability exceeding 70% in conformance with the requirements in ASTM designation D4355 
¦ Bag Size: Each gravel-filled bag should have a length of 18 in., width of 12 in., thickness of 3 in., and mass of approximately 33 lbs. Bag dimensions are nominal, and may vary based on locally available materials

10.  BMP SC-10: Interceptor Dike and Swale. 
    Purpose. Provide a ridge of compacted soil, or a ridge with an upslope swale, at the top or base of a disturbed slope or along the perimeter of a disturbed construction area to convey stormwater. Use the dike and/or swale to intercept the runoff from unprotected areas and direct it to areas where erosion can be controlled. This can prevent storm runoff from entering the work area or sediment-laden runoff from leaving the construction site. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Where the runoff from an exposed site or disturbed slope must be conveyed to an erosion control facility that can safely convey the stormwater 
¦ Locate upslope of a construction site to prevent runoff from entering disturbed area 
¦ When placed horizontally across a disturbed slope, it reduces the amount and velocity of runoff flowing down the slope 
¦ Locate down slope to collect runoff from a disturbed area and direct it to a sediment basin 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Dike and/or swale and channel must be stabilized with temporary or permanent vegetation or other channel protection during construction 
¦ Channel requires a positive grade for drainage, steeper grades require channel protection and check dams 
¦ Construct trench along the slope contour including a conveyance to outlet flow to a level spreader or other stabilized discharge

¦ Immediately remove sediment from the flow area 
¦ Damage caused by construction traffic or other activity must be repaired before the end of each working day 
¦ Check outlets and make timely repairs as needed to avoid gully formation. When the area below the temporary diversion dike is permanently stabilized, remove the dike and fill and stabilize the channel to blend with the natural surface 
11.  BMP SC-11: Brush Barrier. 
    Purpose. The purpose of brush barriers is to reduce the transport of coarse sediment from a construction site by providing a temporary physical barrier to sediment and reducing the runoff velocities of overland flow. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Brush barriers may be used down slope of all disturbed areas of less than one-quarter acre 
¦ Brush barriers are not intended to treat concentrated flows, nor are they intended to treat substantial amounts of overland flow. Any concentrated flows must be conveyed through the drainage system to a sediment pond or trap. The only circumstance in which overland flow can be treated solely by a barrier, rather than by a sediment pond or trap, is when the area draining to the barrier is small 
¦ Brush barriers should only be installed parallel to contours

12.  BMP SC-12: Willow Wattles. 
    Purpose. Wattling is a revegetation technique consisting of placing bundles of willow cuttings in shallow trenches, on the contour of either cut or fill slopes to stabilize cut or fill slopes, to stabilize the surface, to reduce the velocity of surface runoff, to trap sediment, to increase infiltration, and to establish vegetation. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Applicable to surface disturbances involving cut or fill slopes 
¦ Angle of repose is excessively steep 
¦ As a type of revegetation, wattling is applicable on moist site or seeped areas 
¦ Wattling is a valuable method to help achieve surface stability on a cut or fill slope, which is near its angle of repose, but continues to erode due to surface runoff 
¦ Wattling bundles can vegetatively root and sprout and continue to stabilize slope surfaces as a revegetation planting. Rooting and sprouting will occur if adequate moisture is available at the time of placement and the first growing season 
¦ Temporary irrigation can be very effective during establishment 
¦ The placement of the wattling bundles along the contours can reduce slope lengths, which can provide long, uninterrupted paths for surface runoff 
¦ The rows of wattling bundles act as small sediment traps and increases the amount of infiltration on site. Wattling should not be prescribed as a treatment on cut banks with shallow soils. The increased infiltration will saturate the subsoil and may lead to soil slippage and landslides 
    Design Criteria. The followings steps for preparing and placing the wattling bundles are recommended: 
¦ Wattling bundles should be prepared from living branches of willow (Salix spp.) within or near the project area. Willow is the ideal material because it sprouts and roots easily, branches are long, straight, and flexible. Wattling material can be cut with lopping shears, chain saws, or power brush cutting saws 
¦ Wattling bundles may vary length, depending on the material available. Bundles 5 feet long are the easiest to work with. Bundles shall taper at the ends and shall be 1 to 1/2 feet longer than the average length of stems used to achieve this taper. The butts of individual stems shall not vary more than one half inch in diameter 
¦ Stems shall be placed alternately (randomly) in each bundle so that approximately one-half of the butt ends are at each end of the bundle 
¦ When compressed firmly and tied, each bundle shall be approximately eight inches in diameter 
¦ Bundles shall be tied on not more than 15-inch centers with two warps of binder twine or heavier tying material with a nonslipping knot 
¦ Bundles shall be prepared in advance of placement and kept covered and wet. They may be prepared up to seven days in advance of placement 
¦ Grade for the wattling trenches shall be stakes with an Abney level, or similar device, and shall follow parallel to slope contours (horizontal) 
¦ Trenches shall be three feet vertical spacing (or such other spacing specified. Economics may dictate wider placement) 
¦ Bundles shall be laid in trenches dug to approximately one-half the diameter of the bundles, with ends of bundles overlapping at least 12 inches. The overlap shall be as long as necessary to permit staking as specified below 
¦ Bundles shall be staked firmly in place with vertical stakes on the downhill side of the wattling. Vertical stakes should be spaced not more than 18 inches on center and diagonal stakes through the bundles on not more than 20-inch centers. Where bundle overlap occurs between previously set bottom or guide stakes, an additional bottom stake shall be used on the midpoint of the overlap. Bundle overlaps shall be "tied" with a diagonal stake through the ends of both bundles 
¦ Stakes may be made of live wattling material greater than 1-1/2 inches in diameter or they may be construction stakes. Reinforcing bar may be substituted only as specified below 
¦ All stakes shall be driven to a firm hold and a minimum of 18 inches deep. Where soils are soft and 24-inch stakes are not solid (i.e. if they can be moved by hand), 36 inch stakes shall be used. Where soils are so compacted that 24 inch stakes cannot be driven 18 inches deep, 3/8 - 1/2 inch steel reinforcing bar shall be used for staking 
¦ Work shall progress from the bottom of the cut or fill toward the top and each row shall be covered with soil and packed firmly behind and on the uphill side of the wattling by tamping or by walking on the wattling as the work progresses or by a combination of these methods 
¦ The downhill "lip" of the wattling bundle shall be left exposed when staking and covering are completed. However, the preceding specifications must be rigorously adhered to 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Inspection and repair is especially important during the first year 
¦ Immediately replace or repair any stakes or bundles that have worked out of the ground 
¦ Immediately repair any slope sloughing or gully formed due to failure of the wattles

13.  BMP SC-13: Straw Wattles. 
    Purpose. Straw wattles are temporary erosion and sediment control barriers consisting of straw that is wrapped in biodegradable tubular plastic or similar encasing material. They reduce the velocity and can spread the flow of rill and sheet runoff, and can capture and retain sediment. Straw wattles are typically 8 to 10 inches in diameter and 25 to 30 feet in length. The wattles are placed in shallow trenches and staked along the contour of disturbed or newly constructed slopes. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Disturbed areas that require immediate erosion protection 
¦ Exposed soils during the period of short construction delays, or over winter months 
¦ On slopes requiring stabilization until permanent vegetation can be established 
¦ Straw wattles are effective for one to two seasons 
¦ If conditions are appropriate, wattles can be staked to the ground using willow cuttings for added revegetation 
¦ Rilling can occur beneath wattles if not properly entrenched and water can pass between wattles if not tightly abutted together 
    Design Criteria. 
¦ It is critical that wattles are installed perpendicular to the flow direction and parallel to the slope contour 
¦ Narrow trenches should be dug across the slope on contour to a depth of 3 to 5 inches on clay soils and soils with gradual slopes. On loose soils, steep slopes, and areas with high rainfall, the trenches should be dug to a depth of 5 to 7 inches, or 1/2 to 2/3 of the thickness of the wattle 
¦ Start building trenches and installing wattles from the base of the slope and work up. Excavated material should be spread evenly along the uphill slope and compacted using hand tamping or other methods 
¦ Construct trenches at contour intervals of 3 to 30 feet apart depending on the steepness of the slope, soil type, and rainfall. The steeper the slope the closer together the trenches 
¦ Install the wattles snugly into the trenches and abut tightly end to end. Do not overlap the ends 
¦ Install stakes at each end of the wattle, and at 4-foot centers along entire length of wattle 
¦ If required, install pilot holes for the stakes using a straight bar to drive holes through the wattle and into the soil 
¦ At a minimum, wooden stakes should be approximately 3/4 × 3/4 × 24 inches. Willow cuttings or 3/8 -inch rebar can also be used for stakes 
¦ Stakes should be driven through the middle of the wattle, leaving 2 to 3 inches of the stake protruding above the wattle 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Wattles may require maintenance to ensure they are in contact with soil and thoroughly entrenched, especially after significant rainfall on steep sandy soils 
¦ Inspect the slope after significant storms and repair any areas where wattles are not tightly abutted or water has scoured beneath the wattles

14.  BMP SC-14: Sediment Trap. 
    Purpose. A sediment trap is a small temporary ponding area with a gravel outlet used to collect and store sediment from sites cleared and/or graded during construction. Sediment traps, along with other perimeter controls, shall be installed before any land disturbance takes place in the drainage area. 
    Conditions of Use. Prior to leaving a construction site, stormwater runoff must pass through a sediment pond or trap or other appropriate sediment removal best management practice. Non-engineered sediment traps may be used on-site prior to an engineered sediment trap or sediment pond to provide additional sediment removal capacity. 
    It is intended for use on sites where the tributary drainage area is less than 3 acres, with no unusual drainage features, and a projected build-out time of six months or less. The sediment trap is a temporary measure (with a design life of approximately 6 months) and shall be maintained until the site area is permanently protected against erosion by vegetation and/or structures. 
    Sediment traps and ponds are only effective in removing sediment down to about the medium silt size fraction. Runoff with sediment of finer grades (fine silt and clay) will pass through untreated, emphasizing the need to control erosion to the maximum extent first. 
    Whenever possible, sediment-laden water shall be discharged into onsite, relatively level, vegetated areas (see BMP SC-6 - Filter Strip). This is the only way to effectively remove fine particles from runoff unless chemical treatment or filtration is used. This can be particularly useful after initial treatment in a sediment trap or pond. The areas of release must be evaluated on a site-by-site basis in order to determine appropriate locations for and methods of releasing runoff. Vegetated wetlands shall not be used for this purpose. Frequently, it may be possible to pump water from the collection point at the downhill end of the site to an upslope vegetated area. Pumping shall only augment the treatment system, not replace it, because of the possibility of pump failure or runoff volume in excess of pump capacity. 
    All projects that are constructing permanent facilities for runoff quantity control should use the rough-graded or final-graded permanent facilities for traps and ponds. This includes combined facilities and infiltration facilities. When permanent facilities are used as temporary sedimentation facilities, the surface area requirement of a sediment trap or pond must be met. If the surface area requirements are larger than the surface area of the permanent facility, then the trap or pond shall be enlarged to comply with the surface area requirement. The permanent pond shall also be divided into two cells as required for sediment ponds. If permanent infiltration facilities are used for temporary sediment traps, the bottom of the trap must be kept at least two feet higher that the bottom elevation of the permanent facility. This will provide a vertical buffer to prevent sediment from plugging the native soils to be used for permanent infiltration. The permanent facility will be excavated to final depth once the site has been stabilized and the temporary trap is no longer necessary. 
    Either a permanent control structure or the temporary control structure (described in BMP SC-15, Temporary Sediment Pond) can be used. If a permanent control structure is used, it may be advisable to partially restrict the lower orifice with gravel to increase residence time while still allowing dewatering of the pond. A shut-off valve may be added to the control structure to allow complete retention of stormwater in emergency situations. In this case, an emergency overflow weir must be added. 
    A skimmer may be used for the sediment trap outlet if approved by Carson City. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ See Figures SC-14-1 and SC-14-2 for details 
¦ If permanent runoff control facilities are part of the project, they should be used for sediment retention 
¦ To determine the sediment trap geometry, first calculate the design surface area (SA) of the trap, measured at the invert of the weir. Use the following equation: 
SA = FS(Q 2 /Vs) 
where 
Q 2 =  Design inflow based on the peak discharge from the developed 2-year, 24 hour runoff event from the contributing drainage area as computed in the hydrologic analysis. The 10-year peak flow shall be used if the project size, expected timing and duration of construction, or downstream conditions warrant a higher level of protection. If no hydrologic analysis is required, the Rational Method may be used 
Vs =  The settling velocity of the soil particle of interest. The 0.02 mm (medium silt) particle with an assumed density of 2.65 g/cm3 has been selected as the particle of interest and has a settling velocity (Vs) of 0.00096 ft/sec 
FS =  A safety factor of 2 to account for non-ideal settling 
Therefore, the equation for computing surface area becomes: 
SA = 2 × Q 2 / 0.00096 or 
2080 square feet per cfs of inflow 
    Note: Even if permanent facilities are used, they must still have a surface area that is at least as large as that derived from the above formula. If they do not, the pond must be enlarged. 
¦ To aid in determining sediment depth, all sediment traps shall have a staff gauge with a prominent mark 1-foot above the bottom of the trap 
¦ Sediment traps may not be feasible on utility projects due to the limited workspace or the short-term nature of the work. Portable tanks may be used in place of sediment traps for utility projects 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at 2-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Sediment shall be removed from the trap when it reaches 1-foot in depth 
¦ Any damage to the pond embankments or slopes shall be repaired

15.  BMP SC-15: Temporary Sediment Pond. 
    Purpose. Sediment ponds remove sediment from runoff originating from disturbed areas of the site. Sediment ponds are typically designed to remove sediment no smaller than medium silt (0.02 mm). Consequently, they usually reduce turbidity only slightly. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Prior to leaving a construction site, stormwater runoff must pass through a sediment pond or other appropriate sediment removal best management practice. 
¦ A sediment pond shall be used where the contributing drainage area is 3 acres or more. Ponds must be used in conjunction with erosion control practices to reduce the amount of sediment flowing into the basin. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Sediment basins must be installed only on sites where failure of the structure would not result in loss of life, damage to homes or buildings, or interruption of use or service of public roads or utilities. Also, sediment traps and ponds are attractive to children and can be very dangerous. Compliance with local ordinances regarding health and safety must be addressed. If fencing of the pond is required, the type of fence and its location shall be shown on the ESC plan 
¦ Structures having a maximum height of 20 feet, and/or a maximum storage capacity of 20 acre-feet or larger are subject to dam safety regulations. Smaller impoundments may also be subject to dam safety regulations if they are determined to be "high-hazard" based on potential downstream impacts as determined by the Nevada Department of Water Resources 
¦ See Figure SC-15-1, Figure SC-15-2, and Figure SC-15-3 for details 
¦ If permanent runoff control facilities are part of the project, they should be used for sediment retention. The surface area requirements of the sediment basin must be met. This may require enlarging the permanent basin to comply with the surface area requirements. If a permanent control structure is used, it may be advisable to partially restrict the lower orifice with gravel to increase residence time while still allowing dewatering of the basin 
¦ Use of infiltration facilities for sedimentation basins during construction tends to clog the soils and reduce their capacity to infiltrate. If infiltration facilities are to be used, the sides and bottom of the facility must only be rough excavated to a minimum of 2 feet above final grade. Final grading of the infiltration facility shall occur only when all contributing drainage areas are fully stabilized. The infiltration pretreatment facility should be fully constructed and used with the sedimentation basin to help prevent clogging 
¦ Determining Pond Geometry 
¦ Obtain the discharge from the hydrologic calculations of the peak flow for the 2-year, 24 hour runoff event ( Q 2 ). The 10-year peak flow shall be used if the project size, expected timing and duration of construction, or downstream conditions warrant a higher level of protection. If no hydrologic analysis is required, the Rational Method may be used 
    Determine the required surface area at the top of the riser pipe with the equation: 
¦ To determine the sediment trap geometry, first calculate the design surface area ( SA ) of the trap, measured at the invert of the weir. Use the following equation: 
SA = FS(Q 2 /Vs) 
where 
Q 2 =  Design inflow based on the peak discharge from the developed 2-year, 24 hour runoff event from the contributing drainage area as computed in the hydrologic analysis. The 10-year peak flow shall be used if the project size, expected timing and duration of construction, or downstream conditions warrant a higher level of protection. If no hydrologic analysis is required, the Rational Method may be used 
Vs =  The settling velocity of the soil particle of interest. The 0.02 mm (medium silt) particle with an assumed density of 2.65 g/cm3 has been selected as the particle of interest and has a settling velocity ( Vs ) of 0.00096 ft/sec 
FS =  A safety factor of 2 to account for non-ideal settling 
Therefore, the equation for computing surface area becomes: 
SA = 2 × Q 2 /0.00096 or 
2080 square feet per cfs of inflow 
    Note: Even if permanent facilities are used, they must still have a surface area that is at least as large as that derived from the above formula. If they do not, the pond must be enlarged. 
    The basic geometry of the pond can now be determined using the following design criteria: 
? Required surface area SA (from above) at top of riser 
? Minimum 3.5-foot depth from top of riser to bottom of pond 
? Maximum 3:1 interior side slopes and maximum 2:1 exterior slopes. The interior slopes can be increased to a maximum of 2:1 if 6 foot high chain-link fencing is provided at or above the maximum water surface 
? One foot of freeboard between the top of the riser and the crest of the emergency spillway 
? Flat bottom 
? Minimum 1-foot deep spillway 
? Length-to-width ratio between 3:1 and 6:1 
¦ Sizing of Discharge Mechanisms. The outlet for the basin consists of a combination of principal and emergency spillways. These outlets must pass the peak runoff expected from the contributing drainage area for a 100-year storm, 24 hour design. If, due to site conditions and basin geometry, a separate emergency spillway is not feasible, the principal spillway must pass the entire peak runoff expected from the 100-year storm. However, an attempt to provide a separate emergency spillway should always be made. The runoff calculations should be based on the site conditions producing the maximum amount of runoff, which is typically the developed paved condition, but could also be the rough graded condition if the developed site incorporates significant landscaping. The flow through the dewatering orifice cannot be utilized when calculating the 100-year storm elevation because of its potential to become clogged; therefore, available spillway storage must begin at the principal spillway riser crest. 
 The principal spillway designed by the procedures contained in this standard will result in some reduction in the peak rate of runoff. However, if the basin for a permanent stormwater detention pond is used for a temporary sedimentation basin, the control structure for the permanent pond can be used to maintain predevelopment discharge limitations. The size of the basin, the expected life of the construction project, the anticipated downstream effects and the anticipated weather conditions during construction, should be considered to determine the need of additional discharge control. See Figure SC-15-4 for riser inflow curves. 
 Principal Spillway: Determine the required diameter for the principal spillway (riser pipe). The diameter shall be the minimum necessary to pass the pre-developed 10-year, 24 hour peak flow (Q 10 ). Use Figure SC-15-4 to determine this diameter (h = 1-foot). 
 Note: A permanent control structure may be used instead of a temporary riser. 
 Emergency Overflow Spillway: Determine the required size and design of the emergency overflow spillway for the developed 100-year, 24 hour peak flow using the method contained in Division 14. 
 Dewatering Orifice: Determine the size of the dewatering orifice(s) (minimum 1-inch diameter) using a modified version of the discharge equation for a vertical orifice and a basic equation for the area of a circular orifice. Determine the required area of the orifice with the following equation: 

where A o = orifice area (square feet) 
As = pond surface area (square feet) 
h = head of water above orifice (height of riser in feet) 
T = dewatering time (24 hours) 
g = acceleration of gravity (32.2 feet/second2) 

Convert the required orifice area to the required diameter D of the orifice: 

Where D = orifice diameter (inches) 
 The vertical, perforated tubing connected to the dewatering orifice must be at least 2 inches larger in diameter than the orifice to improve flow characteristics. The size and number of perforations in the tubing should be large enough so that the tubing does not restrict flow. The orifice should control the flow rate. 
¦ Additional Design Specifications. 
 The pond shall be divided into two roughly equal volume cells by a permeable divider that will reduce turbulence while allowing movement of water between cells. The divider shall be at least one half the height of the riser and a minimum of one foot below the top of the riser. Wire-backed, 2- to 3-foot high, extra strength filter fabric supported by treated 4"x4"s can be used as a divider. Alternatively, staked straw bales wrapped with filter fabric (geotextile) may be used. If the pond is more than 6 feet deep, a different mechanism must be proposed. A riprap embankment is one acceptable method of separation for deeper ponds. Other designs that satisfy the intent of this provision are allowed as long as the divider is permeable, structurally sound, and designed to prevent erosion under or around the barrier. 
 To aid in determining sediment depth, one-foot intervals shall be prominently marked on the riser. 
 If an embankment of more than 6 feet is proposed, the pond must comply with dam safety regulations per Nevada Department of Water Resources, and must be designed based on recommendation from a qualified geotechnical engineer. 
¦ The most common structural failure of sedimentation basins is caused by piping. Piping refers to two phenomena: (1) water seeping through fine-grained soil, eroding the soil grain by grain and forming pipes or tunnels; and, (2) water under pressure flowing upward through a granular soil with a head of sufficient magnitude to cause soil grains to lose contact and capability for support. 
 The most critical construction sequences to prevent piping will be: 
 1. Tight connections between riser and barrel and other pipe connections; 
 2. Adequate anchoring of riser; 
 3. Proper soil compaction of the embankment and riser footing; 
 4. Proper construction of anti-seep devices. 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Inspect BMPs prior to forecast rain, daily during extended rain events, after rain events, weekly during the rainy season, and at two-week intervals during the non-rainy season 
¦ Sediment shall be removed from the pond when it reaches 1-foot in depth 
¦ Any damage to the pond embankments or slopes shall be promptly repaired

16.  BMP SC-16: Construction Stormwater Filtration. 
    Purpose. Filtration removes sediment from runoff originating from disturbed areas of the site. 
    Conditions of Use. Traditional BMPs used to control soil erosion and sediment loss from sites under development may not be adequate to ensure compliance with the water quality standard for turbidity in the receiving water. Filtration may be used in conjunction with gravity settling to remove sediment as small as fine silt (0.5 m). The reduction in turbidity will be dependent on the particle size distribution of the sediment in the stormwater. In some circumstances, sedimentation and filtration may achieve compliance with the water quality standard for turbidity. Filtration may also be used in conjunction with polymer treatment in a portable system to assure capture of the flocculated solids. 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
    Background Information. Filtration with sand media has been used for over a century to treat water and wastewater. The use of sand filtration for treatment of stormwater has developed recently, generally to treat runoff from streets, parking lots, and residential areas. The application of filtration to construction stormwater treatment is currently under development. 
    2 types of filtration systems may be applied to construction stormwater treatment: rapid and slow. Rapid sand filters are the typical system used for water and wastewater treatment. They can achieve relatively high hydraulic flow rates, on the order of 2 to 20 gpm/sf, because they have automatic backwash systems to remove accumulated solids. In contrast, slow sand filters have very low hydraulic rates, on the order of 0.02 gpm/sf, because they do not have backwash systems. To date, slow sand filtration has generally been used to treat stormwater. Slow sand filtration is mechanically simple in comparison to rapid sand filtration but requires a much larger filter area. 
    Filtration Equipment. Sand media filters are available with automatic backwashing features that can filter to 50 m particle size. Screen or bag filters can filter down to 5 m. Fiber wound filters can remove particles down to 0.5 m. Filters should be sequenced from the largest to the smallest pore opening. Sediment removal efficiency will be related to particle size distribution in the stormwater. 
    Treatment Process Description. Stormwater is collected at interception point(s) on the site and is diverted to a sediment pond or tank for removal of large sediment and storage of the stormwater before it is treated by the filtration system. The stormwater is pumped from the trap, pond, or tank through the filtration system in a rapid sand filtration system. Slow sand filtration systems are designed as flow through systems using gravity. 
    If large volumes of concrete are being poured, pH adjustment may be necessary. 
    Maintenance Standards. 
¦ Rapid sand filters typically have automatic backwash systems that are triggered by a pre-set pressure drop across the filter. If the backwash water volume is not large or substantially more turbid than the stormwater stored in the holding pond or tank, backwash return to the pond or tank may be appropriate. However, land application or another means of treatment and disposal may be necessary 
¦ Screen, bag, and fiber filters must be cleaned and/or replaced when they become clogged 
¦ Sediment shall be removed from the storage and/or treatment ponds as necessary Typically, sediment removal is required once or twice during a wet season and at the decommissioning of the ponds 
C.  Management Source Control BMPs. 
1.  BMP MC-1: Concrete Handling. 
    Purpose. Concrete work can generate process water and slurry that contain fine particles and high pH, both of which can violate water quality standards in the receiving water. This BMP is intended to minimize and eliminate concrete process water and slurry from entering waters of the State. 
    Conditions of Use. 
¦ Any time concrete is used, these management practices shall be utilized Concrete construction projects include, but are not limited to, the following: 
¦ Curbs 
¦ Sidewalks 
¦ Roads 
¦ Bridges 
¦ Foundations 
¦ Floors 
¦ Runways 
¦  
¦  
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Concrete truck chutes, pumps, and internals shall be washed out only into formed areas awaiting installation of concrete or asphalt 
¦ Unused concrete remaining in the truck and pump shall be returned to the originating batch plant for recycling 
¦ Hand tools including, but not limited to, screeds, shovels, rakes, floats, and trowels shall be washed off only into formed areas awaiting installation of concrete or asphalt 
¦ Equipment that cannot be easily moved, such as concrete pavers, shall only be washed in areas that do not directly drain to natural or constructed stormwater conveyances 
¦ Wash down from areas such as concrete aggregate driveways shall not drain directly to natural or constructed stormwater conveyances 
¦ When no formed areas are available, wash water and leftover product shall be contained in a lined container. Contained concrete shall be disposed of in a manner that does not violate groundwater or surface water quality standards 
¦  
¦  
    Maintenance Standards. Containers shall be checked for holes in the liner daily during concrete pours and repaired the same day. 
2.  BMP MC-2: Sawcutting and Surfacing Pollution Prevention. 
    Purpose. Saw cutting and surfacing operations generate slurry and process water that contain fine particles and high pH (concrete cutting), both of which can violate the water quality standards in the receiving water. This BMP is intended to minimize and eliminate process water and slurry from entering waters of the State. 
    Conditions of Use. Anytime saw cutting or surfacing operations take place, these management practices shall be utilized. Saw cutting and surfacing operations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
¦ Sawing 
¦ Coring 
¦ Grinding 
¦ Roughening 
¦ Hydro-demolition 
¦ Bridge and road surfacing 
    Design and Installation Specifications. 
¦ Slurry and cuttings shall be vacuumed during cutting and surfacing operations. 
¦ Slurry and cuttings shall not remain on permanent concrete or asphalt pavement overnight. 
¦ Slurry and cuttings shall not drain to any natural or constructed drainage conveyance. 
¦ Collected slurry and cuttings shall be disposed of in a manner that does not violate groundwater or surface water quality standards. 
¦ Process water that is generated during hydro-demolition, surface roughening or similar operations shall not drain to any natural or constructed drainage conveyance and shall be disposed of in a manner that does not violate groundwater or surface water quality standards. 
¦ Cleaning waste material and demolition debris shall be handled and disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of water. If the area is swept with a pick-up sweeper, the material must be hauled out of the area to an appropriate disposal site. 
    Maintenance Standards. Continually monitor operations to determine whether slurry, cuttings, or process water could enter waters of the State. If inspections show that a violation of water quality standards could occur, stop operations and immediately implement preventive measures such as berms, barriers, secondary containment, and vacuum trucks. 
3.  BMP MC-3: Materials Management. 
    Purpose. Discharge of materials other than stormwater and authorized non-stormwater discharges is prohibited from construction sites. Non-stormwater discharges that may be allowed include but are not limited to irrigation of vegetative erosion control measures and pipe flushing and testing. 
    Waste management and materials pollution control BMPs are source control BMPs that prevent pollution by limiting or reducing potential pollutants at their source before they come in contact with stormwater. These BMPs involve day-to-day operations of the construction site and include operations under the control of the contractor. These BMPs are also referred to as "good housekeeping practices" which involve keeping a clean, orderly construction site. Waste management consists of implementing procedural and structural BMPs for handling, storing, and disposing of wastes generated by a construction project to prevent the release of waste materials into storm water runoff or discharges through proper management of solid, sanitary, hazardous and equipment related wastes. 
    Implementation. 
    Stockpile Management. Protection of stockpiles is a year-round requirement. 
? Locate stockpiles away from stormwater flows, drainage courses and inlets 
? Use temporary berms, dikes, silt fences, sandbags, gravel bags or straw bale barriers to protect stockpiles from storm water runon and to prevent transport of storm water pollutants 
? Place bagged materials on pallets and under cover 
? Stockpiles should be covered or protected with plastic sheeting or soil stabilization measures during the rainy season 
? Repair or replace perimeter controls and covers as needed to keep them functioning properly 
    Solid Waste Management. Solid wastes include trees and shrubs removed during land clearing, demolition of existing structures (rubble), packaging materials, scrap or surplus building materials, and domestic wastes (beverage cans, coffee cups, paper bags, etc.). Certain construction wastes may not necessitate stringent drainage related control during the non-rainy season. 
? Select designated waste collection areas onsite 
? Use only watertight trash-hauling dumpsters onsite. Inspect dumpsters for leaks and repair any dumpster that is not watertight 
? Locate containers under cover or in a secondary containment 
? Collect site trash daily and remove as needed 
? Make sure toxic liquid waste (used oils, solvents, and paints) and chemicals (acids, pesticides, additives, curing compounds) are not disposed of in dumpsters designated for construction debris 
? Do not hose out dumpsters on the construction site. Leave dumpster cleaning to the trash hauling contractor 
? Arrange for regular waste collection before containers overflow 
? Storm water run-on should be prevented from contacting stored solid waste through the use of berms, dikes, or other temporary diversion structures or through the use of measures to elevate waste from site surfaces 
? Store solid waste away from drainage facilities and water courses 
    Material Delivery and Storage. Prevent, reduce, or eliminate the discharge of pollutants from material delivery and storage to the stormwater system or watercourses by minimizing the storage of hazardous materials onsite, storing materials in a designated area, installing secondary containment, conducting regular inspections, and training employees and subcontractors. 
? Construction site areas should be designated for material delivery and storage. Temporary storage areas should be located away from vehicular traffic, drainage facilities and watercourses but near the construction entrance if possible. 
? An up to date inventory of materials delivered and stored onsite should be kept. 
? Hazardous materials storage onsite should be minimized. Hazardous materials should be handled as infrequently as possible. 
? Do not store chemicals, drums, or bagged materials directly on the ground. Place these items on a pallet and, when possible, in secondary containment. 
? Through the rainy season, each temporary containment facility should be covered during non-working days, prior to, and during rain events. 
? Materials should be stored in their original containers and the original product labels should be maintained in place in a legible condition. Damaged or otherwise illegible labels should be replaced immediately. 
? A supply of spill clean up material should be kept near storage areas. 
    Vehicle and Equipment Fueling. Vehicle equipment fueling procedures and practices are designed to prevent fuel spills and leaks, and reduce or eliminate contamination of storm water. 
? Use offsite-fueling stations as much as possible. These businesses are better equipped to handle fuel and spills properly. Performing this work offsite can also be economical by eliminating the need for a separate fueling area at a site. 
? When fueling must take place onsite, designate an area away from drainage courses to be used. Fueling areas should be identified in the Construction SWPPP. 
? Dedicated fueling areas should be protected from storm water run-on and runoff, and should be located at least 50 ft away from downstream drainage facilities and watercourses. Fueling must be performed on level-grade areas. Protect fueling areas with berms and dikes to prevent run-on, runoff and to contain spills. 
? Nozzles use in vehicle and equipment fueling should be equipped with an automatic shutoff to control drips. Fueling operations should not be left unattended. 
? Do not top-off fuel tanks. 
? Train employees and subcontractors in proper fueling and cleanup procedures. 
? Drip pans or absorbent pads should be used during vehicle and equipment fueling, unless the fueling is performed over an impermeable surface in a dedicated fueling area. 
? Absorbent spill cleanup materials and spill kits should be available in fueling areas and on fueling trucks, and should be disposed of properly after use. 
    Vehicle and Equipment Cleaning. Cleaning BMPs eliminate or reduce the discharge of pollutants to stormwater from vehicle and equipment cleaning operations. 
? Contract with an offsite or mobile commercial washing business when possible. These businesses may be better equipped to handle and dispose of the wash waters properly. 
? Use phosphate-free, biodegradable soaps. Note, even phosphate-free biodegradable soaps have been shown to be toxic to fish before the soap degrades. 
? All vehicles and equipment that regularly enter and leave the construction site must be cleaned offsite. 
? Do not steam clean equipment on site. 
? When vehicle and equipment washing and cleaning must occur onsite, and the operation cannot be located within a structure or building equipped with appropriate disposal facilities, the outside cleaning area should be: 
¦ Located away from storm drain inlets, drainage facilities or watercourses 
¦ Paved with concrete or asphalt and bermed to contain wash waters and to prevent run-on and runoff 
¦ Configured with a sump to allow collection and disposal of wash water 
¦ Prevent discharge of wash waters to storm drains or watercourses, and 
¦ Used only when necessary 
    Inspection and Maintenance. 
¦ Inspect and verify that activity-based BMPs are in place prior to the commencement of associated activities. While activities associated with the BMP are under way, inspect weekly during the rainy season, within 48 hours after a storm event, and at two-week intervals in the non-rainy season to verify continued BMP implementation 
¦ Inspect BMPs subject to non-stormwater discharges daily while non-stormwater discharges occur 
¦ Monitor employees and subcontractors throughout the duration of the construction project to ensure appropriate practices are being implemented 
(Ord. 2006-28, Development Standards). 
    Appendix 1 
    Recommended Standard Notes for Erosion Control Plans. 
    Plans should also identify with phone numbers the person or firm responsible for the preparation of and maintenance of the erosion control plan. 
    Notes: 
    Approval of this erosion/sedimentation control (ESC) plan does not constitute an approval of permanent road or drainage design (e.g. size and location of roads, pipes, restrictors, channels, retention facilities, utilities, etc.). 
    The implementation of these ESC plans and the construction, maintenance, replacement, and upgrading of these ESC facilities is the responsibility of the applicant/contractor until all construction is completed and approved and vegetation/landscaping is established. 
    The boundaries of the clearing limits shown on this plan shall be clearly flagged in the field prior to construction. During the construction period, no disturbance beyond the flagged clearing limits shall be permitted. The flagging shall be maintained by the applicant/contractor for the duration of construction. 
    The ESC facilities shown on this plan must be constructed in conjunction with all clearing and grading activities, and in such a manner as to ensure that sediment and sediment laden water do not enter the drainage system, roadways, or violate applicable water quality standards. 
    The ESC facilities shown on this plan are the minimum requirements for anticipated site conditions. During the construction period, these ESC facilities shall be upgraded as needed for unexpected storm events and to ensure that sediment and sediment-laden water do not leave the site. 
    The ESC facilities on active sites shall be inspected daily by the applicant/contractor and maintained as necessary to ensure their continued functioning. 
    The ESC facilities on inactive sites shall be inspected and maintained a minimum of once a month or within 48 hours following a major storm event. 
    At no time shall more than one foot of sediment be allowed to accumulate within a trapped catch basin. All catch basins and conveyance lines shall be cleaned prior to paving. The cleaning operation shall not flush sediment-laden water into the downstream system. 
    Stabilized construction entrances shall be installed at the beginning of construction and maintained for the duration of the project. Additional measures may be required to ensure that all paved areas are kept clean for the duration of the project. 
Division 14 - STORM DRAINAGE 
Sections: 

14.1 - Drainage policy introduction and basic principles. 
    Adequate drainage systems shall be provided in order to preserve and promote the general health, welfare, and economic well being of the region. Drainage is a regional feature that affects all of Carson City. Drainage plans shall be consistent with and integrated with the Carson City drainage master plan upon adoption. This characteristic of drainage requires coordination and cooperation from both the public and private sectors. 
    Storm water drainage systems are an integral part of the development process. The planning of drainage facilities shall be included in the development process and in preparation of improvement plans. 
    Drainage systems require space to accommodate conveyance and storage functions. When the space requirements are considered, the provision for adequate drainage becomes a competing use for space along with other land uses. 
    Storm drainage planning for all development shall include the allocation of space for drainage facility construction and maintenance, which may entail the dedication of right-of-way and/or easements. The provision of multi-use facilities such as combining with parks, open space, and recreation needs is strongly encouraged. 
14.1.1  Water Rights. All drainage systems shall be planned and constructed with consideration given to the existing water rights and applicable water laws. 
14.1.2  Reasonable Use of Drainage. Downstream properties shall not be unreasonably burdened with increased flow rates, negative impacts, or unreasonable changes in manner of flow from upstream properties. Drainage problems shall not be transferred from one location to another. However, downstream properties cannot block natural or existing runoff through their site and shall accept runoff from upstream properties. 
    "Reasonable use of drainage" is defined for planning purposes, as providing an economic and hydraulically efficient drainage system which is demonstrated not to adversely and unreasonably impact downstream properties within reason. This "reasonable use of drainage" therefore allows development to occur while preserving the rights of adjacent property owners. 
14.1.3  Change in Manner of Flow. Development shall tend to concentrate existing natural sheet flow into point flows at property lines. These point flows are generally associated with outlets from gutter flow, storm drains, and detention facilities. Downstream properties may experience a longer duration of storm flows, and greater flows in general due to a shortened time of concentration. Discharge of point flows on downstream property can cause increased erosion at the discharge point and further downstream. Therefore, downstream facilities shall be evaluated for runoff capacity during the design and review process. Mitigation of these point flows can be accomplished through energy dissipaters or flow spreaders. Point flows shall be discharged to downstream properties at non-erosive velocities and depths of flow. 
14.1.4  Diversion of Drainage. Development can alter the historic or natural drainage paths. When these alterations result in a local on-site drainage system that discharges back into the natural drainage-way or wash at or near the historic location, then the alterations (inter-basin transfer) are generally acceptable. However, when flows from the local on-site drainage system do not return to the historic drainage-way or wash, then inter-basin transfer may result. These inter-basin transfers are generally not acceptable. Planning and design of drainage systems shall not be based on the premise that storm water can be transferred from one basin to another unless part of an adopted city regional drainage system plan. 
    The flow of storm runoff shall be maintained within its natural drainage course unless reasonable use is demonstrated otherwise. When storm water is discharged into an existing drainage course, the peak discharge into the water course shall not adversely affect or cause damage to property along the drainage course now or in the future based on existing zoning and the Carson City master plan build-out conditions. Erosional impacts due to concentration of flows and increased flow durations shall be evaluated and mitigated. 
14.1.5  Water Quality. Storm drainage improvements shall incorporate water quality and erosion controls in accordance with the Nevada "Handbook of Best Management Practices," this division, and accepted engineering practice. Storm drainage leaving a development may not be of a quality that shall adversely affect downstream uses. 
14.1.6  Drainage Improvements. Drainage improvements consist of curb and gutter, inlets and storm drains, culverts, bridges, swales, ditches, channels, detention areas, and other drainage facilities required to convey design storm runoff to the point of discharge. Drainage improvements are further defined as on-site (private) facilities that serve a specific development and are privately owned and maintained or off-site (public) facilities. Public and private drainage facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this division. 
14.1.7  Floodplain Management. Floodplain management shall provide the guidance, conditions, and restrictions for development in floodplain areas while protecting the public's health, safety, welfare, and property from danger and damage. Development within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated floodplains shall comply with CCMC, and requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 
14.1.8  Storm Runoff Detention. Detention is considered a viable method to reduce storm runoff from developed properties. Temporarily detaining storm runoff can significantly reduce downstream flood hazards as well as pipe and channel requirements. Storage also provides for sediment and debris collection which reduces maintenance requirements for downstream channels and streams. 
    Local detention storage for land development, which includes subdividing land, shall be required when the development increases flows and downstream conveyance capacities of the drainage system are not capable of handling non-detained flows, and the developer elects to not upgrade the existing storm drainage system. Onsite detention storage shall be sized to detain sufficient runoff to limit flows from a five (5) year storm (Q5) to their predevelopment condition. 
    The capacity of downstream conveyance systems shall be analyzed in accordance with this division and shall be based on runoff from the development as fully improved. Local detention can also be required when designated in flood or drainage master plans to reduce the peak rate in regional facilities. 
    Exemptions to the detention policy may be granted by the city for the following: 
1.  Developments which discharge directly to a regional flood control facility, provided the facility is completed per the adopted plan and designed for the contributing flows. 
2.  Locations where a local detention facility is designed and constructed to serve several developments and the contributing flows. 
3.  Downstream facilities are upgraded to accommodate the increased flow. 
4.  Where the downstream facilities are adequate to carry up to one hundred (100) year flows. 
    All exemptions are subject to approval by the city. 
14.1.9  Lower Watershed Design. In certain circumstances, i.e., close to the drainage system's point of discharge, it may be desirable to not detain storm water runoff. The option to directly discharge shall be at the sole option of the city and after review of a flood route analysis. 
14.1.10  Storm Runoff Retention and Infiltration. Storm runoff retention and infiltration has been used to eliminate the need for constructing outlet structures and for ease of construction. However, problems with retention basins and infiltration facilities include perpetual maintenance requirements, soil expansion, siltation, decreasing infiltration capacity, insect abatement and also poses a hazard to city groundwater resources through possible contamination. 
14.1.11  Drainage Facilities Maintenance. An important part of all storm drainage facilities is the continued maintenance of the facilities to insure they shall function as designed. Maintenance of detention facilities involves removal of debris and sediment. Such tasks are necessary to preclude the facility from becoming unhealthy and to retain the effectiveness of the detention basin. Sediment and debris must also be periodically removed from channels and storm drains. Trashrack and street inlets must be regularly cleared of debris to maintain system capacity. Channel bank erosion, damage to drop structures, crushing of pipe inlets and outlets, and deterioration to the facilities must be repaired to avoid reduced conveyance capability, unsightliness, and ultimate failure. 
    All drainage facilities shall be designed to minimize facility maintenance as well as to provide ease of maintenance and include maintenance access to the drainage facility. The owner of the drainage facilities shall be responsible for mosquito control and the method of control shall comply with Carson City environmental health department. 
    The property owner or developer shall be responsible for maintenance of all privately owned on-site drainage facilities including, but not limited to, inlets, pipes, channels, and detention basins, unless otherwise required or modified by separate agreement. Shall the property owner or developer fail to adequately maintain said facilities, Carson City shall be given the right to enter said property, upon proper notice, for the purposes of maintenance. All such maintenance costs shall be assessed against the owner(s). A maintenance agreement shall be provided to the city for all projects. 
14.1.12  Drainage Easements. Easements shall be provided where necessary for access and maintenance of the storm drain system. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
14.2 - Technical criteria. 
14.2.1  Design Storm Events. Drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the run off for the twenty-four (24) hour duration storm with a recurrence interval for a minor storm event (five (5) year) and a major storm event (one hundred (100) year). 
14.2.1.1  Storm Runoff Determination. Storm runoff (rates and volumes) shall be determined in accordance with the following methods (other methods may be used if approved by development engineering): 
Contributing Basin Area (A) Computation Procedure A = 100 Acres Rational formula, SCS TR-55, or HEC-1 SCS Unit Hydrograph or Kinematic Wave) 10 SM.> A = 100 Acres SCS TR-55 or HEC-1 (SCS Unit Hydrograph or Kinematic Wave) A > 10 S.M. HEC-1 (SCS Unit Hydrograph or Kinematic Wave)  
14.2.1.2  Rainfall. Rainfall data tables and storm design information shall be derived from the NOAA Atlas, latest edition, or other city approval. 
14.2.1.3  Streets. The use of streets to convey runoff, although naturally occurring, interferes with the primary function of the street for transportation purposes. Streets are, however, an important component in the storm drainage system due to their large storm carrying capacity obtained for little or no drainage costs. In order to balance these two competing street uses, limits on the street carrying capacity are required based on the street classification related to emergency usage during storm and flood events. 
    The allowable street capacity for different roadway functional classifications shall be determined in accordance with Table 14.1 and Table 14.2. To ensure cleaning velocities at low flows, gutters shall have a minimum slope of four-tenths of one percent (0.40%). 
14.2.1.4  Culverts, Bridges, Valley Gutter and Dip Sections. Culverts and bridges shall be installed where natural or manmade drainage channels are crossed by streets. Valley gutters, or "dip sections," shall be permitted on local streets. The amount of channel flow which crosses over the street shall be minimized (not more than 0.5 feet) to protect the street embankment and pavement from erosion damage as well as to protect vehicles and pedestrians from dangerous flow depths and velocities. Bridges and culvert crossings under streets shall be sized for the required design storm capacity in accordance with Table 14.1. 
Table 14.1

Design Storm Criteria Design Storm Event (see Notes) 1. Local Streets 25-year return period, 24-hour duration 2. Arterial and Collector Streets 100-year return period, 24-hour duration 3. Developments (commercial, industrial, residential) 5-year return period, 24-hour duration  
Notes: 
1. All development shall provide emergency flow paths for a one hundred (100) year peak storm in accordance with Table 14.2. 
2. Refer to section 14.3.1 for additional situations where the drainage system shall be designed for not less than a one hundred (100) year return period, twenty-four (24) hour duration. 
3. Refer to section 14.1.8 for additional requirements for projects located within a floodplain. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
14.3 - Storm drain system. 
14.3.1  Introduction. The size of the storm drain system is generally governed by the design storm peak flows as shown in Table 14.2. There are conditions, however, when the storm drain system design shall be governed by the one hundred (100) year return period, twenty-four (24) hour duration storm flows. Storm drain systems shall be designed for not less than a one hundred (100) year peak storm for the following situations: 
1.  Locations where street flow is collected in a sump with no allowable overflow capacity. 
2.  Locations where the desired one hundred (100) year return period, twenty-four (24) hour duration storm flow direction is not reflected by the street flow direction during a one hundred (100) year return period, twenty-four (24) hour duration storm (i.e., flow splits at intersections). 
    If a storm drain is to be designed to convey one hundred (100) year return period, twenty-four (24) hour duration storm flows, then the inlets to the storm drain shall be designed accordingly. 
Table 14.2 
Design Storm Street Capacity Limitations 
Roadway Functional Classification Maximum Limits of Street Inundation (See Notes) 1) Arterial Q5 Storm: Flow contained in R/W. No curb overtopping. A minimum forty-eight foot (48') wide dry lane centered shall be maintained and in each direction twenty-four feet (24'). Runoff in excess of street capacity shall be piped. Q100 Storm: Flow contained to not inundate structures. Maximum depth at gutter flow line shall be 1 foot (1'). A minimum twelve foot (12') wide dry lane shall be maintained in each direction or twenty-four feet (24') centered. 2) Collector Q5 Storm: Flow contained in R/W. No curb overtopping. A minimum eighteen foot (18') wipe dry lane centered shall be maintained. Runoff in excess of street capacity shall be piped. Q100 Storm: Flow contained to not inundate structures. Maximum depth at gutter flow line shall be one foot (1'). A minimum twelve foot (12') wide dry lane shall be maintained centered. 3) Local or Industrial Street Q5 Storm: Flow contained in R/W. No curb overtopping. A minimum twelve foot (l2') wide dry lane centered shall be maintained. Runoff in excess of street capacity shall be piped. Q100 Storm: Flow contained to not inundate structures. Maximum depth at gutter flow line shall be one foot (1'). Street flooded.  
Notes: 
1. Where no curb exists, encroachment onto adjacent property shall be allowed but must contained to not inundate structures. 
2. Other criteria such as the Federal Housing Administration regulations may impose standards more restrictive than cited. 
14.3.2  Design Criteria. 
14.3.2.1  Allowable Storm Drain Capacity. 
    The storm drain capacity calculations shall begin at the storm drain outlet and proceed upstream, accounting for all energy losses. The Energy Grade Line (EGL) and Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL) shall be calculated to include all hydraulic losses including friction, expansion, constriction, bend, and junction losses. The available energy at all junctions and transitions shall be checked to determine whether or not the flow in the storm drain shall be pressurized due to backwater effects even if the design flow is less than the full flow capacity of the storm drain. 
    If any section of the storm drain is pressurized due to backwater effects, then the storm drain system shall be designed to convey the design storm under surcharged or pressure flow conditions. The storm drain shall be considered surcharged when the depth of flow (HGL) in the storm drain is greater than eighty percent (80%) of full flow depth. The maximum level of surcharging for the capacity analysis shall be limited to maintaining the HGL to one foot (1') below the final grade above the storm drain at all locations. Special site conditions that warrant additional surcharging shall require locking type manhole covers or grated covers and shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by development engineering. 
14.3.2.2  Allowable Storm Drain Velocity. The maximum allowable storm drain velocity is dependent on many factors including the type of pipe, the acceptable wear level during the pipe design life, proposed flow conditions (open channel versus pressure flows), and the type and quality of construction of joints, manholes, and junctions. In consideration of the above factors, the maximum velocity in all storm drains and culverts shall not exceed the erosion resisting capabilities of the conduit and storm drain system, but in no case exceed fifteen feet (15') per second (fps). 
    All storm drains and culverts, and low flow outlets shall be designed to maintain a minimum velocity of three (3) fps at half or full conduit conditions, but in no case shall the storm drain slope be less than one-fourth percent (1/4%). 
14.3.2.3  Manning's Roughness Coefficient. All storm drain system hydraulic calculations shall be performed using Manning's formula. A Manning's roughness factor, or "n," shall be as defined by the specific pipe manufacturer provided that the coefficient is within the range of accepted engineering standards. 
14.3.2.4  Pipe Size. The minimum pipe size for storm inlet laterals and storm drain mains shall be fifteen inches (15?) in diameter for round pipe, or an equivalent flow area for other pipe shapes. 
14.3.2.5  Minimum and Maximum Cover. The required cover over a storm drain pipe is dependent on many factors including the design pipe strength, pipe size, and cover material. For practical purposes, the storm drain shall be protected from potential surface disturbances and displacements. The minimum and maximum cover is dependent upon the design pipe strength. 
14.3.2.6  Manhole and Junction Spacing. A manhole, catch basin, or junction box shall be located at all changes in pipe size, direction, elevation and grade for all pipes with a diameter (or rise dimension) of less than forty-eight inches (48?), and at the end of all public storm drain lines (unless the storm drain daylights at the end of the line). Maximum spacing between manholes or junction boxes shall be three hundred fifty feet (350'). For pipes with a diameter (or rise dimension) of forty-eight inches (48?) and greater, the designer shall consult with development engineering for location of manholes and junctions based on hydraulic and maintenance considerations. 
14.3.2.7  Horizontal Alignment. The horizontal alignment of storm drains shall be generally straight between manholes and/or junctions. All storm drains shall be placed within the right-of-way dedicated for public streets unless the use of easements is approved by development engineering. 
    When storm drains are to be installed in existing streets, factors such as curbs, gutters, drainage ditches, sidewalks, traffic conditions, pavement conditions, future street improvement plans, and existing utilities shall be considered by the design engineer when selecting the storm drain location and alignment. 
14.3.2.8  Utility Clearances. Storm drains and culverts shall be located to minimize potential contamination and disturbance of water supply and sanitary sewer mains. Additional requirements may be imposed by the local utility companies, or the Nevada Division of Health. Where requirements differ, the more stringent shall apply. 
14.3.2.9  Storm Inlet and Catch Basin Types, Locations, and Capacity Factors. Standard storm inlet and catch basin details are included in the standard details. The allowable use of these storm inlet and catch basin types is presented on Table 14.3. Allowable inlet capacity factors for each of the standard inlets and catch basins are also presented on Table 14.3. These capacity factors shall be applied to the theoretical capacity of the inlets and catch basins to account for conditions which decrease the capacity of the standard inlets. These conditions include plugging from debris and sediment, pavement overlaying, variations in design assumptions, and the general deterioration of the inlet and catch basin conditions over time. All catch basins shall have sumps (seventeen inches (17?) minimum, twenty-four inches (24?) maximum). 
    Catch basins or inlets shall be installed at low points of vertical curves, at all street intersections, and at sufficient intervals to intake the design storm peak flow such that flows shall not interfere with traffic or flood adjoining property in accordance with the requirements of Table 14.2. Catch basins and inlets at street intersections shall be located on the upstream side of the intersection and upstream of crosswalk locations. 
    When storm drain pipes are connected to a catch basin, inlet, or manhole with concrete/grout, both the inside and outside of the catch basin, manhole, or inlet shall be grouted at the pipe connection. 
14.3.3  Materials. 
14.3.3.1  Pipe Material and Shape. 
    The material and shape of the storm drain shall be in accordance with the "Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction."

The maximum headwater for the design storm for culverts greater than thirty-six inches (36?) diameter or a culvert rise of thirty-six inches (36?) shall be one-and-one-half (1.5) times the culvert height. The maximum headwater for culverts with a height of thirty-six inches (36?) or less shall be five feet (5') if adjacent properties are not adversely affected. 
14.3.5.5  Alignment. Whenever possible, culverts shall be aligned with the natural channel to reduce inlet and outlet transition problems. 
14.3.5.6  Temporary Crossing. Temporary crossings are defined as dip road sections with a culvert sized to pass nuisance flow, or a culvert system that does not meet criteria presented in this manual. Temporary crossings shall be reviewed on a case by case basis. Consideration shall be given to the following items:

(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
14.4 - Detention. 
14.4.1  Introduction. The main purpose of a detention basin is to temporarily store runoff and reduce peak discharge by allowing flow to be discharged at a controlled rate. This controlled discharge rate shall be determined so that post-development runoff shall not exceed pre-development runoff leaving the site. 
    Detention facilities shall be designed by and financed by developers or local property owners. The facilities are intended to allow development by protecting a site from existing flooding conditions or to protect downstream property from increased runoff caused by development. 
14.4.2  Detention Facilities. Detention facilities shall comply with the following: 
1.  Impounding of water for storm water control purposes shall comply with regulations of the Nevada state engineer for the construction of dams where pertinent. 
2.  The potential for use of detention basins for multiple uses must be reviewed with the parks department, and if acceptable to the city, must be designed to accommodate these additional uses. 
3.  Basins shall be sited within drainage easements. 
4.  Detention basin outlet capacity shall be based on the downstream channel capacities (existing or build-out conditions) with consideration given to inflows occurring downstream of the detention basin and changes in flow conditions and hydraulics due to the use of the upstream detention basin, and shall not exceed the pre-developed flow rate (up to the design storm) for the affected property (see section 14.1.2.5 (storm runoff detention)). 
5.  In-channel detention basins shall be required to safely pass the probable maximum flood discharge as a minimum. 
6.  Detention ponds shall be designed to include provisions for security, public safety, landscaping, and erosion control. 
7.  Basins shall be drained in not more than forty-eight (48) hours. (Drain time is defined as the time from the end of precipitation until the basin is drained of ninety percent (90%) of design capacity.) 
8.  Design of all detention basins shall include emergency spillways for one hundred (100) year storms protected against erosive forces. 
9.  A minimum of one foot (1') of freeboard is required above the emergency spillway design water surface elevation. 
10.  Basin discharge shall be self-regulating (passive). 
11.  Generally detention basins shall have side slopes no steeper than 5:1 horizontal to vertical. Access to basins shall be provided by a paved ramp with slope no steeper than 6:1 horizontal to vertical with a minimum width of twelve feet (12'). 
14.4.6  Flow Restrictor Outlets. The flow restrictor outlet shall be sized to control discharge from a basin as set forth in section 14.1.9 (storm runoff detention). Outfall from a flow restrictor shall be provided by a culvert or pipe conduit. The types of flow restrictors for parking lot detention may be under sidewalk weirs or pipes. 
14.4.7  Spillways. All detention facilities shall have the ability to pass flows in excess of the design storm without endangering the structural integrity of the facility or diverting flows from their historic drainage pattern. Impacts to downstream properties shall be considered when siting and designing the spillway(s). 
14.4.8  Sizing Requirements. All detention basins shall have emergency spillways which safely pass, as a minimum, a hydrograph developed by using the one hundred (100) year return period, twenty-four (24) hour duration storm. 
14.4.9  Embankment Protection. Embankments shall be protected from structural failure from overtopping. Overtopping can be caused by a larger than design inflow, or from obstruction of the low flow outlet. Embankment protection shall be provided by embankment armoring (i.e. rip-rap), use of slopes of 5:1 (horizontal to vertical) or flatter, or by a design overflow section (i.e., emergency spillway). The invert of the emergency spillway shall be set equal to or above the design storm water surface elevation. 
14.4.10  Maintenance Requirements. All detention facilities shall be designed to minimize maintenance and to allow access by equipment and workers to perform maintenance. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
14.5 - Trash racks. 
    All outlet works, the upper end of all closed conduits, and low flow conduits shall be provided with a trash rack for debris control. The trash rack shall provide a maximum bar spacing not to exceed two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the outlet opening or diameter. The total area of the trash rack shall allow for passage of the design outlet flow with fifty percent (50%) of the trash rack blocked. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
14.6 - Submittal and review process. 
    The purpose of the submittal and review process is to determine whether or not the drainage plan and improvements for a given project meet Carson City drainage requirements. These requirements include overall facility planning to assure an integrated and coordinated design as well as design standards to assure consistent design and analysis. Drainage study submittal requirements for all land development in Carson City are presented in the following section and summarized in Table 14.6. The submittal requirements are intended to provide the necessary information for each development, and minimize review time. The submittal and review process does not relieve the design engineer of the responsibility to provide a correct and safe drainage design, nor the developer to properly construct the designed drainage facilities. 
    By reviewing and approving drainage designs for given developments, Carson City shall not assume liability for improper drainage design, nor guarantee that the final drainage design review shall absolve the developer or designer of future liability for improper design or construction.

Division 15 - WATER, SEWER, RECLAIMED WATER STANDARDS 
Sections: 

15.1 - General information. 
15.1.1  Water and Sewer. Water and sewer mains shall be extended for the following: 
a.  Parcel map development with a property line within four hundred feet (400') of an existing water or sewer main or as otherwise required in these standards. Prior to recording a parcel map, the owner/developer shall submit improvement plans to Carson City development engineering and Carson City fire department for approval of water and sewer main extensions (the fire department approval is required for water main extensions only). The owner/developer shall construct the water and sewer mains or provide the engineering division with a suitable bond equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the engineer's cost estimate prior to recording the parcel map. 
b.  Water and sewer mains shall be extended the entire frontage(s) of the parcel unless engineering analysis determines it is physically impossible to do so or it is determined by the city engineer that further extension of the main beyond the parcel can never occur or it is not necessary for continuity of the system, or the extension of the main is to accommodate a failed well or septic system. In such cases, the length of extension shall be determined by the city engineer or designee. Construction of a single family residence on a parcel not associated with a subdivision, planned unit development (PUD) or parcel map development and currently served by an existing main shall not require extension of the main(s). Construction of a single family residence on a corner lot not associated with a subdivision, PUD or parcel map development shall require extension along one (1) street frontage only. 
c.  The utilities department shall identify possible locations of insufficient capacity to be addressed by developer's engineer. The developer shall be responsible for main extensions when the design capacity of existing mains is less than that required to serve a development. Mains shall be extended when existing mains are physically inaccessible to maintenance crews and equipment, as determined by the city engineer or designee. 
d.  For the purposes of administering these standards for main extensions and replacements, developments are defined as follows: 
    subdivisions, PUD's, parcel map developments; 
    new building construction; 
    multi-family, commercial and industrial additions or remodels which may result in an increase in the historical water usage or sewer contribution for the parcel. 
e.  Reclaimed water mains shall not be required to be extended if the parcel does not receive connection. Connection to reclaimed water mains require the developer to obtain approval from local and state agencies. 
15.1.2  Reimbursement Agreements. The owner/developer may apply to the Carson City development engineering services for future reimbursement from adjacent property owners which connect to the main extension per the provisions of Carson City Municipal Code (CCMC). Carson City development engineering services shall process the developer's application and, upon approval of a reimbursement agreement by the board of supervisors, the agreement shall be administered by the engineering department. 
15.1.3  Participation in Oversizing Mains. When the oversizing of mains has been requested by the city engineer, the development shall participate in the installation of oversized water and sewer mains as per the provisions of the Carson City Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 2001-23, Development Standards). 
15.2 - Improvement plan requirements.

    Street sign displays the primary name, suffix, direction from a baseline and the north, south, east or west hundred block indicator of each street name. 
    Story is the vertical distance from top to top of two successive finished floor surfaces; and for the topmost story, from the floor finish to the top of the ceiling joists or, where there is not a ceiling, to the top of the roof rafters. 
    Suite number - See unit number for definition. 
    Structure is any fence, tower, edifice, or building of any kind, or any piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some temporary or definite manner which requires location on the ground or is attached to something having a location on the ground which extends more than 36 inches above grade. 
    Suffix is a word in a street name used to indicate a type of street. That portion of a street name which indicates that it is a right-of-way, such as "Street," "Avenue," "Lane," "Road," "Circle," "Way," etc.

22.5 - Configuration for Street Naming. 
22.5.1  Offset Street Alignments. 
a.  When a street changes its alignment at an intersection by a distance equal to or less than two times the width of the right-of-way, it shall retain the name of the original alignment to provide traffic and addressing continuity. See Figure 2A. 
b.  When a street changes its alignment at an intersection by a distance greater than two times the width of the right-of-way, it shall be assigned a new street name. See Figure 2A. 
c.  Curvilinear streets shall maintain the same street name. See Figure 2B. 
d.  When a street shifts its alignment (north/south on an east/west alignment or east/ west on a north/south alignment), it shall be assigned a new street name. See Figure 2C. 
22.5.2  Straight Streets. 
a.  A newly developed street shall assume the name of the street with which it aligns if such alignment exists. See Figure 3A. 
b.  When a street is not in alignment with, nor an extension of any existing street, a new street name shall be assigned to the street. See Figure 3B. 
c.  Once a street name is assigned to an alignment, it may not be assigned to any other alignment or be assigned if it will not connect in the future. See Figure 3C. 
22.5.3  Cul-de-sac and Bubble Streets. 
a.  When a cul-de-sac is located at the end of an existing street right-of-way or alignment, it shall be given the same primary name and suffix of that street, whether the cul-de-sac is straight, curves or meanders. See Figure 4A. 
b.  When cul-de-sacs are located in such a manner as to be connected to each other by a straight or arcing street which is more or less perpendicular to an adjoining street alignment forming a "T" intersection, said cul-de-sacs and the connecting street shall be given the same primary street name, which must be a different name then the street it connects to. See Figure 4B. 
c.  When cul-de-sacs approach each other from opposite directions and are on the same alignment but do not join in any manner, they shall be assigned different street names. See Figure 4C. 
d.  When two cul-de-sacs are in direct alignment, bisected perpendicularly by a street, the cul-de-sac shall be assigned the same street name. See Figure 4D. 
e.  When a bubble street less than 100 feet in length is located perpendicular to the primary street, the bubble street shall assume the primary name and address numbering of the street which it adjoins. See Figure 4E. 
22.5.4  Circle, Horseshoe, and Loop Streets. 
a.  A circular or horseshoe shaped street shall not be assigned the same primary street name as that of the principal street it intersects. See Figure 5A.

c.  In the case of loop streets having only one access, each segment of the loop will bear the same primary street name. See Figure 5C. 
d.  When circular streets are segmented into halves or quarters by intersecting streets, the following shall apply: 
(1)  No two streets terminating on the same circle shall have the same name. See Figure 6A. 
(2)  If the intersecting streets maintain the same primary street name on both sides of the intersected circle and buildings are to be built along the circular street, then each resulting segment of the circular street shall be assigned a different street name. See Figure 6B. 
(3)  If the intersecting streets maintain the same primary street name on both sides of the intersected circle and no buildings are to be built along the circular street, then the circular street may maintain the same primary street name. See Figure 6C. 
22.5.5  Curvilinear Streets. 
a.  A street which leaves its alignment by not more than 150 feet may retain the name of the original alignment. See Figure 7A. 
b.  A street which leaves its alignment by more than 150 feet but returns to its original section alignment, shall use the primary street name of the original alignment. See Figure 7B.

In the event the owner of the aircraft fails for any reason to remove the wrecked or damaged aircraft from the Airport as may be requested by the Airport Manager, or to remove it from the traffic areas as herein indicated, the Airport Manager may cause the removal and storage, or disposal of such wrecked or damaged aircraft at the expense of the aircraft owner. 
( Ord. No. 2016-14, § 2, 10-6-2016 ) 
19.02.020.210 - GROUND RULES. 
1.  No person shall park, store, tie down, or leave any aircraft on any areas of the Airport other than that prescribed by FBO lease or by the Airport Manger. 
2.  No aircraft shall be parked or stored on the Airport unless it is properly tied down or secured. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or pilot of such aircraft to tie down or secure the aircraft at all times required by these rules and regulations or by weather or other conditions on the Airport. In the case of large aircraft it shall be the responsibility of the owner or pilot of the aircraft to secure the aircraft in the best manner and to avoid parking the aircraft in such an area or position as to cause damage to other aircraft or buildings on the Airport in the event of winds or weather. Owners of all aircraft shall be held responsible for any damage or loss resulting from the failure of such owner or the pilot of such aircraft to comply with this rule. 
3.  No person shall take or use any aircraft anchoring or tie-down facilities when such facilities are already in actual use by another person. 
4.  All major repairs to aircraft or engines as defined in Part 43 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) shall be made in the space or areas designated for this purpose by the FBO lease or the Airport Manager and not on any part of the landing area, taxiways, ramps or gassing or service areas of a fixed base operator, unless such fixed base operator consents to such use for repairs. 
5.  No aircraft engine shall be started on an aircraft unless a competent operator is in control of the aircraft and parking brakes have been set or the wheels have been set with blocks that are equipped with ropes or other suitable means for removing such blocks. 
6.  The engine shall be started, warmed up and run up only in the places designated for such purposes. No aircraft engine shall be started, run or run up unless the aircraft is in such a position that the propeller blast is clear of all hangars, shops, other buildings, persons, other aircraft and automobiles or vehicles in the area, and the flight path of landing aircraft. 
19.02.020.220 - TAXIING. 
1.  All aircraft shall be taxied at a low and reasonable speed and when not equipped with adequate brakes, shall have an attendant beside a wing when the aircraft is taxied near buildings or other aircraft. 
2.  Aircraft awaiting take-off shall hold short of the runway in use and in a position so as to have a direct view of aircraft approaching for a landing. 
3.  No person shall taxi an aircraft until he has ascertained that there will be no danger of collision with any person or object in the immediate area by visual inspection of the area. 
19.02.020.230 - TRAFFIC RULES. 
1.  Runway 27 is designated as the calm wind (five (5) knots or less) runway and should be used for take-off and landing, until the wind-tee, AWOS or the Airport Unicom clearly indicates the use of a different runway, in which case landings and take-offs should be made directly into the wind or on the runway most nearly aligned into the wind. In case of light shifting winds, runway 27 shall be preferred unless its use presents a safety hazard. This rule is not intended to overrule the decision of the pilot in command of the aircraft as to the safest practice. 
2.  All pre-take-off checks must be completed before taxiing to take-off position. Take-off will be made immediately after taxiing onto the runway. 
3.  When using runway 27, except as safety dictates otherwise, all aircraft taking off must proceed straight ahead until reaching the end of the runway and execute a left turn to a heading of two hundred thirty (230) degrees as soon as safely possible. After attaining a minimum altitude of seven hundred (700) feet AGL (five thousand four hundred (5,400) feet MSL) and ascertaining there is no danger of collision with other aircraft, the pilot may execute a left or right cross-wind turn as appropriate. The pilot should be noise sensitive to surrounding neighborhoods, and if possible when departing the pattern, delay making the crosswind turn until west of U.S. Business 395 (Carson Street) and resume normal navigation procedures. 
4.  When using runway 9, except as safety dictates otherwise, all aircraft taking off must proceed straight ahead until reaching the end of the runway and execute a slight left turn to eighty-five (85) degrees. After attaining a minimum altitude of seven hundred (700) feet AGL (five thousand four hundred (5,400) feet MSL) and ascertaining there is no danger of collision with other aircraft, resume normal navigational procedures. 
5.  Aircraft intending to remain in the traffic pattern shall continue to climb to the traffic altitude of one thousand (1,000) feet AGL (5700 MSL) after the cross-wind turn from runway heading, and shall thereafter follow the pattern as set forth on the attached charts. 
6.  The published traffic pattern altitude is one thousand (1,000) feet AGL. Aircraft having flight characteristics which make the above procedure impractical shall be flown at appropriate altitudes for type of aircraft, but shall conform to the pattern shown as nearly as possible. 
7.  Aircraft violating the traffic rules shall be reported to the FAA by the Airport Manager for investigation. 
19.02.020.240 - LANDINGS. 
1.  Approach and landings shall be left-hand pattern Runway 27 and a right-hand pattern for Runway 9. The designated Airport calm wind runway (below 5 knots) is Runway 27. 
2.  Aircraft entering the traffic pattern, within a five-mile radius of the Airport, should do so at an angle of forty-five (45) degrees on the downwind leg and at a minimum altitude of one thousand (1,000) feet above the surface, or as prescribed in the FAA Aeronautical Information Manual as updated by the FAA.http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM 
3.  Except in cases of touch-and-go landings and take-offs, all aircraft shall turn off the runway as soon as reasonably possible after landing and taxi only on designated taxiways unless the condition of the taxiway makes it advisable to use the runway for taxiing. 
4.  A landing pattern diagram shall be made available by the Authority. 
19.02.020.250 - FIRE REGULATIONS. 
1.  All activities at the Carson City Airport are subject to the Fire Code of Carson City, Title 14, CCMC, as amended. In the event of conflict, the Fire Code of Carson City shall prevail over Title 19. (Editors note: At the time of this revision, Carson City has adopted the 2006 International Fire Code. It is anticipated that updates will occur from time to time and may involve adoption of additional or other codes.) 
2.  No aircraft may be fueled or de-fueled while its engine is running, or while in a hangar or other enclosed place. Fueling shall be accomplished with equipment that provides adequate connections for continuous grounding of static electricity. 
3.  Storage, transportation and transfer of fuel and other flammable or combustible liquids shall comply with the Fire Code of Carson City, including conformance to Maximum Allowable Quantities and use of approved containers or tanks. 
4.  The cleaning of motors or other parts of aircraft using flammable or combustible cleaning materials shall be subject to applicable fire and safety codes. 
5.  All persons using in any way the Airport area or the facilities of the Airport shall exercise the utmost care to guard against fire and injury to persons or property. 
6.  All hangar and shop floors shall be kept clean and free from oil, fuel and other flammable and combustible substances. No volatile flammable or combustible solvent shall be used for cleaning floors except as permitted by the fire code. No rags soiled with flammable substances shall be kept or stored in any building on the Airport in such a manner as to create any fire hazard. 
7.  No person shall weld, smoke or ignite any matches, flares, lighters or other objects which produce an open flame, produce sparks, or other sources of ignition anywhere within a hangar, shop, building or structure in which any fuel, oil or flammable substance is stored or within fifty (50) feet or any gassing fueling facility. 
8.  Periodic inspections of buildings on the Airport may be conducted by the Carson City Fire Department or the Airport Manager to check for compliance of fire and safety issues. Such inspections are for the purpose of assisting in meeting codes and safety requirements. No such inspection shall be used by the hangar owner to replace the hangar owner's obligations to comply with all codes and safety requirements.

    19.02.020.370- AIRCRAFT STORAGE HANGAR USE. 
1)  General: These provisions are adopted to implement the FAA's "Policy on the Non-Aeronautical Use of Airport Hangars" published in the Federal Register/Vol. 81, No. 115/Wednesday, June 15, 2016/Pages 38906-38911, which takes effect July 1, 2017. 
A.  Aircraft storage hangars at the Carson City Airport are to be used and occupied for an aeronautical use. 
B.  As provided for in the FAA Policy, non-aeronautical items are also permitted in a hangar so long as they do not interfere with the aeronautical use of the hangar. 
2)  Aeronautical Use: Qualifying aeronautical uses for storage hangars include: 
A.  Storage of active aircraft. 
B.  Final assembly of aircraft under construction. 
C.  Non-commercial construction of amateur built or kit- built aircraft. 
D.  Maintenance, repair or refurbishment of aircraft, but not indefinite storage of nonoperational aircraft. 
E.  Storage of aircraft handling equipment such as tow bars, glider tow equipment, workbenches, and tools and materials used in the servicing, maintenance, repair or outfitting of aircraft. 
F.  Vacant awaiting aircraft occupancy such as: Aircraft in use, on travel, or away for maintenance. 
G.  Vacant reserved for aircraft domiciled at another airport, for anticipated aircraft purchase within a reasonable amount of time, or available for sale or rent. 
H.  Other Aeronautical activity approved by Carson City Airport Authority ("Authority") that does not conflict with FAA requirements. 
3)  Permitted Non-Aeronautical Use: 
A.  Airport Area approved by the FAA for Non-Aeronautical use on Airport Layout Plan. 
B.  Non-Aeronautical items within Qualifying Aeronautical Use hangars unless the items: 
1.  Impede the movement of active aircraft in and out of the hangar or impede access to inactive aircraft or other Aeronautical contents of the hangar. 
    Items which can easily be moved to permit access to and/or movement of the aircraft shall not be regarded as an impediment. Typical examples include, but are not limited to: a functional vehicle, workbench, and tool box. 
2.  Displace the Aeronautical contents of the hangar. A functional vehicle parked in a vacant hangar while the aircraft designated or intended to occupy the vacant hangar is absent shall not be considered to displace the aircraft. 
3.  Are stored in violation of airport rules and regulations, lease provisions, building codes or local ordinances. 
C.  Other Uses approved by the Authority in writing. 
D.  Other Uses approved by the FAA. 
4)  Prohibited Uses: 
A.  Residential: Hangars may not be used as a residence. The FAA differentiates between a typical pilot resting facility or aircrew quarters versus a hangar residence or hangar home. The former are designed to be used for overnight and/or resting periods for aircrew, and not as a permanent or even temporary residence. 
B.  Non-Aeronautical Business: Hangars may not be used for the conduct of a non-aeronautical business or municipal agency function unless the business activity is clearly incidental to the aeronautical use of the hangar in the sole judgement of the Airport Authority if called upon to review the question. Examples of conduct of a Non- Aeronautical business include, but are not limited to: storage of inventory; the participation of employees, contractors or others in addition to the hangar occupant; visits from the non-aviation public; and/or deliveries of non-aeronautical items. 
5)  Compliance: To encourage and ensure compliance with this Policy: 
A.  Within 60 days after approval of this Aircraft Storage Hangar Use Policy, and within 60 days after any material change in the information previously reported to the Airport Manager, each Lessee whose ground lease includes one or more Storage Hangars (the "Lessee") shall provide to the Carson City Airport Manager, for retention and distribution to the members of the Authority, timely contact information for each occupant, lessee, and owner of a hangar located upon the Lessee's ground lease, identifying information for any and all aircraft stored in Lessee's hangars, and a written statement of the basis by which the Lessee believes each hangar qualifies as Aeronautical Use. 
B.  If the Airport Manager or an Authority member disputes a Lessee's claim of aeronautical use, the Lessee may appeal the dispute to the entire Authority, whose decision shall be final. 
C.  If it is determined by the Airport Manager, and not appealed, or by the Authority upon appeal, that a hangar located upon the Lessee's ground lease has not met the qualifications for aeronautical use, either the Airport Manager at the direction of and under the authority of the Authority, or the Authority itself, whichever made the final decision, shall require the Lessee to have the subject hangar brought into compliance with this Policy or become subject to any and all enforcement actions permitted under Nevada law, including but not limited to increases in rents and eviction of the subtenant/hangar occupant. 
D.  If it is determined by the Authority that a Lessee or hangar Occupant has misrepresented material facts to the Airport Manager or the Authority regarding hangar use and/or failed to comply with the decision of the Authority regarding such use, as an alternative to terminating the lease for non-compliance, the Authority may impose upon the Lessee a non-aeronautical use surcharge on rent in the amount of $1,000 per month per hangar that is not in compliance, or was the subject of the misrepresentation, for the period which the hangar was not in compliance or misrepresentation, in addition to any and all enforcement actions available against the offending Lessee and/or Occupant under relevant Nevada law. 
E.  If the Airport Manager or any member of the Authority verifies that a hangar is in compliance with the aeronautical use provisions of this policy, the hangar shall be considered in compliance.

2.  "Board" means the Carson City Board of Supervisors. 
3.  "City" means the city of Carson City. 
4.  "Permittee" means the entity, be it a person, corporation or partnership that applies for and is granted an access privilege permit by the Authority. 
5.  "Access privilege permit" is a document whereby the Authority grants a privilege to a permittee who is actually doing business on a tract of land adjoining the airport public landing area to gain access to the landing area solely for aircraft used incidental to such business. Said access privilege permit may be transferred to a successor in interest of the permittee so long as the successor in interest is also the owner of real property adjacent to the Airport and reports the transfer of the permit to the Authority. The Authority reserves the right to relocate its taxiways so long as access to the taxiway is accorded to the permittee. The permittee has the duty to maintain its accessway in accordance with Section 19.03.070 and to indemnify the city and the authority pursuant to Section 19.03.160 of this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 2008-36, § I, 12-4-2008 ) 
19.03.020 - Access privileges. 
    Airport access permits shall be limited to one (1) per parcel and to the industrial zoned land adjoining the airport boundary north and east of the airport. 
( Ord. No. 2008-36, § I, 12-4-2008 ) 
19.03.030 - Number of aircraft. 
    The number of aircraft is limited to no more than four (4) resident aircraft per parcel owned by the permittee. A permittee may apply to the Authority for more aircraft per parcel, which increase may be granted by the Authority for good cause. 
( Ord. No. 2008-36, § I, 12-4-2008 ) 
19.03.040 - Method of access. 
    In order to promote airport safety and security the Authority shall not allow an excessive number of through-the-fence accessways entering onto a taxiway. The access points to a taxiway shall be located and coordinated by permittees and the Authority in such a way as to allow joint use of one (1) accessway between adjoining parcels or owners. The Authority shall have discretion to limit a permittee access through an existing access way if the Authority finds that airport safety and security so requires. 
    In addition, except through existing taxiways, there shall be no midfield access permitted to the runway unless and until the northside parallel taxiways are constructed and until said access is approved by the FAA. 
( Ord. No. 2008-36, § I, 12-4-2008 ) 
19.03.050 - Revocation for cause-Procedures. 
1.  An access privilege permit may be revoked for good cause by the Authority. Good cause for such revocation shall include, but is not limited to any act committed by permittee, or permitted or caused by a permittee in conjunction with the access privilege which act is in violation of any law, ordinance or FAA regulation. 
2.  Any permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be revoked in the following manner: 
a.  The Airport Manager may revoke the permit if the permittee fails to pay the permit fee within fifteen (15) days of notification that such fee has not been paid. 
b.  The Authority may, on its own motion or initiative, or upon complaint of any person, institute proceedings to revoke a permit by mailing a complaint setting forth the alleged reason for such permittee as shown by his application or by a supplemental application filed pursuant to the provisions hereof. 
c.  The permittee shall, within ten (10) days of the date of such mailing, file with the secretary of the Authority a written answer to such complaint, under oath. 
d.  The Authority shall fix a day and time for a hearing at which the permittee will be given an opportunity to be heard. 
e.  If the permittee fails to file a written answer within the time required, or if the permittee fails to appear at the place and time designated for the hearing, the Authority may order the privilege permit revoked. 
f.  The Authority shall, within fifteen (15) days after the date of such hearing, enter its order to refuse or revoke the permit. The permittee shall be allowed to operate until the order is entered and mailed to the permittee at his last known address. 
g.  As an alternative to the procedure outlined in the foregoing subsections, the Authority may, on its own initiative or upon the complaint of any person, require the permittee to appear before the Authority at a time and place fixed by the Authority to show cause, why his privilege permit should not be revoked. The hearing shall not be less than five (5) days from the date of service upon the permittee of the order by mailing a copy of the order to him at his last known address or place of business, or by making personal service upon him thereof. The failure by the permittee to appear at the time and place designated by the Authority shall, in and of itself, constitute sufficient grounds for revocation of the permit. 
h.  There shall be no reopening or review of the proceedings whatsoever by the authority except when it subsequently appears to the satisfaction of the Authority that the permittee's failure to answer or appear was due to matters beyond his control, and not through negligence on the part of the permittee. 
i.  In all proceedings under this chapter the Authority shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and documents, and all witnesses thus subpoenaed shall attend at the time and place appointed therein, and failure to attend at the time and place appointed in the subpoena may be regarded by the Authority as contempt thereof, and a finding by the Authority to such effect shall be duly reported to the sheriff for immediate disposition thereon, and shall constitute prima facie evidence of contempt in any municipal court of the City; the penalty for each such offense shall be a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and shall be accompanied by incarceration of not less than two (2) days nor more than thirty (30) days. 
3.  In addition to the other remedies provided in this chapter, the Carson City district attorney's office is authorized to petition the district court for an injunction restraining any permittee from conducting through-the-fence access without a valid permit or written agreement with the Authority.

II.  For properties with hangars and aircraft parked outside of the hangar, one hundred twenty-five dollars (125.00) per aircraft so parked, in addition to the fee in subsection 1 above. 
III.  For each property with a hangar, the fee shall be offset by the amount of real property taxes received by the Airport Authority on said hangar. In the event that the property taxes so received exceed the fees in subsection 1 and 2 above, the property tax will be considered full payment for the annual fee. 
IV.  For properties without hangars and with an access permit and no access being presently used, six hundred twenty-five dollars ($625.00). 
V.  For properties without hangars and with aircraft parked on said properties, seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), plus one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per each aircraft beyond the first aircraft.
