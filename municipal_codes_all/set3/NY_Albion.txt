Code of Ethics  See Ch. 25.
Grievance procedure  See Ch. 35.
Officers and employees  See Ch. 55.
Personnel policies  See Ch. 61.
§ 26-1. Endorsement of policy.
The Village of Albion endorses the policy of progressive discipline. Normal steps in this process are
oral warning, written warning, suspension from duty, and finally discharge. The policy of progressive
discipline does not necessarily apply for a number of the more serious violations or offenses, where
immediate discharge, in line with due process, may be required.
§ 26-2. Determining proper discipline.
A basic principle underlying progressive disciplinary procedures is that the supervisor must have
just cause for imposing the discipline. "Just cause" means that the supervisor has the right to
discipline when an employee does not comply with rules or performance standards. This excludes
disciplinary action for mere whim or caprice. This standard is used in judging whether the
supervisor acted fairly in enforcing rules and regulations. The following questions should be
answered when contemplating a disciplinary action:
Was the rule or order reasonably related to the efficient and safe operation of Village
government?
What was the rule intended to accomplish?
If the rule were observed as written, would the purpose be realized?
Was the rule realistic? Easy to understand?
Was the rule out of date?
Can the rule, as written, be complied with under the present circumstances?
Are the penalties too light? Too severe?
Do the people orating under the rule consider the penalties as being just?
Are the penalties being enforced? If enforcement has been lax in the past, management
shouldn't reverse its course and begin to crack down without first warning employees of
its intent.
Do all the people affected by the rule know the rule?
Was it brought to their attention periodically?
As far as practical, do all people affected know the "why" of the rule?
Was the rule affecting groups that do not need it?
Should the rule be extended to cover groups not now affected by it?
Were certain groups allowed to violate the rule without incurring the penalties?
Was the employee adequately warned of the consequences of his/her conduct? The warning
may be given orally or in printed form. An exception may be made for certain conduct such as

insubordination, drinking on the job, stealing, or using Village property, or other actions so
serious that the employee is expected to know it will be punishable.
Did management investigate before administering the discipline? An investigation should be
made before the decision to discipline is made.
Was the investigation fair and objective? Witnesses should be interviewed, their statements
recorded and a careful investigation made to see that both sides of the story are available and
fairly presented.
Did the investigation produce substantial evidence of the infraction? It is not required that the
evidence be preponderant, conclusive, or beyond reasonable doubt, except where the alleged
misconduct is of such criminal or reprehensive nature as to stigmatize the employee and
seriously impair his/her chances for future employment.
Are there mitigating or aggravating circumstances? Mitigating circumstances (for example,
refusal to obey an order because the employee had received contrary orders from another
supervisor) justify a lesser penalty. Aggravating circumstances (for example, prior violations of
the same rule) justify a more severe penalty. Some points to review when determining
mitigating or aggravating circumstances include:
Prior conduct record. This refers to any formal disciplinary reprimands or suspensions.
Penalties generally become more severe for each instance of misconduct.
Length of service.
Period of time since last penalty. A long period of good conduct following previous
disciplinary action should be considered, since it represents the aim of corrective
discipline. Disciplinary action that occurred more than two years to three years previous
generally is of little value determining the current level of discipline.
In contemplating the dismissal of an employee you might want to ask yourself these
questions:
Does the employee have the skills required for the job?
Is it possible that the content of his/her job has changed since originally hired?
Is his/her attitude towards the job so negative that it is not only affecting his/her
performance, but also that of other individuals in the group?
Have you attempted to motivate him/her to improve performance by setting mutually
acceptable work objectives, observing the worker's progress, and conducting
performance evaluations over short intervals?
After considering the above seven questions, the supervisor should have an indication of the
seriousness of the problem and what sort of disciplinary action would be proper.
§ 26-3. Probationary employees.
The probationary period for original appointees is generally 180 days. The minimum probationary
period is eight weeks. Civil service rules require that probationary employees be advised from time to
time of their status. Termination may be made for any rational reason, including doubts about the
employee's capabilities. A termination notice (see hiring policy) must be in writing and must be given at
least one week prior to the termination.
§ 26-4. Interrogating employees.

"Interrogation" means the questioning of an employee, who at the time of such questioning
appears to be a likely subject for disciplinary action. Interrogation must be done privately under the
following guidelines:
No employee who is represented by a union shall be required to submit to an interrogation
unless the employee is notified in advance of his/her right to have representation present.
An employee shall not be coerced, intimidated or suffer any reprisals, either directly or
indirectly, as a result of exercising his/her right to representation.
The employee's statement should be carefully recorded in writing with a copy provided to the
employee and attached to any disciplinary action that may result from the situation being
investigated.
§ 26-5. Policy.
General.
Employees' have a right to know what is expected of them. It is the responsibility of the
department head, officer or official to communicate the Village's requirements and
expectations to the employee, and to help the employee in meeting these standards. When
disciplinary action is required, such action should be taken on a progressive basis and should
be designed to rehabilitate rather than punish the employee involved. In most cases, informal
action should be attempted before initiating formal disciplinary action.
An investigation should be conducted before the decision to discipline is made. Witnesses
should be interviewed, their statements recorded and carefully considered to insure that the
proposed action is appropriate.
Informal disciplinary process.
Verbal counseling. Verbal counseling is the first step in a disciplinary process and should take
place privately. The supervisor should review the applicable rule or standard with the
employee so she/he knows what's expected. A time frame for compliance should be
established and the consequences of failure to comply should be explained. Immediately
following the meeting, the supervisor should summarize the counseling in writing and save it
for future reference.
Counseling memorandum. Counseling memorandum is the second step in a disciplinary
process and should take place privately. The employee must be notified of the right to union
representation (when the employee is represented by a union). The supervisor should review
the applicable rule or standard with the employee so they know what's expected. A time
frame for compliance should be established and the consequences of failure to comply should
be explained. Immediately following the meeting, the supervisor must summarize the
counseling in writing. The employee must sign the counseling memorandum to acknowledge
that he/she has read it. A copy must be given to the employee, and placed in the employee's
personnel file.
Formal disciplinary process.
Warnings. In the case of a persistent personnel problem or a serious infraction, a written
warning (reprimand) may be necessary. This warning is a formal, written censure that is
placed in the employee's personnel folder. A written warning should be administered in writing
at a private meeting between the employee, the union steward (when the employee is
represented by a union), the supervisor, and the next immediate supervisor. The warning
should include the reason for the warning, what corrective action needs to be taken, and what
will happen if the problem is not resolved. The employee must sign the warning to

acknowledge that he/she has read it. A copy must be given to the employee, sent to the union
president and the Mayor, and placed in the employee's personnel file.
Suspensions and/or termination.
Suspension and/or termination may be required if an employee repeats an action for
which a written warning has been issued or commits a major offense. These include, but
are not limited to:
Failure to perform his/her job.
Destruction or theft of property.
Insubordination.
Committing unlawful acts.
Using abusive language or threatening language.
Appearing on duty in a drunken or drugged condition.
Engaging in discriminatory employment practices.
Other acts of misconduct that impact adversely upon the operation of the Village.
Except in emergencies, imposed penalties should be reviewed with the Attorney for the
Village and the Mayor. A suspension and/or termination should be administered in
vesting at a private meeting between the employee, the union steward (when the
employee is represented by a union), and the department head or Mayor. The notice
should state the reason for the suspension and/or termination. The employee must sign
the notice of suspension/termination to acknowledge that he/she has read it. A copy must
be given to employee, and sent to the union president, the Mayor and placed in the
employee's personnel file.

The Department of Public Safety of the Village of Albion and the office of Public Safety Administrator,

Finances and fundraising  See Ch. 29.
§ 66-1. Review of purchase types; competitive bidding;
documentation.
Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine whether it is a purchase
contract or a public works contract. Once that determination is made, a good faith effort will be
made to determine whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the aggregate amount
to be spent on the item of supply or service is not subject to competitive bidding, taking into
account past purchases and the aggregate amount to be spent in a year. The following items are
not subject to competitive bidding pursuant to § 103 of the General Municipal Law: purchase
contracts under $20,000 and public works contracts under $35,000; emergency purchases; certain
municipal hospital purchases; goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely
handicapped; goods purchased from correctional institutions; purchases under state and county
contracts; and surplus and secondhand purchases from another governmental entity.
[Amended 4-25-2012 by L.L. No. 3-2012]
The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will be documented, in writing,
by the individual making the purchase. This documentation may include written or verbal quotes
from vendors, a memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at, a copy of
the contract indicating the source which makes the item or service exempt, a memo from the
purchaser detailing the circumstances which led to an emergency purchase or any other written
documentation that is appropriate.
§ 66-2. Requests for proposals; exceptions.
[Amended 4-14-2010 by L.L. No. 3-2010]
All goods and services will be secured by use of written requests for proposals, written quotations,
verbal quotations or any other method that assures that goods will be purchased at the lowest
price and that favoritism will be avoided, except in the following circumstances: purchase contracts
over $20,000 and public works contracts over $35,000; goods purchased from agencies for the
blind or severely handicapped pursuant to § 175-b of the State Finance Law; goods purchased
from correctional institutions pursuant to § 186 of the Correction Law; purchases under state
contracts pursuant to § 104 of the General Municipal Law; purchases under county contracts
pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 3, of the General Municipal Law; or purchases pursuant to § 66-6
of this chapter.
[Amended 4-25-2012 by L.L. No. 3-2012]
This procurement policy requires that consideration in the solicitation of bids or quotes for
services, supplies or contracts to be given to:
Small and/or locally owned businesses, with priority to businesses owned by or which employ
low- or moderate-income persons as defined by HUD; and
Qualified minority- and women-owned business enterprises (M/WBE) listed in the directory of
certified minority- and women-owned businesses maintained by the Empire State
Development Corporation on its website at http://205.232.252.35 or at
www.nyloveswmbe.ny.gov. These provisions shall apply to the procurement of goods and
services related to the implementation of the. CDBC-funded programs and activities as well
as to the procurement of goods and services related to the general conduct of business by
the Village of Albion.

§ 66-3. Method of purchase.
The following method of purchase will be used when required by this policy in order to achieve the
highest savings:
[Amended 4-25-2012 by L.L. No. 3-2012]
Purchase contracts.
Estimated Amount of Purchase Contract Method
$250 to $2,999 Verbal quotations
$3,000 to $19,999 Written/fax quotations; written request for
proposals
Public works contract.
Estimated Amount of Purchase Contract Method
$250 to $2,999 Verbal quotations
$3,000 to $4,999 Written/fax quotations
$5,000 to $34,999 Written/fax quotations; written request for
proposals
A good-faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of proposals or quotations. If the
purchaser is unable to obtain the required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event shall the failure to obtain the
proposals be a bar to the procurement.
§ 66-4. Documentation required.
Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each procurement.
§ 66-5. Awarding of contracts.
Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is awarded to other than the lowest
responsible offeror. This documentation will include an explanation of how the award will achieve
savings or how the offeror was not responsible. A determination that the offeror is not responsible shall
be made by the purchaser and may not be challenged under any circumstances.
§ 66-6. Exemptions from solicitation.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f, the procurement policy may contain
circumstances when or types of procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body,
the solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best interest of the municipality.
In the following circumstances, it may not be in the best interests of the Village of Albion to solicit
quotations or document the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
Professional services or services requiring special or technical skill, training or expertise.
The individual or company must be chosen based on accountability, reliability, responsibility,
skill, education and training, judgment, integrity and moral worth. These qualifications are not
necessarily found in the individual or company that offers the lowest price, and the nature of

these services are such that they do not readily lend themselves to competitive procurement
procedures.
In determining whether a service fits into this category, the Board of Trustees shall take into
consideration the following guidelines: whether the services are subject to state licensing or
testing requirements; whether substantial formal education or training is a necessary
prerequisite to the performances of the services; and whether the services require a personal
relationship between the individual and municipal officials. Professional or technical services
shall include, but not be limited to, the following: services of an attorney; services of a
physician; technical services of an engineer engaged to prepare plans, maps and estimates;
securing insurance coverage and/or services of an insurance broker; services of a certified
public accountant; investment management services; printing services involving extensive
writing, editing or artwork; management of municipally owned property; and computer
software or programming services for customized programs or services involved in substantial
modification and customizing of prepackaged software.
Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General Municipal Law. Due to the
nature of this exception, these goods or services must be purchased immediately, and a delay in
order to seek alternate proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of the residents.
This subsection does not preclude alternate proposals if time permits.
Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods from any source. If alternate proposals are required,
the Village of Albion is precluded from purchasing surplus and secondhand goods at auctions or
through specific advertised sources where the best prices are usually obtained. It is also difficult to
try to compare prices of used goods, and a lower price may indicate an older product.
Goods or services under $250. The time and documentation required to purchase through this
policy may be more costly than the item itself and would therefore not be in the best interests of
the taxpayer. In addition, it is not likely that such de minimis contracts would be awarded based on
favoritism.
§ 66-7. Annual review.
This policy will be reviewed annually by the Village Board of Trustees.
Chapter 68. Property, Disposition of
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Albion 3-12-1986. Amendments noted

§ 68-1. Removal or disposition of property.
No property of the village, including wood and earth, may be taken, claimed or removed from
village property by a village employee, except as his or her supervisor may direct that such
property be moved for storage or disposal purposes.
No property, other than broken or used consumable items which are ordinarily of a type or kind
which are discarded and not salvaged after use, shall be disposed of without consent of the
Village Board. It is the duty of the Supervisor to notify the Village Board of any property which they
propose to sell or dispose of. Each supervisor shall provide the Board with the name and address
of a person who generally deals in such type of property, whether it be wood, dirt, shell casings
and furniture (this list is by way of example only and not inclusive), and advise the Board as to
such businessperson's opinion concerning the value of any such property.

in accordance with Subsections C(1) and (2) above.

such person or are only incidental thereto, or of whether use is made of the public streets.
§ 82-3. Utilities to keep records.
Every utility subject to a tax under this article shall keep such records of its business and in such form
as the Treasurer may require, and such records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except
that the Treasurer may consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be kept

§ 82-4. Utilities to file returns.
[Amended 8-14-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or 15th of March, a return for the 12

§ 82-5. Tax payable with return.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall pay to the Treasurer the tax
imposed by this article for the period covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the
time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the return is
required to be filed.
§ 82-6. Failure to submit acceptable return.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory to the
Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same is
required by notice from him or her, or if no return is made for any period, the Treasurer shall
determine the amount of tax due from such information as he or she is able to obtain, and if
necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or otherwise. He or she shall give
notice of such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and
irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after
the giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Treasurer for a hearing, or unless the
Treasurer of his or her own motion shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the Treasurer shall
give notice of his or her decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law of the State of New York, if application
therefor is made within 90 days after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such
decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest
and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Treasurer and an undertaking filed
with him or her, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the Supreme Court shall
approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant will
pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at the
option of the applicant such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest,
penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay
such tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no
assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the
date of the filing of a return, provided, however, that, where no return has been filed as required by
this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 82-7. Giving of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may be given by mailing the same
to the person for whom it is intended, in a postpaid envelope, addressed to such person or persons at
the address given in the last return filed by such person or persons under this article, or, if no return
has been filed, then to such address as may be obtained from existing directories or records. The
mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person or
persons to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this
article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 82-8. Penalties for offenses.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or any portion thereof within the
time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of
such tax for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such return was
required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Treasurer, for causes shown, may extend the time

for filing any return and, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the
penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 82-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof shall make application for
a refund thereof and the Treasurer or the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion
thereof was erroneously or illegally collected, the Treasurer shall refund the amount so determined.
For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the Treasurer.
However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer
as hereinbefore provided unless the Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his or
her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law of the State of New York that such determination was
erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An application
for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of any tax
or penalty complained of and the Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After
making his or her determination, the Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
he or she shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the
provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 82-10. Tax to be part of operating cost.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and shall not be
added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others but shall constitute a
part of the operating cost of such utility.
§ 82-11. Action to enforce payment.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this article, the Village Attorney
shall, upon the request of the Treasurer, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The
proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Treasurer. Each such tax
and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the same, in the same manner
and to the same extent that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 82-12. Village Treasurer to make rules; subpoena.
In the administration of this article, the Treasurer shall have power to make such reasonable rules and
regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for the exercise of his or her powers and
the performance of his or her duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony and proofs, under oath, with
reference to any matter within the line of his or her official duty under this article, and to subpoena and
require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.
§ 82-13. Confidentiality; penalty for violation.
Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be
unlawful for the Treasurer, or any agent, clerk or employee of the Village of Albion, to divulge or
make known in any manner the amount of gross income or gross operating income or any
particulars set forth or disclosed in any return under this article. The officer charged with the
custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything
contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Village of

Allowances may be made for sheeting, de-watering and other similar actions to complete the
work. Roads, sidewalks and curbs shall be cut, by sawing, before trench excavation is
initiated.
Under ordinary conditions, excavation shall be by open cut from the ground surface. However,
tunneling or boring under structures other than buildings may be required. Such structures include
crosswalks, curbs, gutters, pavements, trees, driveways and railroad tracks.
Open trenches shall be protected at all hours of the day with barricades, as required.
When the work is in progress, trenches shall not be open for more than 30 feet in advance of pipe
installation nor left unfilled for more than 30 feet in the rear of the installed pipe without permission
of the Superintendent. When work is not in progress, including overnight, weekends and holidays,
the trench shall be backfilled to ground surface.
The trench shall be excavated approximately six inches deeper than the final pipe grade. When
unsuitable soils are encountered, these shall be excavated and replaced with select materials.
Ledge rock, boulders and large stones shall be removed from the trench sides and bottom. The
trench shall be over excavated at least 12 inches for five feet, at the transition from rock bottom to
earth bottom, centered on the transition.
Maintenance of grade, elevation and alignment shall be done by some suitable method or
combination of methods.
No structure shall be undercut, unless specifically approved by the Superintendent.
Proper devices shall be provided and maintained operational at all times to remove all water from
the trench as it enters. At no time shall the sewer line be used for removal of water from the
trench.
To protect workers and to prevent caving, shoring and sheeting shall be used, as needed. Caving
shall not be used to backfill the trench. Sheeting shall not be removed, but cut off no lower than
one foot above the pipe crown nor no higher than one foot below final grade, and left in the trench
during backfill operations.

Manholes which extend above grade shall not have an eccentric top section. The top plate shall
be large enough to accommodate the cover lifting device and the cover.
The elevation of the top section shall be such that the cover frame the top elevation is zero and
five-tenths (0.5) feet above the one-hundred-year-flood elevation (in a field), zero and five-tenths
(0.5) feet above a lawn elevation or at finished road or sidewalk grade.
When located in a traveled area (road or sidewalk), the manhole frame and cover shall be heavyduty
cast iron. When located in a lawn or in a field, the manhole frame and cover may be light-duty
cast iron. The cover shall be 24 inches in diameter. The minimum combined weight of the heavy
duty frame and the cover shall be 735 pounds, plus or minus five percent (+/- 5%). The minimum
combined weight of the light duty frame and the cover shall be 420 pounds, plus or minus five
percent (+/- 5%). The mating surfaces shall be machined and painted with tar pitch varnish. The
cover shall not rock in the frame. Infiltration between the cover and frame shall be prevented by
proper design and painting. Covers shall have "Sanitary Sewer" cast into them. Covers shall have
lifting holes suitable for any lifting/jacking device. The lifting holes shall be designed so that
infiltration is prevented.
A drop of at least one-tenth (0.1) foot shall be provided between incoming and outgoing sewers on
all junction manholes and on manholes with bends greater than 45°.
Inverts and shelves/benches shall be placed after testing the manholes and sewers.
Benches shall be level and slope to the flow channel at about one inch per foot.
The minimum depth of the flow channel shall be the nominal diameter of the smaller pipe. The
channel shall have a steel trowel finish. The flow channel shall have a smooth curvature from inlet
to outlet.
Manhole frames, installed at grade, shall be set in a full bed of mortar with no less than two nor
more than four courses of brick underneath to allow for later elevation adjustment. In lieu of brick,
grade rings may be used for elevation adjustment. Grade rings shall not exceed six inches in
depth. The total number of grade rings shall not exceed 12 inches in height, however, in no event
shall more than three grade rings be used.
Manholes which extend above grade shall have the frames cast into the manhole top plate. The
top plate shall be securely anchored to the manhole barrel by a minimum of six one-half-inch
corrosion-resistant anchor bolts to prevent overturning when the cover is removed. The anchor
bolts shall be electrically isolated from the manhole frame and cover.
Internal drop pipes and fittings shall be PVC plastic sewer pipe in compliance with ASTM D-2241.
Corrosion-resistant anchors shall be used to attach the drop pipe to the inside surface of the
manhole barrel.
§ 112-36. Testing.
Infiltration/exfiltration testing. All sanitary sewers or extensions to sanitary sewers, including
manholes, shall satisfy requirements of a final infiltration test before they will be approved and
wastewater flow permitted by the Village of Albion. The infiltration rate shall not exceed 25 gallons
per 24 hours per mile per nominal diameter in inches. An exfiltration test may be substituted for
the infiltration test; the same rate shall not be exceeded. The exfiltration test shall be performed by
the applicant, under the supervision of the Superintendent, who shall have the responsibility for
making proper and accurate measurements required. The exfiltration test consists of filling the
pipe with water to provide a head of at least five feet above the top of the pipe or five feet above
groundwater, whichever is higher, at the highest point under test, and then measuring the loss of
water, from the pipe section under test, by the amount of water which must be added to maintain

the original level. However, under no circumstances shall the head at the downstream manhole
exceed 10 feet or fill to within six inches of the top of the downstream manhole. Should this
condition prevail, the testing methods in § 112-36F and/or G shall be utilized. In this test, the test
section must remain filled with water for at least 24 hours prior to taking any measurements.
Exfiltration shall be measured by the drop of water level in a standpipe with a closed bottom end
or in one of the sewer manholes serving the test section. When a standpipe and plug arrangement
is used in the upper manhole in the test section, there shall be some positive method for releasing
entrapped air prior to taking any measurements.
Test section. The test section shall be as ordered or as approved, but in no event longer than
1,000 feet. In the case of sewers laid on steep grades, the test length may be limited by the
maximum allowable internal pressure on the pipe and joints at the lower end of the test section.
For purposes of determining the leakage rate of the test section, manholes shall be considered as
sections of forty-eight-inch diameter pipe, five feet long. The maximum allowable leakage rate for
such a section is 1.1 gallons per 24 hours. If leakage exceeds the allowable rate, then necessary
repairs or replacements shall be made and the section retested.
Test period. The test period during which the test measurements are taken shall not be less than
two hours.
Pipe lamping. Prior to testing, the section shall be lamped. Any length of pipe out of straight
alignment shall be realigned.
Deflection testing. Also prior to testing, all plastic pipe in the test section shall be tested for
deflection. Deflection testing shall involve the pulling of a rigid ball or mandrel, whose diameter is
95% of the pipe inside diameter, through the pipe. Any length of pipe with a deflection greater than
5% shall be replaced. The test section shall be flushed just prior to deflection testing. The test
shall not be performed with a mechanical pulling device.
Low-pressure air testing alternative.
In lieu of hydrostatic testing (exfiltration or infiltration), low-pressure air testing may be
employed. Low-pressure air tests shall conform to ASTM Specification C-828. All sections to
be tested shall be cleaned and flushed and shall have been backfilled prior to testing. Air shall
be added until the internal pressure of the test section is raised to approximately four point
zero (4.0) psig. The air pressure test shall be based on the time, measured in seconds, for the
air pressure to drop from three point five (3.5) psig to two point five (2.5) psig.
Acceptance is based on limits tabulated in the Specification Time Required for a 1.0 PSIG
Pressure Drop in the Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association's Recommended Practice For Low-
Pressure Air Testing of Installed Sewer Pipe.
Before pressure is applied to the line, all connections shall be firmly plugged. Before the test
period starts, the air shall be given sufficient time to cool to ambient temperature in the test
section.
If the test section is below groundwater, the test pressure shall be increased an amount
sufficient to compensate for groundwater hydrostatic pressure; however, the test pressure
shall not exceed 10 psi.
The pressure test gauge shall have been recently calibrated, and a copy of the calibration
results shall be made available to the Superintendent prior to testing.
Vacuum testing alternative.
In lieu of hydrostatic testing (exfiltration or infiltration), vacuum testing may be employed for
testing of sewer lines and manholes. Sewer lines and manholes shall be tested separately. All
sewer lines to be tested shall be cleaned and flushed and shall have been backfilled prior to

testing. The vacuum test shall be based on the time, measured in seconds, for the vacuum to
decrease from 10 inches of mercury to nine inches of mercury for manholes, and from seven
inches of mercury to six inches of mercury for sewers. Acceptance of manholes is based on
the following:
Manhole Depth
(feet)
Manhole Diameter
(feet)
Time to Drop 1 Inch of Mercury
(from 10 to to 9 inches)
(seconds)
10 or less 4 120
10 to 15 4 150
15 to 25 4 180
For five-foot diameter manholes, add 30 seconds to the times above. For six-foot diameter
manholes, add 60 seconds to the times above.
If the test on the manhole fails (the time is less than that tabulated above), necessary repairs
shall be made and the vacuum test repeated, until the manhole passes the test.
Acceptance of sewers [seven inches of mercury (Hg) to six inches of mercury (Hg)] is based
on the time tabulated in the Specification Time Required for a 0.5 PSIG Pressure Drop in the
Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association's Recommended Practice For Low-Pressure Air Testing of
Installed Sewer Pipe.
The vacuum test gauge shall have been recently calibrated, and a copy of the calibration
results shall be made available to the Superintendent prior to testing.

the test, water shall be added, as needed, to maintain the test pressure. The amount of water
added shall be recorded so as to calculate leakage. Leakage shall not exceed 25 gallons per day
per mile per inch nominal pipe diameter. During the test, the owner and the Superintendent shall
walk the route of the force main and examine the exposed pipe and the ground covering any
backfilled pipe to discover leaks. Leakage in excess of that specified above shall be corrected with
new material at the owner's expense and the test repeated. Any observed leaks shall be repaired
at the owner's expense.

§ 112-42. Sewer lateral permits; fee.
There shall be two classes of sewer lateral permits:
Residential, commercial and institutional service.
Service to establishments producing industrial wastes.
In either case, a permit application shall be submitted to the Superintendent. The permit
application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered
pertinent, in the judgment of the Superintendent. A fee, established by § 112-123, shall
accompany the application.
§ 112-43. New building laterals.
A separate and independent building lateral shall be provided for every building requiring sanitary
facilities. When, however, there is a building behind a front building, the second building may use
the front building's building lateral, if there is no other way to provide sanitary service to the back
building.
New street laterals and/or building laterals shall not go under building basements. In like fashion, a
building shall not be constructed over an existing lateral; the lateral shall be relocated after the
Superintendent has approved plans showing the relocation. If relocation is not physically possible,
then the lateral shall be:
Exposed and totally encapsulated in not less than three inches of concrete; or
Exposed and walled and the building rooms above positively ventilated outdoors.
All existing manholes in or under the basement shall be sealed air-tight in a manner acceptable to
the Superintendent. No new manholes shall be constructed on the portion of the lateral under the

Dry sewers shall be designed and installed in accordance to this chapter.
§ 112-47. Existing building laterals.
Existing building laterals may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on
examination by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this chapter.
§ 112-48. Lateral pipe materials.
Building and street lateral pipe materials shall be one of the following:
Tar-coated, service grade, cast-iron soil pipe conforming to ASTM Specification A-74, Castiron
Pipe and Fittings. All dimensions, weight and markings of the pipe shall conform to the
requirements of ANSI, Designation A-112.5.1, except spigot ends shall be plain end, if gasket
joints are used.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and fittings conforming to ASTM Specification D-3034-73, SDR-
35 Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Sewer Pipe and Fittings. All pipe shall be suitable for gravity
sewer service. Provisions shall be made for contraction and expansion at each joint with a
rubber ring. The bell shall consist of an integral wall section stiffened with two PVC retainer
rings which securely lock the solid cross-section ring into position. Minimum pipe stiffness
(F/Y) at five-percent deflection shall be 46 psi when tested in accordance with ASTM
Specification D-2412.
Any part of the building or street lateral that is located within five feet of a water main or water
service shall be constructed of cast-iron soil pipe. Cast-iron soil pipe may be required by the
Superintendent where the building or street lateral is likely to be damaged by tree roots. If installed
on fill or unstable ground, the building or street lateral shall be of cast-iron soil pipe, although other
pipe material may be permitted if such pipe is uniformly supported on a poured concrete cradle
approved by the Superintendent. The distance between consecutive joints, as measured along the
center line of the installed pipe, shall not be less than 10 feet, except under abnormal
circumstances, in which case this dimension may be diminished, if approved by the
Superintendent. The size and slope of building and street laterals shall be subject to approval by
the Superintendent, but in no event shall the internal pipe diameter be less than four inches, nor
shall the pipe slope be less than one-fourth (1/4) inch per foot.
§ 112-49. Street lateral to public sewer connection.
At the point of connection of a street lateral to a main sewer, a standard Y-fitting and sufficient oneeighth-
bend (forty-five-degree) fittings shall be used. The Y-fittings shall be installed so that flow in the
arm shall transition smoothly into the flow in the public sewer. No lateral connection shall be made to
the public sewer which permits the flow into the public sewer from the lateral to enter at right angles.
§ 112-50. Future connection locations; as-built drawings.
The street lateral, including the Y- and one-eighth-bend fittings, shall be connected to the main sewer
at the time of constructing the main sewer, for each proposed lot for either immediate or future
development. Laterals installed for future development shall be fitted a standard plug approved for use
by the Superintendent. All sewer connections shall be via a properly installed saddle on the main
sewer pipe. No portion of the lateral pipe shall protrude into the main sewer pipe. The location of all
lateral connections shall be field marked with a two-by-six-inch corrosion- and rot-resistant board. The
marker board shall extend from the depth of the lateral to a minimum of two feet above grade. The
location of all lateral connections shall be indicated on a drawing, and four copies of this drawing,

showing the as-built location of these connections, shall be furnished to the Superintendent. A
refundable deposit shall be placed with Village of Albion to assure receipt of these as-builts. The
deposit shall be placed when application is made; the amount of the deposit shall be $100 per sheet of
plans showing locations of lateral connections. No sanitary sewer shall be accepted by Village of
Albion until four copies of this record drawing have been so filed with the Superintendent and the
Superintendent has approved the submitted drawings.
§ 112-51. Special institution manhole requirements.
When any street lateral is to serve a school, hospital or similar institution or public housing or is to
serve a complex of industrial or commercial buildings or, in the opinion of the Superintendent, will
receive wastewater or industrial wastes of such volume or character that frequent maintenance of said
building or street lateral is anticipated, then such street lateral shall be connected to the public sewer
through a manhole. The Superintendent shall determine if and where this type of connection to the
public sewer is required. Connections to existing manholes shall be made as directed by the
Superintendent. If required, a new manhole shall be installed in the public sewer pursuant to §§ 112-35
and 112-94, and the lateral connection made thereto as directed by the Superintendent.
§ 112-52. Laterals at and near buildings.
Whenever possible, the building lateral shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the
basement floor. Building laterals laid parallel to a bearing wall shall not be installed closer than three
feet to such wall. The building lateral shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as
possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Changes of
direction of 90° or greater shall be made with a cleanout which extends to grade, terminating in a
terminal box set in concrete. The ends of all building or street laterals which are not connected to the
interior plumbing of the building for any reason shall be sealed against infiltration by a suitable stopper,
plug or by other approved means.
§ 112-53. Sewage lifting.
In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
wastewater carried by such drain shall be lifted by mechanical means and discharged to the building
lateral, on approval of the Superintendent.
§ 112-54. Lateral pipe installation.
All excavations required for the installation of a building or street lateral shall be open trench work
unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent. Pipelaying and backfilling, regardless of pipe
material used, shall be performed in general accordance with Paragraphs 3 through 6 of ASTM
Specification C-12, except that trench width, measured at the top of the installed pipe, shall not exceed
the outside pipe diameter plus 14 inches and except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has
been inspected. The depth of cover over the pipe shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, but
in any case such depth shall not be less than four feet.
§ 112-55. Joints.
Watertight joints. All joints and connections shall be made watertight.
Cast-iron pipe poured joints. Poured joints for cast-iron pipe shall be firmly packed with oakum or
hemp, and the annulus filled with an approved compound not less than one inch deep. Said

compound shall be run in with a single pouring and caulked tight, if appropriate for the compound
used. No paint, varnish or other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the
joint has been tested and approved. The transition joint between cast-iron pipe and other pipe
materials shall be made with special adapters and jointing materials approved by the
Superintendent. If such joints are hot-poured, the material shall not soften sufficiently to destroy
the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of 160° F., nor be soluble in any of
the wastes carried by the lateral.
Cast-iron push joints. Premolded gaskets may be used for hub and plain end cast-iron pipe joints
and joints with fittings, if approved by the Superintendent. The gasket shall be a neoprene
compression-type unit which provides a positive seal in the assembled joint. The gasket shall be a
premolded, one-piece unit, designed for joining the cast-iron hub and plain-end soil pipe and
fittings. The assembled joint shall be sealed by compression of the gasket between the exterior
surface of the spigot and the interior surface of the hub. The joint shall be assembled following the
manufacturer's recommendations using acceptable lubricant and special pipe-coupling tools
designed for that purpose. The plain spigot end shall be forced into the hub end of the pipe for the
full depth of the hub itself. Lubricant shall be a bland, flax-base, nontoxic material and shall not
chemically attack the gasket material.
PVC push joints. Joints for PVC sewer pipe shall follow the manufacturer's recommendations,
using properly designed couplings and rubber gaskets pursuant to the published information
relating thereto, and conforming to the applicable ASTM specification identified in § 112-48.
§ 112-56. Street laterals.
Building lateral/street lateral connection.
The connection of the building lateral to an existing street lateral shall be made at the property
line. Except as provided under §§ 112-30 and 112-31, if a lateral has not previously been
provided, the lateral will be constructed from the existing public sewer at the owner's
expense. The street lateral shall be installed with a properly sealed and covered cleanout to
grade located at the property line. The cleanout shall terminate in a metal box imbedded in
concrete.
The cost of constructing the lateral from the existing public sewer shall be at the property
owner's expense; all subsequent costs and expense incidental to the installation and
connection of the building lateral shall also be borne by the owner.
The property owner shall indemnify the Village of Albion from any loss or damage that may
directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building lateral.
It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain, repair or replace the building
lateral, as needed.
The method of connection of the building lateral will be dependent upon the type of sewer
pipe material and, in all cases, shall be approved by the Superintendent.
Cleanout repair and replacement. If, in the judgment of the Superintendent, it is determined that a
building lateral without a property line cleanout needs repair or replacement, the Superintendent
may require a cleanout at the property line, at the property owner's expense, such that the street
lateral can be maintained independently of the building lateral.
Street lateral replacement; expenses. Any existing street lateral which, upon examination by the
Superintendent, is determined to be in need of replacement will be replaced with a new street
lateral with a property line cleanout. The cost of constructing the replacement street lateral and
cleanout shall be at the property owner's expense.

lateral is ready for inspection and connection is to be made to the street lateral. The connection
shall be made under the supervision of the Superintendent.
The applicant for the street lateral permit shall notify the Superintendent when the street lateral is
ready for inspection and connection is to be made to the main sewer. The connection shall be
made under the supervision of the Superintendent.
§ 112-59. Trench inspections.
When trenches are excavated for the laying of building lateral pipes or for laying of street lateral pipes,
such trenches shall be inspected by the Superintendent. Before the trenches are backfilled, the person
performing such work shall notify the Superintendent when the laying of the building lateral is
completed, and no backfilling of trenches shall begin until approval is obtained from the
Superintendent.
§ 112-60. Public protection; restoration of public property.
All excavations for constructing building laterals shall be adequately protected with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property
disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent.
When installation requires disturbance of paved public roads and shoulders, restoration shall involve
backfilling to road grade. Shortly thereafter, the Village of Albion Department of Public Works (DPW)
shall complete road and shoulder restoration to the Village of Albion standards. The cost for such final
road and shoulder restoration by the Department of Public Works shall be included with the fees paid
with the application for the permit required in § 112-42.
§ 112-61. Interior cleanout.
An interior cleanout fitting shall be provided for each building lateral at a readily accessible location,
preferably just inside the basement wall. The fitting shall contain a forty-five-degree branch with
removable plug or test tee, and be so positioned that sewer cleaning equipment can be inserted
therein to clean the building lateral. The cleanout diameter shall be no less than the building lateral
diameter.
§ 112-62. Costs to be borne by owner; indemnification.

occasioned by the installation of the building and street laterals and connections and appurtenances.
Article VII. Inflow
§ 112-63. New sources prohibited.
No connections shall be made to a sanitary or to a combined sewer which connections are intended to
discharge inflow. Such prohibited connections include, but are not limited to, footing drains, roof
leaders, roof drains, cellar drains, sump pumps, catch basins, uncontaminated cooling water
discharges or other sources of inflow.
§ 112-64. Existing sources disconnected.
For properties where separate storm sewers are available (and capable of handling flows as
determined by the Superintendent) within 100 feet of the property line or where, in the judgment of the
Superintendent, sufficient natural drainage is available, connections which contribute inflow to the
sanitary sewers must be disconnected in a fashion approved by the Superintendent, prior to the sale of
the property.
§ 112-65. Disconnection of sources.
Upon notice from the Tax Assessor, the Code Enforcement Officer shall inspect any newly sold
property for the purpose of determining if storm sewers or natural drainage is available and, if so, if all

Determination.
To assure that none of the above noted limitations are violated, the Superintendent shall issue
permits to significant industrial users limiting the discharge of the substances noted above.
Each permit shall restrict the discharge from each significant industrial user to a portion of the
total allowable influent loading. In determining what portion of the total of each substance that
each significant industrial user shall be allowed to discharge, the Superintendent shall
consider:
The quantities of each substance that are uncontrollable because they occur naturally in
wastewater;
The quantities of each substance that are anthropogenic but are nonetheless
uncontrollable;
Historical discharge trends;
Past pollution control efforts of each significant industrial user as compared to other
significant industrial dischargers of the same substance;
Potential for growth in the JMIPCF service area;
Potential for more restrictive regulatory requirements to be placed on the JMIPCF
discharge or sludge disposal or sludge reuse method; and
Treatability of the substance.
The Superintendent shall apply a minimum fifteen-percent safety factor to be protective of the
JMIPCF.
Permits issued in accordance with this section may allow for discharges in excess of limitations
set forth under § 112-73.
§ 112-76. Modification of limitations.
Limitations on wastewater strength or mass discharge contained in this chapter may be
supplemented with more stringent limitations when, in the opinion of the Superintendent:
The limitations in this chapter are not sufficient to protect the JMIPCF;

permit;
The JMIPCF sludge will be rendered unacceptable for disposal or reuse as the Village of
Albion desires, as a result of discharge of wastewaters at the above prescribed concentration
limitations;
Municipal employees or the public will be endangered; or
Air pollution and/or groundwater pollution will be caused.
The limitations on wastewater strength or mass discharge shall be recalculated not less frequently
than once every five years. The results of these calculations shall be reported to the Village of
Albion Board. This chapter shall then be amended appropriately. Any issued industrial wastewater
discharge permits which have limitations based directly on any limitations of this chapter, which
limitations were changed, shall be revised and amended, as appropriate.
§ 112-77. Dilution.
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard, no user shall ever
increase the use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard.
Dilution flow shall be considered to be inflow.
§ 112-78. Grease, oil and sand interceptors.
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of
grease, flammable substances, sand or other harmful substances; except that such interceptors
shall not be required for private living quarters or living units.
All restaurants and food preparation establishments shall be required to install grease/oil
interceptors and any existing restaurants and food preparation establishments shall install
grease/oil interceptors upon transfer of ownership.
All interceptors shall be of type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be so
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner, at his/her expense.

Superintendent the information required by § 112-84A(8) and (9).
Ninety-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of
the introduction of wastewater into the JMIPCF, any user subject to pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the Superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration
of all pollutants in the discharge, from the regulated process, which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements, and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in
the user's facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards and requirements. The report
shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement
shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified
professional.
Periodic compliance reports.
Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the
JMIPCF, shall submit to the Superintendent during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Superintendent, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which,
during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow reported in § 112-84. At the
discretion of the Superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow
rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Superintendent may agree to alter the months during
which the above reports are to be submitted, however, no fewer than two reports shall be
submitted per year.
The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of
mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by Subsection D(1) above
shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the
user. These reports shall contain the results of discharge sampling and analysis, including the
flow, and the nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the
Superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standard. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with standard methods
and by a laboratory certified by New York State Department of Health to perform the
analyses.
Violation report. If sampling performed by the user indicates a violation of this chapter and/or the
user's discharge permit, the user shall notify the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results
of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
The user is not required to resample if the JMIPCF performs monitoring of the user's discharge at
least once a month for the parameter which was violated or if the JMIPCF performs sampling for
the parameter which was violated between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives
the results of this sampling.
Other reports. The Superintendent may impose reporting requirements equivalent to the
requirements imposed by Subsection D above for users not subject to pretreatment standards.
§ 112-93. Slug discharge prohibited; flow equalization.

storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty-four-hour period. The
facility shall have a capacity for at least 50% of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with
alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the
Superintendent. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
§ 112-94. Monitoring stations.
All significant industrial users and other industrial users whose industrial waste discharge has
caused or may cause interference or pass-through shall install and maintain a suitable monitoring
station, on their premises at their expense, to facilitate the observation, sampling and
measurement of their industrial wastewater discharge.
If there is more than one street lateral serving an industrial user, the Superintendent may require
the installation of a control manhole on each lateral.
The Superintendent may require that such monitoring station(s) include equipment for the
continuous measurement and recording of wastewater flow rate and for the sampling of the
wastewater. Such station(s) shall be accessibly and safely located, and the industrial user shall
allow immediate access, without prior notice, to the station by the Superintendent or his/her
designated representative.
§ 112-95. Design and maintenance of monitoring stations.
Preliminary treatment and flow equalization facilities or monitoring stations, if provided for any
wastewater, shall be constructed and maintained continuously clean, safe and continuously operational
by the owner at his/her expense. Where an industrial user has such treatment, equalization or
monitoring facilities at the time this chapter is enacted, the Superintendent may approve or disapprove
the adequacy of such facilities. Where the Superintendent disapproves of such facilities and
construction of new or upgraded facilities for treatment, equalization or monitoring are required, plans
and specifications for such facilities shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and
submitted to the Superintendent. Construction of new or upgraded facilities shall not commence until
written approval of the Superintendent has been obtained.
§ 112-96. Vandalism.
No unauthorized person shall negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with,
prevent access or render inaccurate or cause or permit the negligent breaking, damaging, destroying,
uncovering, defacing, tampering with, preventing access or rendering inaccurate to:
Any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the Village of Albion JMIPCF, or
Any measuring, sampling and/or testing device or mechanism installed pursuant to any
requirement under this chapter, except as approved by the Superintendent.
§ 112-97. Sampling and analysis.
Sampling shall be performed so that a representative portion of the wastewater is obtained for
analysis.
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes required in any
section of this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with standard methods and by a
laboratory certified by New York State Department of Health to perform the analyses. Such
samples shall be taken at the approved monitoring stations described in § 112-94, if such a station

exists. If an approved monitoring station is not required, then samples shall be taken from another
location on the industrial sewer lateral before discharge to the public sewer. Unless specifically
requested otherwise, or unless specifically not allowed in federal regulation, samples shall be
gathered as flow proportioned (where feasible) composite samples made up of individual samples
taken not less than once per hour for the period of time equal to the duration of industrial
wastewater discharge during daily operations (including any cleanup shift).
§ 112-98. Accidental discharges.
Each user shall provide for protection from accidental or slug discharges of prohibited materials or
discharges of materials in volume or concentration exceeding limitations of this chapter or of an
industrial wastewater discharge permit. Users shall immediately notify the Superintendent of the
discharge of wastes in violation of this chapter or any permit. Such discharges may result from:
Breakdown of pretreatment equipment.
Accidents caused by mechanical failure or negligence.
Other causes.
Where possible, such immediate notification shall allow the Superintendent to initiate appropriate
countermeasure action at the JMIPCF. The user shall prepare a detailed written statement
following any accidental or slug discharge, which describes the causes of the discharge and the
measures being taken to prevent future occurrences, within five days of the occurrence, and the
Superintendent shall receive a copy of such report no later than the fifth calendar day following the
occurrence. Analytical results and their interpretation may be appended to the report at a date not
exceeding 45 calendar days after the occurrence.
When required by the Superintendent, detailed plans and procedures to prevent accidental or slug
discharges shall be submitted to the Superintendent for approval. These plans and procedures
shall be called a "Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan." The plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
Description of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying the JMIPCF of any accidental or slug discharge. Such
notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any provision of the
permit and any National Prohibitive Discharge Standard;
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
Posting notices. In order that the industrial user's employees be informed of the Village of Albion
requirements, a notice shall be permanently posted on appropriate bulletin boards within the
user's facility advising employees of the Village of Albion requirements and whom to call in case of
an accidental discharge in violation of this chapter.

In determining the amount of civil penalty, the court shall take into account all relative
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other relative factors as justice
may require.
Such civil penalty may be released or compromised by the Superintendent before the matter

competent jurisdiction giving precedence to courts local to the Village of Albion.
The Village of Albion Attorney, at the request of the Superintendent, shall petition the court to

Class A misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than
$1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
No prosecution under this section shall be instituted until after final disposition of a show
cause hearing, if any, was instituted.
Additional injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of
this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, the Superintendent, through counsel, may
petition the court, in the name of the Village of Albion, for the issuance of a preliminary or
permanent injunction, or both (as may be appropriate), which restrains the violation of or compels
the compliance with any order or determination thereunder by the Superintendent.
Summary abatement.
Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this chapter, whenever the Superintendent
finds, after investigation, that any user is causing, engaging in or maintaining a condition or
activity which, in the judgment of the Superintendent, presents an imminent danger to the
public health, safety or welfare or to the environment or is likely to result in severe damage to
the JMIPCF or the environment, it therefore appears to be prejudicial to the public interest to
allow the condition or activity to go unabated until notice and an opportunity for a hearing can
be provided, the Superintendent may, without prior hearing, order such user by notice, in
writing, wherever practicable or in such other form as practices are intended to be proscribed,
to discontinue, abate or alleviate such condition or activity, and thereupon such person shall
immediately discontinue, abate or alleviate such condition or activity; or where the giving of
notice is impracticable, or in the event of a user's failure to comply voluntarily with an
emergency order, the Superintendent may take all appropriate action to abate the violating
condition. As promptly as possible thereafter, not to exceed 15 calendar days, the
Superintendent shall provide the user an opportunity to be heard, in accordance with the
provisions of this Article.
If the user is not within the geographic boundaries of the Village of Albion, the right of
summary abatement to discontinue, abate or alleviate conditions or activities shall be those
prescribed in the inter-municipal agreement.
The Superintendent, acting upon the belief that an emergency exists, shall be indemnified
against any personal liability that may arise in the performance of his/her duties to protect the
public health, safety or welfare or to preserve the JMIPCF or the environment.

penalty equal to 10% of the original bill.
In the event that there are any sewer taxes, assessments or other service charges which shall

located to add the amount of the sewer assessment or other charges which shall be in default,
plus penalty and interest, as provided for in the law, to the real property taxes due to the county in
the next ensuing year.

with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the JMIPCF, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the
Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
§ 112-118. Liability insurance.
The Superintendent may decline to reissue a permit to any user which has failed to comply with the

caused by its discharge.
§ 112-119. Informant rewards.
The Superintendent is authorized to pay up to $500 for information leading to the discovery of
noncompliance by a user. In the event that the information provided results in an administrative fine or
civil penalty levied against the user, the Superintendent is authorized to disperse up to 10% of the
collected fine or penalty to the informant. However, a single reward payment may not exceed $10,000,

establish a percentage of the total metered water to be used as a basis for such computations or direct
the installation of appropriate flow measuring (and totalizing) devices to measure and record the actual
amount of flow into the JMIPCF. In the event that a person discharging wastes into the JMIPCF
procures all or part of his/her water supply from unmetered sources, the Superintendent shall either
direct the installation of water meters on the other sources of water supply or direct the installation of
appropriate flow measuring devices to measure and record the actual amount of flow into the JMIPCF.
Any water meters and/or flow measuring devices installed pursuant to this section shall be of a type
and design acceptable to the Superintendent and shall be installed, maintained and periodically tested
as required by the Superintendent, at the owner's expense. All such meters and/or flow measuring
devices shall be subject to periodic inspection, testing and reading by the Superintendent. Any person
discharging wastes into the JMIPCF may install a flow measuring device at his/her option, of the type,
design, installation and maintenance standards of the Superintendent, at the owner's expense.

[1] Editor's Note: This local law superseded former Ch. 121, Abandoned, Junked, Discarded an
Unregistered Motor Vehicles, adopted 11-14-2001 by L.L. No. 10-2001.
§ 121-1. Statement of purpose.
The outdoor storage of abandoned, junked, discarded and unregistered motor vehicles on privately
owned property within the Village of Albion is detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of
the community. The same also constitutes an attractive nuisance to children and in many ways imperils
their safety. Such storage also endangers the person and property of members of the community,
since fuel tanks containing gasoline or gasoline fumes may easily explode. Such storage is unsightly
and depreciates property values. The control of the outdoor storage of abandoned, junked, discarded
and unregistered motor vehicles on privately owned properties within the Village of Albion is therefore
regulated for the preservation of the health, safety and general welfare of the community.
§ 121-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

limited to any one of the following: the physical condition of the motor vehicle, any statements as
to its abandonment, the length of time since the motor vehicle was last used on the public
highways, whether the motor vehicle is inspected, and whether the motor vehicle is currently
registered. With respect to a motor vehicle not required to be registered or motor vehicles not
usually used on public highways, the intent of the owner shall be determined by the physical
condition of the motor vehicle, the length of time since it was last used for the purposes intended
and any statements as to its abandonment, and other relevant facts.

Chapter 124. Alarm Devices
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Albion at time of adoption of Code 8-14-
1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I. Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 124-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Alarm Permit Law."
§ 124-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the Village of Albion by reducing the number of avoidable alarms to emergency agencies.
Avoidable alarms contribute to ineffective utilization of public safety manpower and equipment. In
addition, avoidable alarms require emergency responses which may contribute to a high accident rate
and delayed responses to genuine emergencies. This chapter seeks to ensure that communication
facilities will be available to dispatch personnel for actual emergencies and to alleviate the nuisance of
audible alarms to the surrounding community. Another purpose of this chapter is to contact responsible
people to notify them of the activation of the alarm. This chapter also requires registration of alarm
businesses and subscribers for the purpose of permitting the village to communicate with them
regarding the administration of this chapter.
§ 124-3. Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases shall be construed herein as set forth in
this section, unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended:
ALARM AGENT
Any person who is employed by an alarm business, either directly or indirectly, whose duties
include any of the following: selling, maintaining, leasing, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing,
moving or installing on or in any building, structure or facility any alarm system. The provisions of
this chapter shall not apply to a person who engages in the manufacture or sale of an alarm

system from a fixed location and who neither visits the location where the alarm system is to be
installed nor designs the scheme for physical location and installation of the fire alarm system in a
specific location.
ALARM BUSINESS
The business by any individual, partnership, corporation or other entity of selling, leasing,
maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving or installing any alarm system or
causing to be sold, leased, maintained, serviced, repaired, altered, replaced, moved or installed
any alarm system in or on any building, structure or facility.
ALARM SYSTEM
Any mechanical or electrical device which is designed or used for the detection of fire, smoke or
heat and/or unauthorized entry or intrusion, or attempts thereof, and which emits a sound or
transmits a signal or message when activated. "Alarm systems" include, but are not limited to,
direct dial telephone devices, audible alarms and proprietor alarms. Devices which are not
designed or used to register alarms that are audible, visible or perceptible outside of the protected
building, structure or facility are not included within this definition, nor are auxiliary devices
installed by the telephone company or a cable television company to protect its systems which
might be damaged or disrupted by the use of an alarm system
APPELLANT

APPLICANT
A person, firm or corporation who or which files an application for a new or renewal permit as
provided in this chapter.
AUDIBLE ALARM

AVOIDABLE ALARM
The activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or
the negligence of the owner, user, custodian or lessee of an alarm system, or his or her
employees or agents, or through any other cause which, through direct connection to an
emergency agency or through notification of an emergency agency by a private answering point or
automatic dialing device or through notification to an emergency agency by any other second
party or means, indicates that an emergency situation exists requiring an emergency response
within the Village of Albion when, in fact, an emergency situation does not exist. An "avoidable
alarm" also includes the knowing or intentional activation of an alarm to an emergency agency
when the activator knows that an emergency situation does not exist. "Avoidable alarm" shall not
include alarms activated by violent conditions of nature, such as hurricanes, tornadoes,
earthquakes or any other similar cause beyond the control of the user or installer of an alarm
system; nor does it include an emergency or disaster drill conducted with prior notice to the
emergency agency. Activation of an alarm system under any circumstances in which the activator
reasonably believes that an emergency situation exists is not an "avoidable alarm," subject to the
above exceptions.

§ 132-1. Philadelphia Block System.
7/14/2020 Village of Albion, NY Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/AL0001?guid=AL0001&children=true 128/376
A.
B.
All streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places lying and being within the limits of the Village of
Albion as now laid out and existing, or as may be hereafter laid out, shall be numbered or renumbered
according to the Philadelphia Block System, so-called, modified so as to conform to the uniform
system recommended for use in the State of New York and which has been adapted to the conditions
existing in the said Village of Albion aforesaid.
§ 132-2. Districts and base lines.
The village aforesaid shall be divided into four districts or divisions by the application to the same of
two base lines. One of these shall run north and south along the center line of the thoroughfare known
as Main Street from the north line of the village to the south line of the same as now located and
existing, which base line shall denote the marking of the streets running east and west, and the other
shall run along the center line of the thoroughfares known as East State Street and West State Street,
from the east village line to the west village line as now located and existing, which base line shall
denote the dividing line between the marking of streets running north and south. Therefore, the
intersection of the two base lines referred to, which is in the geometrical center of said intersection of
the two streets named, that is, Main Street and East and West State Streets, is the initial point of the
numbering of the streets in the four directions named.
§ 132-3. Block numbering.
From the base lines as established by § 132-2 hereof, a uniform system of property numbering shall
commence, using 100 numbers, maximum, to each block, in each direction and continuing with a
consecutive hundred at each full intersection, it being the intent and purpose of this method of uniform
system that house numbers are assigned to property frontage in units only and not on the basis of
what is built on the property, applying to vacant property as well as to property that has been improved
by the construction of any structures of any kind upon the same.
§ 132-4. Unit dimensions.
[Amended 8-14-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]
The units of the uniform system as referred to in § 132-3 hereof shall be as follows:
Eighteen feet shall constitute a frontage unit in the business section of the Village of Albion, which,
for the purposes of this Article, shall be the area covered by the area defined by North Main Street
from the Erie Canal south to State Street; South Main Street from Route 31 north to State Street;
East Bank Street from Route 98 east to Ingersoll Street; West Bank Street from Route 98 west to
Liberty Street, so enlarged in all directions as to include the farther sides of the streets, alleys,
lanes, courts and public places and thus give proper effect to the numbering of said farther sides
of the said streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places, as well as to the near sides of same.
Forty feet shall constitute a frontage unit in a residential section of the Village of Albion, which, for
the purposes of this Article, shall be the balance of the area within the confines of the Village of
Albion and lying outside of the area referred to above herein in this section.
§ 132-5. Property numbering.
The numbering and renumbering shall be so made, assigned and placed that the odd numbers shall
be on the north side of the east and west streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places and on the
east side of the north and south streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places. Likewise, the even
numbers shall be on the south side of the east and west streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places
and on the west side of the north and south streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places.

§ 132-6. District designations in address.
All streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places shall have the proper label assigned to the same by
giving the prefix east or west or north or south to the streets, alleys, lanes, courts and public places in
each of the four districts or divisions formed by the base lines aforesaid already designated and
located as provided for in § 132-2 of this Article, thus giving the proper stamp of individuality to each
and every street, alley, lane, court and public place within the limits of the Village of Albion aforesaid.
§ 132-7. Numbering of apartments and other entrances.
All numbering and renumbering shall be so made that no numerical fraction number shall be given
to any unit or part thereof or to any entrance or stairway or stairways leading to apartments in the
rear or in the upper stories of any building or buildings fronting on any street, alley, lane, court or
public place, but such entrance to such stairway or stairways shall be given a number with an
alphabetical suffix, which suffix shall attach to the number or the unit in which said entrance is
located. Thus, if the entrance to such apartment or apartments shall occur in a unit that may carry
the number of 12, then said entrance shall be given the number 12A.
Likewise, where any subdivision or a unit may be made, the alphabetical suffix shall be applied,
and no numerical fractional number be given to any portion.
Article II. Design and Display
[Adopted at time of adoption of Code 8-14-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996[1]]
Editor's Note: See Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.

residences, apartment buildings, businesses and commercial and industrial establishments and
municipal, government and religious buildings (e.g., fire departments, post office, schools, Village Hall,
churches, etc.).
§ 132-10. Location.
In the case where the principal structure is not clearly visible from the street or is back more than 75
feet from the edge of the road right-of-way, a post with the property numbers displayed upon it, not to
exceed five feet in height, shall be installed in close proximity to the property access, not less than five
feet or greater than 25 feet from the edge of the road right-of-way. All numbers must be clearly visible
from the street and unobstructed by shrubs, fences, trees and other objects.
§ 132-11. Design requirements.

https://ecode360.com/print/AL0001?guid=AL0001&children=true 130/376

In the case of new construction, no temporary or final certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the
Code Enforcement Officer verifies that the street numbers have been properly displayed.
§ 132-13. Acts to be considered violations.
The absence of address numbers or the insecure fastening or absence of any whole number thereof or
the use of any number not properly assigned by the village or the failure of address numbers to meet
visibility requirements shall all be considered violations of this Article.
§ 132-14. Determination of compliance.
Any structure having street numbers which are Arabic in design, logical in sequence, within the
distance required, a minimum of four inches in height and of contrasting colors as of the effective date
of this Article shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with this Article.

Address numbers shall be placed on mailboxes at the curb, in a size not less than two inches in height.
§ 132-16. Grant of exemption.
The Code Enforcement Officer is hereby authorized to grant exemptions from the number size
requirement of this section where public safety is not adversely affected.
§ 132-17. Penalties for offenses.
Failure to comply with the property numbering regulations hereby is punishable by a fine not to exceed
$250 or imprisonment not to exceed fifteen days, or both such fine and imprisonment.

personally or by leaving the same at his or her residence with any adult person or, if he or she is a
nonresident of the Village, by mailing the same to him or her at his or her last known place of

In cases of great emergency, where the delay of proceedings as herein before provided would result in
probable loss of life or property, the Board of Trustees shall have the power to proceed at once to take

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards
or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which
are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion of flood
damages.
Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
Qualify and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

A.
This chapter is adopted in response to revisions to the National Flood Insurance Program effective
October 1, 1986, and shall supersede all previous laws adopted for the purpose of establishing
and maintaining eligibility for flood insurance.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum
requirements, adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. Whenever the
requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted
rules, regulations or ordinances, the most restrictive or that imposing the higher standards shall
govern.
§ 165-8. Penalties for offenses.
No structure shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered and no land shall
be excavated or filled without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable
regulations. Any infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its
requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions of the permit, shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more that $250 or
imprisoned for not more than 15 days, or both. Each day of noncompliance shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of Albion from taking such other
lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any structure found not compliant with
the requirements of this chapter for which the developer and/or owner has not applied for and received
an approved variance under §§ 165-16 and 165-17 will be declared noncompliant and notification sent
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
§ 165-9. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur
on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does
not imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Village of
Albion, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
§ 165-10. Local administrator designated.
The Code Enforcement Officer of the Village of Albion is hereby appointed local administrator to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in
accordance with its provisions.
§ 165-11. Development permits.
A development permit shall be obtained before the start of construction or any other development
within the area of special flood hazard as established in § 165-6. Application for a development permit
shall be made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may include, but not be limited to,
plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the
area in question; existing or proposed structures; fill; storage of materials; drainage facilities; and the

the floodway, unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that such encroachments shall not result in
any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
§ 165-16. Appeals Board.
The Village Board of Trustees, as established by the Village of Albion, shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
The Village Board of Trustees shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in
any requirement, decision or determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
Those aggrieved by the decision of the Village Board of Trustees may appeal such decision to the
Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
In passing upon such applications, the village shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding
or erosion damage.
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management
program of that area.
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
The costs to local governments and the danger associated with conducting search and
rescue operations during periods of flooding.
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
search and rescue operations, maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors in Subsection D and the purpose of this chapter, the village may

§ 165-17. Conditions for variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that § 165-16D has been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures and
contributing structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of
Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this chapter.
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and
for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
A showing of good and sufficient cause.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or laws.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor below the base
flood elevation shall be given written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk.

Notice of a proposed designation shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
owner of the property proposed for designation, describing the property and announcing a public
hearing by the Commission to consider the designation. Where the proposed designation involves
so many owners that individual notice is infeasible, notice may instead be published at least once
in a newspaper of general circulation at least 10 days, but no more than 20 days, prior to the date
of the public hearing. Once the Commission has issued notice of a proposed designation, no
building permits shall be issued by the Code Enforcement Officer until the Commission has made
its decision.
[Amended 8-11-2010 by L.L. No. 6-2010; 9-22-2010 by L.L. No. 8-2010]
The Commission shall hold a public hearing prior to designation of any landmark or historic
district. The Commission, owners and any interested parties may present testimony or
documentary evidence at the hearing which will become part of a record regarding the historic,
architectural, or cultural importance of the proposed landmark or historic district. The record may
also contain staff reports, public comments, or other evidence offered outside of the hearing.
The Commission shall forward notice of each property designated as a landmark and the
boundaries of each designated historic district to the office of the Orleans County Clerk for
recordation.
§ 173-4. Certificate of appropriateness for alteration, demolition
or new construction affecting landmarks or historic districts.
No person shall carry out any exterior alteration, restoration, reconstruction, demolition, new
construction, or moving of a landmark or property within an historic district, nor shall any person make
any material change in the appearance of such property, its light fixtures, freestanding lights, signs,
sidewalks, fences, stairs, outbuildings, walls, driveways or alleys, paving or any other exterior element
which affects the appearance and cohesiveness of the landmark or historic district without first
obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Commission.
§ 173-5. Criteria for approval of certificate of appropriateness.
In passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall not consider changes to interior spaces, unless they are open to the public. The
Commission's decision shall be based on the following principles:
Properties which contribute to the character of the historic district shall be retained, with their
historic features altered as little as possible;
Any alteration of existing properties shall be compatible with their historic character, as well as
with the surrounding district; and
New construction shall be compatible with the district in which it is located.
In applying the principle of compatibility, the Commission shall consider the following factors:
The general design, character and appropriateness to the property of the proposed alteration
or new construction;
The scale of proposed alteration or new construction in relation to the property itself,
surrounding properties, and the neighborhood;
Texture, materials, and color and their relation to similar features of other properties in the
neighborhood;

Visual compatibility with surrounding properties, including proportion of the property's front
facade, proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade, roof
shape, and the rhythm of spacing of properties on streets, including setback; and
The importance of historic, architectural or other features to the significance of the property.
§ 173-6. Certificate of appropriateness application procedure.
Prior to the commencement of any work requiring a certificate of appropriateness, the owner shall
file an application for such a certificate with the Historic Preservation Commission. The application
shall contain:
Name, address and telephone number of applicant;
Location and photographs of property;
Elevation drawings of proposed changes, if available;
Perspective drawings, including relationship to adjacent properties, if available;
Samples of color or materials to be used;
Where the proposal includes signs or lettering, a scale drawing showing the type of lettering
to be used, all dimensions and colors, a description of materials to be used, method of
illumination, and a plan showing the sign's location on the property; and
Any other information which the Commission may deem necessary in order to visualize the
proposed work.
No building permit shall be issued for such proposed work until a certificate of appropriateness
has first been issued by the Historic Preservation Commission. The certificate of appropriateness
required by this chapter shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building permit that may be
required by any other ordinance of the Village of Albion.
The Commission shall approve, deny or approve the permit with modifications within 62 days from
receipt of the completed application. The Commission may hold a public hearing on the
application at which an opportunity will be provided for proponents and opponents of the
application to present their views.
All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing. A copy shall be sent to the applicant by
registered mail and a copy filed with the Village Clerk's office for public inspection. The
Commission's decision shall state the reasons for denying or modifying any application.
Certificates of appropriateness shall be valid for 12 months, after which the owner must reapply if
he still wishes to undertake work on the property.
§ 173-7. Hardship criteria for demolition.
An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed demolition has been denied may
apply for relief on the ground of hardship. In order to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant
shall establish that:
The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that return
represents the most profitable return possible;

The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by a
purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return; and
Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed.
§ 173-8. Hardship criteria for alteration.
An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed alteration has been denied may apply
for relief on the ground of hardship. In order to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant shall
establish that the property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that
return represents the most profitable return possible.
§ 173-9. Hardship application procedure.
After receiving written notification from the Commission of the denial of a certificate of
appropriateness, an applicant may commence the hardship process with the Commission by
making a written request for relief to the Commission within 30 days. No building permit or
demolition permit shall be issued unless the Commission makes a finding that a hardship exists.
The Commission may hold a public hearing on the hardship application at which an opportunity
will be provided for proponents and opponents of the application to present their views.
The applicant shall consult in good faith with the Commissions, local preservation groups and
interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the
property.
All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing. A copy shall be sent to the applicant by
registered mail and a copy filed with the Village Clerk's Office for public inspection. The
Commission's decision shall state the reasons for granting of denying the hardship application. If
the application is granted, the Commission shall approve only such work as is necessary to
alleviate the hardship.
If the application is granted, the Village Board shall approve only such work as is necessary to
alleviate the hardship and effect substantial justice. If demolition is approved by the Village Board,
the Commission shall have the right to issue a delayed certificate of appropriateness. Such
certificate shall not permit demolition or razing for a period of up to 10 months from the date of the
Village Board's granting of hardship, during which time the Commission and the applicant shall
undertake serious and continuing discussion for the purpose of finding a method to save such
property. During such period, the Applicant and the Commission shall cooperate in attempting to
avoid demolition of the property. At the end of this ten-month period, if no mutually agreeable
method of saving the subject property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual success is
underway or if no formal application for funds from any governmental unit or nonprofit organization
to preserve the subject property is pending, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue the permit to
demolish the property.
§ 173-10. Enforcement.
All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness issued under this chapter shall conform
to any requirements included therein. It shall be the duty of the Building Code Enforcement Officer to
inspect periodically any such work to assure compliance. In the event work is found that is not being
performed in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness, or upon notification of such fact by the
Historic Preservation Commission, the Building Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a stop-work
order and all work shall immediately cease. No further work shall be undertaken on the project as long
as a stop-work order is in effect.

§ 173-11. Maintenance and repair required.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any
exterior architectural feature of a landmark or property within an historic district which does not
involve a change in design, material, color or outward appearance.
No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as landmark or included within an
historic district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the
deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of the Historic
Preservation Commission, produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the historic district
as a whole or the life and character of the property itself. Examples of such deterioration include:
Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical support.
Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members.
Deterioration of exterior chimneys.
Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar.
Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or foundations, including broken windows or
doors.
Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous condition which could lead to the
claim that demolition is necessary for the public safety.
§ 173-12. Penalties for offenses.
Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a violation and the
violator shall be liable to a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $100 for each day the violation
continues.
Any person who demolishes, alters, constructs, or permits a designated property to fall into a
serious state of disrepair in violation of this chapter shall be required to restore the property and its
site to its appearance prior to the violation. Any action to enforce this subsection shall be brought
by the Village Attorney. This civil remedy shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any criminal
prosecution and penalty.
§ 173-13. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Historic Preservation Commission relating to hardship or a
certificate or appropriateness may, within 15 days of the decision, file a written application with the
Village Board for review of the decision. Reviews shall be conducted based on the same record that
was before the Commission and using the same criteria.

approval of the Village Community Forest Advisory Board, and under the supervision of the
Superintendent of Public Works. In the performance of such work, consideration shall be given to
the following factors. These factors are determined to be of primary importance in maintaining the
Village forest.
Trees that must be removed shall be replaced by new planting, where feasible.
Wherever feasible, trees shall be planted near old and dying ones in anticipation of their
removal.
Unnatural regularity of spacing and arrangement shall be avoided.
Species selected may vary, depending on mitigating factors of the site as provided for in
§ 200-10.
Whenever any tree is planted or set out in conflict with the provisions of this section, it shall be
lawful for the Superintendent of Public works to remove or cause removal of the same. The cost of
removal of said tree shall constitute a lien and charge upon the real property of the owner
responsible for such planting until paid or otherwise satisfied or discharged and shall be collected
by the Village Treasurer in the manner provided by law for collection of taxes.
Notice of a determination to remove or cause removal of a tree planted or set out in violation of
this section shall be made by the Code Enforcement Officer to the responsible property owner by
mail to the last known address as shown on the Village tax rolls. Such notice shall be made 10
days prior to any removal.
Appeal of a decision to remove a tree planted or set out in violation of this section may be made
by a property owner to the Village of Albion Board of Trustees. Appeals shall be made in writing
and submitted to the Village Clerk prior to the scheduled removal date. The Village Board of
Trustees shall use the criteria and regulations contained in §§ 200-10 through 200-14 of this
chapter to reach a decision in any appeal. A decision of any appeal shall be made within 60 days
of receipt by the Village Clerk.
§ 200-10. Tree species to be planted and planting requirements.
Before planting, all street trees must be inspected and approved by the Superintendent of Public
Works, the Village Code Enforcement Officer, and/or their official designee.

So the Village Community Forest Advisory Board can determine the tree requirements for the
proposed site, any person wishing to plant a tree under the provisions of this chapter shall submit
to the Village a brief site plan of the proposed planting which shall:
Provide a photograph of the proposed site on which the planting will occur;
Show clearly all existing trees in that immediate vicinity, noting location, species, diameter
and condition;
Note whether existing trees will be retained, removed or relocated;
Show location of utilities, driveways, street tree locations, and the size and species of
proposed street trees (see tree specifications).
The applicant shall further refer to the site assessment criteria and include as much information
based on these criteria as is possible when making an application in order to expedite the site plan
review process.
The Village Community Forest Advisory Board develops and maintains a list of appropriate and
desirable trees for planting along streets in three size classes based on habitual growth and/or
mature height: small (under 30 feet), medium (30 to 45 feet) and large (over 45 feet). Efforts shall
be made to ensure a sufficient diversity of tree species. Lists of trees not suitable for planting will
also be created by the Village Community Forest Advisory Board. (See designated list
enumerating both appropriate and inappropriate trees, and Recommended Urban Trees: Site
Assessment and Tree Selection for Stress Tolerance, Urban Horticulture Institute Department of
Horticulture, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 2003.)
The selection of tree species shall be based on a site assessment. Overplanting of one tree
species can result in insect infestations and diseases, leading to the destruction of a large number
of trees in one area or even through the entire Village. The Village Community Forest Advisory
Board shall endeavor to limit any one species of tree to between 5% and 10% of a total number of
trees planted within the Village when reviewing a site plan. As a result, the Village's tree
population will be protected from widespread destruction due to insects and disease, ensuring a
long-lived and healthy urban forest.
A site assessment shall also consider tree requirements such as:
Hardiness zone.
Light conditions.
Heat.
Wind.
Soil pH.
Soil texture/type.
Soil compaction levels.
Soil drainage characteristics.
Salt levels from winter road spray.
Utility wires/poles.
Proximity to buildings, structures.

of this chapter, and no trees may be planted closer together than the following: small trees, 15 feet;
medium trees, 25 feet; and large trees, 35 feet; except in special plantings approved by the Community
Forest Advisory Board and/or designed or approved by a landscape architect or arborist.
§ 200-12. Distance from curb and sidewalk.
The distance trees may be planted from curbs or curblines and sidewalks will be in accordance with
the three species size classes listed in § 200-10 of this chapter, and no trees may be planted closer to
any curb or sidewalk than two feet for small trees, three feet for medium or large trees.
§ 200-13. Distance from street corners and fire hydrants.
No street tree shall be planted so as to obstruct the sight lines of vehicular traffic at any intersection or
corner. No street tree shall be planted within 10 feet of any fireplug.
§ 200-14. Utilities.
No street trees other than those species accepted as small trees by the Village Community Forest
Advisory Board may be planted under or within 10 feet of any overhead three-phase or single-phase
electric utility wire.
§ 200-15. Public tree care.
The Village shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and remove trees, plants and shrubs
within the lines of all streets, alleys, avenues, lanes, squares and public grounds as may be
necessary to insure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such
public grounds.
The Village Community Forest Advisory Board may remove or cause or order to be removed any
tree or part thereof which is in an unsafe condition, or which by reason of its nature is injurious to
sewers, electric power lines, gaslines, waterlines, or other public improvement, or is affected with
an injurious fungus, insect or other pest. This section does not prohibit the planting of street trees
by adjacent property owners, providing that the selection and location of said trees is in
accordance with §§ 200-9 through 200-14 of this chapter.
It shall be the duty and responsibility of all property owners to maintain the grounds of public
rights-of-way abutting the owner's property, regardless of whether such property is developed.
This maintenance shall include watering as needed and keeping such areas free from weeds or
any obstructions contrary to public safety.
Property owners are encouraged to water Village street trees, whether newly planted or mature,
whenever said trees are deprived of their normal source of moisture. Such watering should be
continued during dry weather until the street tree becomes acclimated to the new environment.

It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm or Village department to top any street
tree, park tree or other tree on public property. "Topping" is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs
to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove
the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Crown reduction by a qualified arborist may be substituted,
where appropriate. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility
wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempted from this
chapter at the determination of the Village Community Forest Advisory Board and/or Superintendent of
Public Works.
§ 200-18. Pruning and corner clearance.
Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the Village shall prune the
branches so that such branches shall not severely obstruct the light from any street lamp or
obstruct the view/sight lines of any street intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of
13 feet above the street surface or eight feet above the sidewalk surface. Such owners shall
remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a
menace to the safety of the public. The Village shall have the right to prune or remove any tree or
shrub on private property or when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street from
a streetlight or interferes with visibility of any traffic control device or sign or sight triangle at
intersections.
Tree limbs that grow near high voltage electrical conductors shall be maintained clear of such
conductors by the electric utility company in compliance with any applicable franchise agreements.
A utility tree-trimming policy shall be reviewed by the utility company and the Village Community
Forest Advisory Board prior to any trimming by the utility company, to ensure proper trimming and
pruning will be done without excessive and undue loss to the crown of the tree.
§ 200-19. Dead or diseased tree removal on private property.
The Superintendent of Public Works shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or
diseased trees on private property within the Village of Albion when such trees constitute a hazard
to life and property or harbor insects or disease which constitute a potential threat to other trees
within the Village. The Code Enforcement Officer will notify, in writing, the owners of such trees by
mail to the last known address as shown on the Village tax rolls. Removal shall be done by said
owners at their own expense within 60 days of such notice.
In the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the Village shall have the authority
to remove such trees. The Code Enforcement Officer will notify, in writing, the owner of such trees
by mail to the last known address as shown on the Village tax rolls. Such notification shall be
made 10 days prior to any removal. The cost of removing such trees shall constitute a lien and
charge upon the real property involved until paid or otherwise satisfied or discharged and shall be
collected by the Village Treasurer in the manner provided by law for the collection of taxes.
Appeals of an order or decision to remove a tree under the provisions of this section may be made
by a property owner to the Village of Albion Board of Trustees. Appeals shall be made in writing

All stumps of street and park trees shall be removed a minimum of four inches below the surface of the
ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the ground.
§ 200-21. Protection of trees.
In order to maintain the overall forest, reasonable efforts shall be made to replace trees that are
removed and to protect quality trees that are endangered. Trees removed by decision of the
Village Community Forest Advisory Board or by natural causes shall be replaced somewhere in
the forest on a one-for-one basis within one year, depending on the availability of sufficient funds.
The location and species of any replacement tree shall be determined by the Village Community
Forest Advisory Board.
Trees of desirable species and good health shall be protected from damage during construction,
sidewalk repair, utilities work above and below ground, and other similar activities. No person shall
without first obtaining a written permit from the Village Code Enforcement Officer:
Undertake any construction or development activity (including but not limited to the
excavation of any ditches, tunnels, or trenches, or the laying of pavement) within the dripline
or radius of 10 feet, whichever is greater, of any Village tree or shrub.
Move or park vehicles associated with any construction or development activity which may
damage or affect any tree or shrub on Village property.
The zone of protection shall include the ground beneath the canopy of the tree and shall be
enclosed with a substantial fence, frame, or box centered around the tree, not less than four feet
high. Unless the Superintendent of Public Works and the Village Community Forest Advisory
Board, for good cause, determine otherwise, all trees or shrubs on any public street or any other
Village-owned property directly impinging on any excavation or construction of any building,
structure or street work shall be guarded as follows:
For trees or shrubs with a crown spread of eight feet or less, a substantial fence, frame, or
box not less than four feet high and eight feet square shall surround the tree or shrub;
For trees or shrubs with a crown spread of over eight feet, a fence not less than four feet high
shall be placed at least at the tree or shrub's dripline or at a radius of a distance in feet from
the tree equal to the diameter of the trunk in inches DBH (diameter breast height: four feet),
whichever is greater. All building material, dirt, or other debris shall be kept outside this
barrier.
§ 200-22. Placing materials on public property.
No person shall deposit, place, store, or maintain upon any public place of the municipality any stone,
brick, sand, wood, steel, concrete, asphalt products or other materials which may impede the free
passage of water, air or fertilizer to the roots of any tree growing therein, except by written permit of the
Code Enforcement Officer.

Chapter 217. Curfew
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Albion 7-10-1996 as L.L. No. 4-1996.
Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 217-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Curfew Law of the Village of Albion."
§ 217-2. Policy; purpose and findings.
Policy. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Village of Albion to minimize nocturnal crime,
juvenile delinquency and vandalism and to prevent the damage and destruction of both public and
private property.
Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the village and to maintain rule and order by prescribing, in accordance with prevailing
community standards, regulations concerning the presence of minors on streets, roads, highways,
public parks or other public areas of the village at night to reduce juvenile crime and vandalism, to
protect the children and minors of the village and to further family responsibility.
Findings. The Board of Trustees of the village hereby finds that:
There has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain
parents and guidance for minors, resulting in minors being involved in a wide range of
unacceptable conduct, including vandalism; noisy, rowdy and disturbing behavior; breaking
and entering; public drinking; littering; and harassment of village residents.
Significant numbers of minors have been congregating in the village after dark, causing
disturbances to residents.
Offensive activities of minors are not easily controlled by existing laws.
The sense of the community is that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor
activities of minors.
There is a need for a curfew for minors to achieve, under local conditions, the policy and
purpose herein stated.
Curfew regulations will meet special needs, will enable the community to better control streets
and public places, will be a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and will

enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violations of laws by minors.
The curfew hours declared by this chapter take into consideration the danger hours for
nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with the potential risks incident to immaturity.
Curfew regulations in other communities have been a significant factor in reducing juvenile
delinquency.
Parental responsibility for the whereabouts and conduct of minors should be the norm; as
parental control increases, the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases.
§ 217-3. Definitions; word usage.
As used in this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the
meanings indicated:
KNOWINGLY
Includes knowledge of information which a parent should reasonably be expected to have
concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to include
and require neglectful or careless parents to maintain a reasonable community standard of
parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that a parent was
indifferent to the activities, conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
MINOR
Any person under the age of 18 years of age or, in equivalent phrasing sometimes employed
herein, any person 17 or less years of age.
PARENT

guardian, as a person who stands in loco parentis or as a person to whom legal custody has
been given by court order.

not limited to, public streets, roads, thoroughfares, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks,

transportation facilities, vehicles used for public transportation, parking lots or any other public
building, structure or area.
REMAIN OR LOITER
To stay behind, to tarry or to stay on or upon a public place.
TIME OF NIGHT
Based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern standard time or Eastern
daylight saving time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the village.
YEARS OF AGE
Continues from one birthday to, but not including, the day of the next so that 17 or less years
of age is equivalent to under 18 years of age.
The word "shall" is mandatory; the word "may" is permissive. When not inconsistent with the
context, words used in the present tense include the future; words in the plural number include the
singular; and words in the singular number include the plural.

Prior to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may
submit general site information, a location map and a sketch plan with a request for informal
consideration and advice. This step does not require formal application, fee or the filing of a plat. The
purpose of the preapplication procedure is to afford the subdivider an opportunity to consult early and
informally with the Planning Board before preparation of the preliminary plat in order to save time and
money and to make the most of opportunities for desirable development.
§ 278-6. Preliminary plat procedure.
The preliminary plat, topographic map, street profiles and formal subdivision plat and all procedure
relating thereto shall in all respects be in full compliance with the provision of §§ 7-728 and 7-730
of the Village Law and these regulations, except where variation therefrom may be specifically
authorized by the Board.
Seven copies each of the preliminary plat, as described in § 278-9, designated as such, at the
scale of not more than 100 feet to the inch, a topographic map at the same scale and proposed
street profiles at appropriate scales shall be filed with the Board. The Board shall then study the
preliminary plat and proposed street profiles in connection with the topography of the area, the
existing requirements of chapter 290, Zoning, if any, the Master Plan and the Village Map, if any,
and shall take into consideration the general requirements of the community and the best use of
the land to be subdivided. Particular attention shall be given to matters enumerated in §§ 7-728
and 7-730 of the Village Law as well as to specific requirements for parks, playgrounds, school
sites, boulevards and main thoroughfares, the adequacy of street connections and the suitability of
the land for development.
A public hearing must be held on the preliminary plat within 45 days of receipt of the plat by the
Clerk of the Board. Publication of a notice advertising the public hearing shall be made not later
than five days prior thereto in the official Village newspaper.
Not later than 45 days from the date of the hearing, the Board must either approve, with or without
modifications, or disapprove the preliminary plat. The grounds upon which the decision is made
shall be stated upon the records of the Board, and modifications, if any, shall be specifically sated
in the records.
The time in which the Board must take action on such plat may be extended by mutual consent of
the owner and the Board. Within five days of the approval of such preliminary plat, it shall be
certified by the Clerk of the Board as granted preliminary approval, a copy filed with the Village
and a certified copy mailed to the owner.
If the Board fails to take action on a preliminary plat within 45 days, plus any extensions, such plat
shall be deemed granted preliminary approval.
§ 278-7. Final plat procedure.
The subdivider, after official notification by the Board with respect to the preliminary plat and the
changes, if any, to be made thereto, shall, within six months thereafter, file with the Board original
drawings and seven copies of the final plat and street profiles
If such final plat is not so submitted, approval of the preliminary plat may be revoked by the Board.
Within 45 days of the submission of the final plat for approval by the Board, a public hearing shall
be held by the Board and shall be advertised at least once in the official newspaper at least five
days before such hearing.

If the Board deems the final plat to be in substantial agreement with a previously approved
preliminary plat and properly modified, if the preliminary plat was so approved, the Board may
waive the requirement for the second public hearing.
The Board shall, by resolution, conditionally approve with or without modifications, disapprove or
grant final approval and authorize signing of such final plat within 45 days of receipt if the hearing
is waived or within 45 days of the date of such hearing. The time in which the Board must take
action may be extended by mutual consent of the owner and the Board. If the Board fails to take
action on a final plat within the time prescribed therefor, the plat shall be deemed approved.
If the Board grants conditional approval of such final plat, the resolution shall empower a duly
authorized officer to sign the final plat subject to completion of requirements set forth in the
resolution. Within five days of such resolution, the final plat shall be certified by the Board as
conditionally approved and a copy filed with the Village and a certified copy mailed to the owner,
including a certified statement of such requirements which, when completed, will authorize the
signing of the conditionally approved final plat. Conditional approval shall expire 180 days after the
date of the resolution unless such requirements have been certified as completed. The Board may
extend such time, if warranted, not to exceed two additional periods of 90 days each.
The approved final plat must be filed in the Orleans County Clerk's office within 60 days from
approval. Approval shall constitute signing by the authorized Board officer or the date of a
certificate of failure to act under Subsection E.
Under no circumstances will construction or improvements be started before final approval of the
plat. The subdivider will be required to file with the Board a bond complying with §§ 7-728 and 7-
730 of the Village Law satisfactory to the Village Board as to form, sufficiency and surety for the
completion of such improvement. The Board will require from the Village Attorney or other
designated legal advisor a certificate as to the adequacy of any bond that may be proffered. The
subdivider will be required to tender offers of cession, in a form certified as satisfactory by the
Village Attorney, of all land, including streets, highways or parks, not specifically reserved for him
or her. Approval of the final plat by the Planning Board does not constitute an acceptance by the
Village of the dedication of any street, highway, park or other public open space.
Upon compliance with the foregoing and notation to that effect upon the final plat, it shall be
deemed to have final approval. The final plat shall then be referred to the Orleans County
Planning Council. Within 90 days after approval by the Village Planning Board, the developer must
file the final plat with the County Clerk or Registrar. Otherwise, such approval shall expire. It
should be noted that the developer must notify the Village prior to any construction or
improvements so that the Village may have an inspector available.
§ 278-8. General regulations.
The subdivider shall observe the following general requirements and principles of land subdivision:
In general, the proposed subdivision shall conform to the Village Map and to the Master Plan, if
such exist.
The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the continuation of the principal
streets in adjoining subdivisions and for their proper projection when adjoining property is not
subdivided and shall be of a width at least as great as that of such existing connection streets, but
in no event shall the width of said continuing streets be less than 60 feet. All streets shall be
constructed in accordance with specifications adopted by Albion Village Board, subject to approval
of the Village Superintendent of Highways.
Main highways and secondary highways shall not be less than the width shown on the Master
Plan, if such exists. Parkways and boulevards shall be such width as may be designated by the
Board. The width of minor streets shall not be less than 50 feet.

Dead-end streets, in general, shall have block lengths not exceeding 800 feet. At this point, if
practical, a sixty-foot right-of-way extending to the tract limits shall be set aside as a future cross
street. Temporary turnarounds at the end of dead-end streets must be constructed with the
approval of the Board.
Block lengths generally shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length.
Each block shall be planned to provide two rows of lots, but irregularly shaped blocks indented by
dead-end streets and containing interior parks will be acceptable when properly designed and
covered by agreements as to maintenance of interior parks.
Curb radii at intersections shall be not less than 20 feet, and property lines shall be adjusted
accordingly.
Side lines of lots, so far as practicable, shall be at right angles or radial to street lines. The size of
lots shall comply with Chapter 290, Zoning.
Care shall be exercised in the layout of lots at street intersections. Corner lots shall be increased
in size to provide that any structure to be placed thereon will conform to the building line of each
street.
Grades of all streets shall conform in general to the terrain and shall not in general be less than
0.5%, preferably no more than 5% and in no case more than 7%.
Land subject to flooding and land deemed by the Board to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential occupancy nor such other uses and may increase danger to health, life or property or
aggravate the flood hazard, but such land within the final plat shall be set aside for such uses as
shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory
living conditions.
In case a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be
arranged so as to allow the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision.
In general, no privately owned reserved strips controlling access to land dedicated or to be
dedicated to public use shall be permitted.
In general, street lines within a block deflecting from each other at any point more than 10° and
less than 45° shall be connected with a curve, the radius of which for the inner street line shall not
be less than 350 feet on main thoroughfares, 250 feet on secondary thoroughfares and 100 feet
on local streets. The outer street line in each case shall be parallel to such inner street line. If the
deflection is 46° or more, it shall be considered a street intersection and treated accordingly.
Variations of the general requirements above outlined may be permitted by the Board, on
application, when, in its judgment, special favors warrant such variation.
§ 278-9. Preliminary plat specifications.
Subdividers shall present to the Board a preliminary plat. Seven copies shall be filed at the scale of not
more than 100 feet to the inch, showing or accompanied by the following information. All of the
information set forth above is required by the Board for the purpose of complying with the Village Law
and for the information of the public at the public hearings. Due care in the preparation of this material

§ 280-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Swimming Pool Ordinance of the Village of Albion, New York."
§ 280-2. Purpose; intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by regulating
and restricting the location, use and operation of swimming pools and accessory structures, it being
recognized that there is a need to regulate such installation and maintenance of swimming pools in the
Village of Albion in that private swimming pools have become so common and numerous that they do
present a danger to the public health, safety and general welfare if unregulated and uncontrolled.
§ 280-3. Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
SWIMMING POOL
Any body of water or receptacle of water having a depth at any point greater than 24 inches, used
or intended to be used for swimming or bathing, and constructed, installed or maintained either
above, below or partly above and partly below ground level, except that a natural body of water
such as a lake, quarry or creek will not be considered a "swimming pool" for the purposes of this
chapter.
[Amended 8-14-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]; 7-11-2012 by L.L. No. 4-2012]
§ 280-4. Compliance required.
No swimming pool shall hereafter be erected, constructed or excavated except in compliance with the
following regulations and requirements, and all existing swimming pools shall, within 60 days after the
effective date of this chapter, comply with the following regulations and requirements.
§ 280-5. Permit required.

§ 280-6. Location.
All swimming pools shall be located to the rear of the front line of the main structure on the premises
and shall be at least four feet from the rear and side property lines of the premises. The Board of
Trustees of the Village of Albion may vary the requirements of this section after public hearing held
with at least five days' public notice published in the official newspaper of the village, where undue
hardship is imposed hereby; provided, however, that all existing swimming pools shall not be required
to comply with the terms of this section; however, all such existing swimming pools may not be
modified, enlarged or changed in any manner without complying with the provisions of this subsection.
§ 280-7. Drain requirements.
A swimming pool shall be provided with adequate drainage into the storm sewer system of the Village
of Albion. Where drainage into the storm sewer is impractical, the swimming pool may be drained onto
a lawn or other area, or to a dry well or wells, provided that the water does not overflow onto adjoining
property or otherwise provide damage to the adjoining properties or cause inconvenience to the
owners or occupants of such adjoining properties.
Editor's Note: See also Ch. 112, Sewers.
§ 280-8. Filling operation.
There shall be no permanent physical connection between a potable public or private water supply
system and a swimming pool; and when a temporary physical connection is installed, it shall be
operated so that no pool water can be discharged or siphoned into a potable supply system.
§ 280-9. Fence with gate required.
All swimming pools shall be completely surrounded by a fence or similar barrier at least four feet in
height. All gates and said fence shall be equipped with a locking device and all such gates shall be
locked when the swimming pool is not in use. The structure adjacent to the swimming pool may serve
as a portion of the fence requirement of this section. Walls or other structural components of the
swimming pool may also serve as a portion or as all of the fence requirements of this section, provided
that the walls or other structural components are at least four feet in height and that any entrance,
ladder or other means or structural component is equipped with a gate or similar barrier capable of
being locked, and which said gate or similar barrier shall be locked when the swimming pool is not in
use. Swimming pools which are completely enclosed shall be considered as complying with this
section, provided that all entrances to the pool from the exterior are capable of being locked.
§ 280-10. Penalties for offenses.
[Amended 8-14-1996 by L.L. No. 5-1996]
Any person who violates the provisions of this chapter or fails to comply with the requirements hereof
shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $250 or imprisoned for not more
than 15 days, or be subject to both such fine and imprisonment.

Mixed occupancies and uses not specified. In any case of mixed uses, the total requirements for
off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in this section, the requirements for offstreet
parking facilities shall be determined by the Planning Board during site plan review. Offstreet
parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities
for any other use, except as hereinafter specified for joint use.
Joint use. The off-street parking requirements of two or more uses, structures or parcels of land
may be satisfied by the same parking or loading space used jointly to the extent that it can be
shown by the owners or operators of the uses, structures or parcels that their operations and
parking needs do not overlap in point in time. If the uses, structures or parcels are under separate
ownership, the right to joint use of the parking space shall be evidenced by a deed, lease, contract
or other appropriate written document to establish the joint use. Said document shall bind the
owner, his heirs and assigns to maintain the required joint uses throughout the life of such uses
and shall be approved by the Village Attorney.
Use of public parking. Where public off-street parking facilities are available, other than off-street
parking provided for a public building, the Planning Board, during site plan review, may permit a
reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for uses located on any lot within 600
feet of such public parking facility.
Accessory uses.
No additional off-street parking shall be required for uses accessory to any institutional use
specified in the Parking Schedule included at the end of this chapter.
In the case of accessory retail sales, boat berths, restaurants or swimming pools, the parking
requirement for either the accessory use or the principal use, whichever requirement is less,
shall be reduced by 50%.
Required off-street parking space. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces for specific
uses as regulated in this chapter are contained in the Parking Schedule included at the end of
this chapter.
Editor's Note: The Parking Schedule is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 290-44. Loading regulations.
For every building, structure or part thereof having more than 5,000 square feet of gross building
area erected and occupied for business or industrial use, as well as for other uses requiring the
receipt and distribution of materials and merchandise by vehicles, there shall be space provided
and permanently maintained for loading and unloading berths on the same lot with such building.
Such berths shall be located to avoid undue interference with the public use of streets, alleys or
parking areas and provided in accord with the following standards:
Five thousand to 25,000 square feet: one space.
For each additional 25,000 square feet: one space.
The loading berth in each instance shall be not less than 12 feet in width, 35 feet in length and 14
feet in height.
Such space shall have convenient access to a public street, shall not be used for customer or
employee parking and shall not be considered as part of any required off-street parking area.

In order to encourage the sound development of street frontage, the following special regulations shall
apply to all nonresidential buildings and uses:
Each separate use, grouping of attached buildings or groupings of permitted uses shall not have
more than two points of access. Additional accessways may be approved by the Planning Board,
during site plan review, based on the need for such additional access which is supported by a
traffic analysis prepared and submitted by the applicant.
The use of common access points by two or more uses shall be encouraged by the Planning

Whenever natural features, such as trees, brooks, drainage channels and views, interfere with the
proposed use of property, the retention of the maximum amount of such features consistent with
the intended use of the property shall be encouraged.
§ 290-50. Nonconforming uses, structures and lots.
Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to permit nonconforming uses and structures to continue until
they are removed but not to encourage their survival.
Construction approval prior to adoption of this chapter. Nothing contained in this chapter shall
require any change in plans, construction or designated use of a building or site complying with
existing laws, a permit for which had been duly granted before the date of adoption of this chapter
or any applicable amendment thereto.
Continuance. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the lawful use of land or buildings
existing at the date of the adoption of this chapter may be continued although such use or building
does not conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the zone district in which such
land or building is located. The following provisions shall, however, apply to all nonconforming
uses, structures and lots:
A nonconforming lot shall not be further reduced in size.
A nonconforming building shall not be enlarged, extended or increased unless such
enlargement would tend to reduce the degree of nonconformance.
A nonconforming use shall not be expanded except as may be authorized by the Zoning
Board of Appeals through variance procedures.
A nonconforming use may be changed into a conforming use. When a nonconforming use is
changed to conform to the requirements of this chapter, the use of the building or tract of land
shall not be changed again except in accordance with these regulations.
Where such nonconforming use is upon the land itself and not enclosed within a structure or
where such use involves the removal of soil, minerals or the excavation of gravel or rock or
other material, such use may be continued upon the land being so used at the time of the
adoption hereof. Any such nonconforming use of the land may be extended or expanded to
include any part of the plot or parcel of land now being used or held in reserve for future use,
provided that such enlargement does not involve the use of any lot acquired or the excavation
rights of which were acquired by the excavation operator after the effective date of this
chapter. However, such extension or expansion of such nonconforming use shall comply with
the setback and fencing requirements of this chapter.
Abandonment. In any district, whenever a nonconforming use of land, premises, building or
structure or any part or portion thereof has been discontinued for a period of one year, such
nonconforming use shall not thereafter be reestablished and all future uses shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter. Such discontinuance of the active and continuous operation of
such nonconforming use or part of portion thereof for such period of one year is hereby construed
and considered to be an abandonment of such nonconforming use, regardless of any reservation
of an intent not to abandon the same or of an intent to resume active operations. If actual
abandonment in fact is evidenced by the removal of buildings, structures, machinery, equipment
and other evidences of such nonconforming use of the land and premises, the abandonment shall
be construed and considered to be completed, and all rights to reestablish or continue such
nonconforming use shall thereupon terminate.
Existing lots of record. A nonconforming lot of record existing at the effective date of this chapter
may be used for any purpose permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, irrespective of
its area or width, provided that the owner of such lot does not own any adjoining property which

would create a conforming lot if all or part of said property were combined with subject lot and
provided that all other provisions of this chapter are adhered to. No lot or lots in single ownership
shall hereafter be reduced in size so as to create one or more nonconforming lots.
Restoration.
Any building damaged by fire or other unintentional causes to the extent of more than 50% of
its true value shall not be repaired or rebuilt except in conformance with this chapter.
Provisions of Chapter 135, Buildings, Unsafe, of the Code of the Village of Albion shall apply
to the removal of debris and restoration of land. In the case of a permitted restoration of a
nonconforming use, such restoration shall not increase the degree of nonconformance.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any wall
or roof which has been declared unsafe by the Code Enforcement Official.
Normal maintenance repairs and incidental alteration of a building or other structure
containing a nonconforming use shall be permitted, provided that it does not extend the area
or volume of space occupied by the nonconforming use.
Any building which is nonconforming due to insufficient yard distances or lot area shall not be
considered a nonconforming use. Any alterations or structural changes may be accomplished
within the existing frame of said building, but any additions shall conform to the specific
setback and yard distance requirements of this chapter.
Moving. Should any structure be moved for any reason for any distance, it shall thereafter conform
to the requirements for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
Zoning district changes. Whenever the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one district to another of a different classification, the foregoing provisions
shall also apply to any nonconforming uses existing therein or created thereby.
Certification of nonconformance. After the effective date of this chapter, upon the written request
of the user of any structure or premises or at the instance of the Code Enforcement Official, an
examination by the Code Enforcement Official of any existing use shall be made. A report of the
findings made upon such examination shall thereafter be filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals,
together with a certificate of existing nonconforming use, which shall clearly describe the premises
and structure, if any, referred to and shall specify the nature and extent of such existing use. Such
certificate shall be prepared in triplicate; one copy of which shall be maintained by the Code
Enforcement Official, one copy of which shall be furnished to the Zoning Board of Appeals and
one copy to be furnished to the owner or user.
§ 290-51. Stormwater drainage.
All construction plans shall include consideration of stormwater drainage needs. Whenever possible,
site grading shall direct water away from buildings and structures to the natural drainageway.
§ 290-52. Sewage disposal.
Connection to the public sewer system shall be required for the use of any lot or building which
involves the disposal of sewage or wastewater. Such connections shall be approved by the Code
Enforcement Official and other local or state officials as may be required by state or local law or
regulations.

The use shall not generate traffic, parking, noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical
interference beyond that which normally occurs in the applicable zoning district.

access to neighboring properties.
§ 290-55. Habitation.
All residential habitation shall be in residential dwellings as defined in this chapter. No basement sited
independently of a structure shall be inhabited as a dwelling.
§ 290-56. Swimming pools.

standards:
Such pools shall be installed in the rear or side yard of the premises.

and Building Code.
This section does not apply to farm ponds or other natural or artificially made bodies of water.
§ 290-57. Satellite parabolic antennas

safety and aesthetic objectives of the Village.
Antennas smaller than 36 inches in diameter shall be permitted in any district without a permit.
All parabolic antennas larger than 36 inches in diameter shall require a zoning permit from the
Code Enforcement Official. Such antennas shall be located on in the rear yard only.
Antennas larger than 36 inches in diameter and located in a front or side yard or attached to a
building or tower shall require site plan review from the Village Planning Board. The Planning
Board may require the applicant to screen the dish in order to reduce potential nuisance or
disturbances to adjacent properties. Although locations in side and rear yards shall be
encouraged, a ground-mounted satellite TV dish antenna may be located in a front yard if the
applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that locating the dish in either
the side or rear yard would not provide adequate reception.
Antennas shall be set back from all other structures and all property lines a distance which is not
less than 1 1/2 times the distance between the highest part of such antenna or tower and the

approval of the Village Board. Duly approved individual sewage disposal systems shall be excepted
from this provision. Village Board approval shall be given only upon a finding that the proposed use
shall not have a detrimental effect upon surrounding properties and evidence of any required permits
necessary from the Department of Health and/or New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation. The Village Board may require the submission of any documents necessary to make the
foregoing finding.
Article VII. Special Permit Regulations
§ 290-59. General provisions.
The uses specified in this article are hereby declared to possess unique characteristics, requiring that
each proposal for any such use shall be considered by the Planning Board as an individual case. A
special use permit may be approved by the Planning Board and issued by the Code Enforcement
Official (CEO) only if the following standards are met:
The proposed special use is consistent with the general intent of the Village's Comprehensive
Plan and with the specific purposes set forth in this chapter.
The location, size and use of the structures involved, nature and intensity of the operations
involved and size and layout of the site in relation to the proposed special use are such that it shall
be compatible with the orderly development of the district.
The operation of the proposed special use is no more objectionable to the uses of nearby
properties, by reason of dust or smoke emission, noise, odors, fumes, pollution of air or water,
including subsurface waters, unsightliness or similar conditions, than would be the operation of
any permitted use.
The proposed special use satisfies each and all standards and conditions specified for such
special use by the relevant provisions of this article.
The Planning Board may impose additional conditions or restrictions as it may deem necessary
prior to approving any special use permit application in order to protect public health and safety,
the quality of the Village's neighborhoods and natural resources and the value of property. The
Code Enforcement Official shall make an on-site visit to each property authorized as a special use
not less than one time each year. The purpose of said site visit is to ensure that the use is being
operated in accord with the conditions specified by the Planning Board. If the Code Enforcement
Official determines that a violation of this Zoning Chapter or the conditions imposed by the
Planning Board exists, the certificate of occupancy and/or certificate of compliance shall be null
and void. A new special use permit application shall be required to be submitted and approved
prior to the reestablishment of said use.
Any structure proposed to be erected, reconstructed or structurally altered to accommodate a
specially permitted use shall comply with the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building
Construction Code and all other applicable laws, codes and regulations.

§ 290-70. Adult bookstores and adult entertainment
establishments.
Adult bookstores and adult entertainment establishments, as defined herein, may be approved in the
Light Industrial District (LI) by the Village Planning Board, following a public hearing and provided that
the standards and provisions specified below are maintained:
Purpose.
In the execution of this chapter, it is recognized that there are some uses which, due to their
very nature, have serious objectionable characteristics. The objectionable characteristics of
these uses are further heightened by their concentration in any one area, thereby having
deleterious effects on adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure
that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the
surrounding neighborhood or land uses.
It is further declared that the location of adult bookstores or adult entertainment
establishments in areas where youth may regularly assemble and the general atmosphere

In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into consideration the
benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such
determination, the Board shall also consider:
Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or
a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible
for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance;
Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or
environmental conditions in the neighborhood or zone district; and
Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration shall be relevant to
the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals but shall not necessarily preclude the
granting of the area variance.
The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall grant the minimum
variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and
protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.

and area variances, have the authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as
are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the property and/or the period of time
such variance shall be in effect. Such conditions shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of this
chapter and shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse impact that such variance
may have on the neighborhood or community.
§ 290-77. Procedures for variances and other appeals.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide requests for variances and appeals from and
review of any order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination made by an
administrative official charged with the enforcement of this chapter. Such appeal may be taken by
any person aggrieved or by an officer, department or board of the Village.
All applications for variances shall be in writing on forms established by the Zoning Board of
Appeals. Forms shall be available from the Code Enforcement Official.
Every application shall refer to the specific provision of the law involved and establish the details
of why the variance should be granted.
Upon receipt of the completed application the Zoning Board of Appeals shall:
Schedule a public hearing as provided in Subsection G of this section.
Arrange for publication of notice of the public hearing as described in Subsection G of this
section.

The Village Planning Board shall administer the review and granting of special permits.
§ 290-83. Procedure.
The Code Enforcement Official shall refer the completed special permit application to the Village
Planning Board within 10 days after receiving a completed application.
At its next regular or special meeting, the Village Planning Board shall designate a public hearing
date within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 45 days from the date the application was
received, or 60 days in cases when the application shall be referred to the County Planning Board
in accordance with General Municipal Law § 239-m.
The Village Planning Board shall send a notice of the public hearing to the applicant and publish a
notice of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village.

date of the public hearing and shall contain sufficient information so as to identify the property
involved and the nature of the proposed action.
The Village Planning Board shall make a factual record of all its proceedings involving the granting
of a special permit. The decision of the Planning Board shall contain the reasons for its decision.

information required for site plan approval as described in Article X of this chapter.
Each special permit application shall also receive site plan approval before the special permit may
be granted.
The Code Enforcement Official shall make an on-site visit to each property authorized as a special
use not less than one time each year. The purpose of said site visit is to ensure that the use is
being operated in accord with the conditions specified by the Planning Board. If the Code
Enforcement Official shall determine that a violation of this chapter or the conditions imposed by
the Planning Board exists, the certificate of occupancy and/or certificate of compliance shall be
null and void. A new special use permit application shall be required to be submitted and approved
prior to the reestablishment of said use.
No site preparation or construction shall commence nor shall existing structures be occupied for
any special permit use until final site development plan approval has been granted by the Planning
Board and permits have been issued by all governmental agencies involved.

other applicable laws, codes and regulations.
Integration of site plan approval procedure with other Planning Board approvals. Whenever the
particular circumstances of a proposed development require compliance with either the special
use permit procedures or other requirements of this chapter, the Planning Board shall attempt to
