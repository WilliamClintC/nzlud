ADOPTING ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE NUMBER 96-3
AN ORDINANCE APPROVING, ADOPTING AND ENACTING THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF YELLOW
SPRINGS, OHIO, 1996; REPEALING ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS IN CONFLICT
THEREWITH; PUBLISHING THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Yellow Springs, Ohio, has had the
matter of codification and general revision of the legislation of the Village
before it for some time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, The Council of the Village of Yellow Springs, Ohio, hereby
ordains that:
   Section 1.  The ordinances and resolutions of the Village of Yellow Springs,
Ohio, of a general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, arranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Yellow Springs,
Ohio, 1996.
         One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as
correct by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a
part hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of
Yellow Springs, Ohio.
   Section 2.  All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof which are in
conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the 1996 Codified Ordinances are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the 1996 Codified Ordinances shall not be construed
to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment
shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act
committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way;
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval;
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory;
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to February 4, 1996.
   Section 3.  Sections and subsections of the 1996 Codified Ordinances without
a legislative history or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof
are or contain new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
   Section 4.  Pursuant to Section 25 of the Village Charter and Ohio R.C.
731.23, the Clerk of Council shall cause to be published a summary of this
ordinance within one week after its passage, together with a summary of the new
matter contained in the Codified ordinances hereby approved, adopted and
enacted, which summary is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
   Section 5.  This ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure,
the emergency being the immediate necessity to provide for the public health,
peace and welfare by providing an up-to-date codification of the legislation of
the Village, consistent with State law, where and as required by Article XVIII,
Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, with which to administer the affairs of
the Village, enforce law and order and avoid practical and legal entanglements,
wherefore this ordinance and the Codified Ordinances hereby approved, adopted
and enacted shall be in full force and effect from and immediately after its
passage by an affirmative vote of not less than four members of Council.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self- identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

Secretary. This Commission submitted its draft September 18, 1950, and the
Charter was adopted by the electorate at the general election of November 7,

Village shall be vested in an elective Council, hereinafter referred to as "the
Council." A Village Manager as executive shall execute the laws and administer
the government of the Village. All powers of the Village shall be exercised in

manner be not prescribed, then in such manner as may be prescribed by
ordinance.
SECTION 3.  POWERS OF THE VILLAGE.
   The Village shall have all the powers, both expressed and implied, of local

   In each election to membership in the Council each elector may vote for as
many candidates as there are offices to be filled.
SECTION 11.  ELECTION.

membership on the Council shall be declared elected.
(11-3-15.)
SECTION 12.  VACANCIES.
   Vacancies on Council shall be filled by remaining members by an affirmative
vote of at least three Council Members. Any appointment made by Council must
expire at the next regular municipal election at which time the position must
be filled by election.
   Should there at any time be fewer than three members of Council elected

January following their election. They shall take the oath of office on or
before January first. The Mayor or Village Solicitor shall administer the oath
of office for the newly elected Council.
(11-6-90, 11-3-15.)
SECTION 15.  PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL.
   At its first meeting each newly elected Council shall elect one of its

who shall be an officer of the Village and who shall have the powers and
perform the duties provided in this Charter. No elected official of Yellow
Springs can be the Village Manager until two years after leaving office.  The

members.

SECTION 21.  ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   Council actions having the force of law may be by ordinance or resolution.
No ordinance or resolution shall contain more than one subject. Ordinances
shall prescribe permanent rules of conduct or government. Resolutions shall be
orders of the Council of a special or temporary nature. In addition to acts of
the Council required by statute or by this Charter to be by ordinance, every
act of the Council establishing a fine or other penalty or providing for the
appropriation of funds or for the contracting of indebtedness, shall be by
ordinance. The enacting clause of all ordinances shall be, "The Council of the
Village of Yellow Springs hereby ordains."
SECTION 22.  PROCEDURE FOR PASSAGE OF ORDINANCES; FIRST READING.
   Every ordinance shall be introduced in writing in the form substantially in
which it is to be finally passed. At its introduction, it shall be read by
title only unless Council by a majority vote requires reading in full. After
introduction, a summary of the ordinance shall be published one time within
twenty days in the local newspaper or in a newspaper with general circulation
within the Municipality or public media forum as allowed by Ohio law.  The
summary shall contain a statement that the complete text of the ordinance is
available for public inspection at the office of the Clerk of Council of the
Municipality, together with the date when it will be considered for final
passage by Council. The publication shall be at least one week prior to the
date of final passage.
(11-7-67, 11-6-07, 11-3-15.)
SECTION 23.  PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE PASSAGE OF ORDINANCE.
   The Council shall hold a public hearing and shall make available to the
public at the hearing copies of the proposed ordinance. All persons interested
shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Council by motion may waive the full
reading of the ordinance at the public hearing.
(11-6-07.)
SECTION 24.  FURTHER CONSIDERATION; INITIAL PASSAGE OF ORDINANCE.
   After the public hearing Council may pass such ordinance in substantially
the same form in which it was introduced. If, however, an amendment or
amendments amounting to a change of substance have been made, the ordinance
shall not be passed until the ordinance with the proposed amendment or
amendments has been published pursuant to Section
22 of the Charter and a public hearing has been conducted on the ordinance with
the proposed amendment or amendments in accordance with Section
23. Passage of an ordinance shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of
a quorum of Council. Thirty days after passage the ordinance shall take effect
and be in force.
(11-7-67.)
SECTION 25.  EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.
   The Council may, by an affirmative vote of not less than four members, pass
emergency ordinances to take effect at the time indicated therein, to preserve

the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
that next succeeding day which is not Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the
last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then
such act may be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a

(ORC 1.15)
202.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of the Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
   (b)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of the Codified
Ordinances does not, except as provided in division (c) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred with respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy with respect to any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
provision had not been repealed or amended.
   (c)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of a provision of the Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed
according to the provision as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
202.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (b)   References in the Codified Ordinances  to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,

   (c)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,

(ORC 1.55)
202.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. 
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
   (c)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails. 
   (d)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07  SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the
offender shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise
provided.
CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October.  Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard.  The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

206.01  PURCHASING.
   (a)   Procedures. The Village Manager shall act as Purchasing Agent for the
Village, making all purchases required by the Village and selling unused, worn-
out, surplus or obsolete equipment and materials.
   Whenever it is deemed necessary or desirable that supplies, materials or
equipment be purchased or secured, requisitions therefor shall be submitted to
the Purchasing Agent, specifying the nature of the purchase desired, the
quantity required and the performance requirements to be met. Upon receipt of
any such requisition, the Purchasing Agent shall inquire of potential suppliers
as to the cost of such purchase, in the form of informal offers to supply the
items required.
   If the probable cost thereof will be thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or
more, the  Purchasing Agent shall resort to formal bidding, as hereinafter
provided. If the probable cost will be less than thirty thousand dollars
($30,000), the Purchasing Agent may award the purchase to the supplier offering
the lowest and best bid among the informal bidders, provided that if the cost
will be thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or more, at least two informal bids,
or a statement as to why two bids are not available, shall be secured in
writing.
   (b)   Formal Bidding. Whenever formal bidding is necessary by reason of the
probable amount involved, the Purchasing Agent shall prepare or cause to be
prepared specifications for the article required and shall advertise the
requirements of the Village at least once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Village and inviting the tender of bids in writing for the furnishing of
such requirements, such bids to be publicly opened not less than thirty days
following the date of the first advertisement, at a time and place specified in
the published notice. The bids shall be opened and read publicly by the
Purchasing Agent. An investigation of the responsibility of the bidders shall
be made if the Village Manager deems it necessary.
   The Manager shall report to Council the bids and the results of any
investigation of the responsibility of the bidders and shall recommend to
Council the selection of the lowest and best bid, or, if he or she determines
that the interest of the Village would be better served, the rejection of all
bids.
   No contract for the purchase of articles at a cost of thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000) or more shall be made unless Council has, by ordinance or
resolution, authorized and directed the Village Manager to do so. Contracts for
the purchase of articles costing thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or more
shall be approved as to form by the Village Solicitor and certified as to the
availability of funds.
   (c)   Purchase Orders. Whenever informal bidding is followed pursuant to
this section, the Purchasing Agent shall prepare a purchase order addressed to
the successful bidder, directing him or her to supply the goods required in
accordance with the terms agreed upon.
   (d)   Inspection. The Purchasing Agent shall inspect or supervise the
inspection of all deliveries of supplies, materials or equipment to determine
their conformance with the specifications set forth or referred to in the order
or contract.
   (e)   Execution of Contracts. Unless otherwise specifically stated by a
resolution or ordinance of Council, all contracts made by and on behalf of the
Village shall be executed by the signature of the Village Manager.
   (f)   Exceptions. In the event of disaster or other emergency, if purchases
of supplies, materials or equipment must be made immediately without an
opportunity for following the procedures set forth herein or for Council
approval, the Village Manager is authorized to make necessary purchases in
excess of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) to protect the public health,
safety and welfare without complying with the procedures outlined in this
section. In the event of such emergency purchases, the Village Manager shall
report the details of the purchases to Council at the earliest possible regular
meeting. Competitive procedures under this chapter are not required in any part
of the following circumstances:
      (1)   The purchase consists of goods or services or any combination
thereof, and after reasonable inquiry, the Village Manager finds that only
source of supply is reasonably available;
      (2)   The expenditure is for the renewal or renegotiation of a lease or
license for telecommunications or electronic data processing equipment,
services or systems, or for the upgrade of such equipment, services or systems,
and for the maintenance therefor as supplied by the original source or its
successors or assigns; if such services were competitively bid in the last
three years;
      (3)   The purchase of goods or services is made from another political
subdivision, public agency, the State, or the Federal government, or as a third
party beneficiary under estate or Federal procurement contract;
      (4)   The purchase substantially involves services of a personal,
professional, highly technical or scientific nature, including, but not limited
to the services of an attorney, physician, appraiser, investigator, court
reporter, adjuster, consultant or licensed broker, or involves the special
skills or proprietary knowledge required for the servicing of specialized
equipment owned by the City;
      (5)   Services or supplies are available from a qualified nonprofit
agency pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4115.31 through 4115.35; and
      (6)   The purchase consists of goods or services of a public utility.
   In such instances the Village Manager shall determine appropriate
procurement processes to follow and shall advise Council of such purchases at
the earliest available time.
   (g)   Contracts for Services. If the probable cost of services to be
contracted for by the Village will be thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or
more, the Village Manager, as Purchasing Agent, shall institute formal bidding
procedures in the same manner as set forth above in division (b) of this
section. Competitive bidding shall not be required for contracts for services
of less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000).
   (h)   Contracts for Professional Design Firm Services. Contracts for
professional design firm services are governed by the provisions of division
(g) of this section. In addition, professional services of “professional design
firms” are governed by Ohio R.C. 153.65 through 153.71. Under the Ohio Revised
Code, the professional design services of architects, landscape architects,
professional engineers and surveyors must follow a designated qualification
selection process outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. The dollar level is set by
State law and will vary from time to time. The Village Manager shall utilize
this same basic mechanism for all professional design service contracts above
thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). The Village Council shall approve all such
contracts above thirty thousand dollars ($30,000).

206.02  SALE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY.
   Following a declaration by Council of personal property valued over one
thousand dollars ($1,000), or any real property as surplus, the sale of such
property shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
   (a)   All department heads shall submit to the Village Manager, or his or
her designee, from time to time, reports showing stocks of all supplies,
materials or equipment which are no longer in use, or which have been worn out
or obsolete.
   (b)   The Village Manager, or his or her designee, may order such items
transferred to another department, which can make use of them.
   (c)   The Village Manager, or his or her designee, may declare these items
valued at less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) on the Village's fixed asset
listing as surplus no longer needed for municipal purposes. The Village
Manager, or his or her designee, may then sell the same or trade them in on new
items. Council authorization declaring an item as surplus no longer needed for
municipal purposes is required in instances where an item has value as shown on
the Village's fixed asset listing of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
The Council ordinance or resolution shall specify the manner of disposing of
the item or it shall be disposed of as otherwise provided in this Section
206.02. Sale or trade-in shall be pursuant to procedures deemed appropriate by
the Village Manager, or his or her designee, and the money generated shall be
paid into the appropriate Village fund.
   (d)   Public notice of the sale, including the method of sale, shall be
given in newspapers of general circulation within and beyond the Village at
least once a week for three weeks and in other media as deemed appropriate.
   (e)   No offer to purchase said property shall be formally accepted until a

      Any such request shall be effective for one year from the date of filing
with the Clerk or until the Clerk receives written notice from such medium
canceling or modifying such request, whichever is earlier. Each requesting news
medium shall be informed of such period of effectiveness at the time it files
its request. Such requests may be modified or extended only by filing a
complete new request with the Clerk. A request shall not be deemed to be made
unless it is complete in all respects, and such request may be conclusively
relied on by the Village, the Municipal Body that is the subject of such
request, and the Clerk.
      Sec. 4.03   The Clerk shall give such oral notification or written
notification, or both, as the Clerk determines, to the news media that have
requested such advance notification in accordance with Sec. 4.02, of the time,
place and purposes of each special meeting, at least twenty-four hours prior to
the time of such special meeting.
      Sec. 4.04   In the event of an emergency requiring immediate official
action, a special meeting may be held without giving twenty-four hours advance
notification thereof to the requesting news media. The persons calling such
meeting, or any one or more of such persons or the Clerk on their behalf, shall
immediately give oral notification, email notification or written notification,
or all, as the person or persons giving such notification determine, of the
time, place and purposes of such special meeting to such news media that have
requested such advance notification in accordance with Sec. 4.02. The minutes
or the call, or both, of any such special meeting shall state the general
nature of the emergency requiring immediate official action.
   ARTICLE 5. NOTIFICATION OF DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF PUBLIC BUSINESS.
      Sec. 5.01   Any person, upon written request and as provided herein, may
obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings at which any specific
type of public business is scheduled to be discussed.
      Such person may file a written request with the Clerk specifying: the
person's name, and the address(es) email address if desired, and telephone
number(s) at or through which the person can be reached during and outside of
business hours; the specific type of public business the discussion of which
the person is requesting advance notification; the Municipal Body that is the
subject of such request; and the number of calendar months (not to exceed
twelve) which the request covers. Such request may be canceled by request from
such person to the Clerk.
      Each such written request must be accompanied by cash, or a check or
money order payable to the Village, in the amount of five dollars ($5.00) for
each twelve months or less covered by the request, which amount has been
determined by the Council to represent a reasonable fee to cover costs of
providing such advance notification. A separate fee is required for each
Municipal Body for which notification is requested.
      Such requests may be modified or extended only by filing a complete new
request with the Clerk. A request shall not be deemed to be made unless it is
complete in all respects, and such request may be conclusively relied on by the
Village, Municipal Body that is the subject of such request, and the Clerk.
      Sec. 5.02   The Clerk shall if possible give such advance notification
under this Article 5 by written and email notification. If such written or
email notification cannot be given or has not been given, the Clerk shall give
oral notification.
      The contents of written notification under this Sec. 5.02 may be a copy
of the agenda of the meeting. Written notification under this Sec. 5.02 may be
accomplished by giving advance written notification, by copies of the agendas,
of all meetings of the Municipal Body that is the subject of such request.
   ARTICLE 6. GENERAL.
      Sec. 6.01   Any person may visit or telephone the office of the Clerk
during that office's regular office hours to determine, based on information
available at that office: the time and place of regular meetings; the time,
place and purposes of any then known special meetings; and whether the
available agenda of any such future meeting states that any specific type of
public business, identified by such person, is to be discussed at such meeting.
      Sec. 6.02   Any notification provided herein to be given by the Clerk may
be given by any person acting in behalf of or under the authority of the Clerk.
      Sec. 6.03 A reasonable attempt at notification shall constitute
notification in compliance with these Rules.
      Sec. 6.04   To better insure compliance with these rules as to notice and
notification, it shall be the responsibility of the chairman or secretary of a
Municipal Body other than Council, or the person or persons calling the
meetings, to timely advise the Clerk of future meetings, and the subject
matters to be discussed thereat, of such municipal body.

   (a)   The following Administrative Guidelines for the Economic Development
Revolving Loan Fund are hereby adopted.
   (b)   The Village Manager is hereby directed to utilize these Guidelines in
administering the Economic Development Revolving Loan Program.
   VILLAGE OF YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO
   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND
   ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDELINES
   August, 2001
1.   Goals/Purpose
The Village has established the Economic Development Revolving Loan Fund
Program to support the creation of new, permanent jobs specifically targeting
the low and very low income population in an effort to contribute to the
overall health and stability of the local economy.
This Fund exists to derive economic development benefits by providing gap
financing to ventures that otherwise would not survive.  The Fund shall not be
used to compete with or replace the service of any local lending institution
but will attempt to provide the appropriate missing share that complements
participating commercial and personal financing of such ventures.  Only those
proposals which have utilized personal and commercial investment to their
respective limits and still indicate a lack of needed financing will be
considered for these funds.
Industrial and commercial projects located in the Yellow Springs School
District will be eligible for Fund assistance.  Preference will be given to
production entities (manufacturing or service industries) over commercial or
retailing activities.
2.   Standards for the Fund Portfolio
Only private, profit-making organizations are eligible for loan funds. 
Eligibility of a loan request will be determined based on the number and
permanence of jobs created and/or retained and the potential for new jobs.  As
a minimum standard, a project must create at least one permanent full-time
equivalent job for each twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in assistance. 
Of the new jobs created and/or those jobs retained, at least fifty-one percent
of them must be filled by persons from a low or very low income household, as
defined by the Federal HUD Program.
The Fund shall only be applied toward those requests that rely on other lending
sources for at least fifty percent of the total project cost.  To ensure that
the Fund is not being used as a substitute for private capital, the applicant
shall provide a “Sources and Uses” summary which outlines the financial
participation of the party (i.e. commercial lender, private investment and
Village loan) and where each financial source is being applied in the overall
project.  If deemed necessary, the Village may request information indicating
the denial of needed financial support from other sources prior to further
consideration of the loan request.
3.   Financing Policies
Due to the nature of the Fund, preference will be given to shorter term
projects which will allow relatively prompt reinvestment of the Fund's capital
base. As a general guideline, loans may be awarded for no less than five
thousand dollars ($5,000) and not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)
with a repayment term not to exceed five years.  Only direct loans will be made
from the Fund.  Fixed asset loans will be considered according to the useful
life of the assets collateralized.
Each loan agreement between the Village of Yellow Springs and any borrower will
require that the loan be called and the borrower be found in default if the
firm should move its operations from the Yellow Springs School District area
anytime during the duration of the loan.
The Borrower will formally commit to compliance with all applicable Federal
regulations.
4.   Pre-loan Application Assurance and Financial Disclosure
For existing businesses, three prior years of audited financial statements,
including balance sheets, profits and loss statements and operating statements,
shall be required.  Source and Use of Funds statements are also required.
For new business ventures, a complete business plan shall be submitted.  This
plan must include:  1) Equity Position, 2) Operations Sheet, 3) Proforma Cash
Flow, 4) Proforma Profit and Loss Statements, 5) Personnel Requirements and 6)
Projected Sales/Growth.
When the corporate net worth is insufficient to cover the liability of the
loan, a personal endorsement of the loan shall be required.
The applicant will give assurances of complying with all applicable Federal
regulations as they relate to the operations and employment.
The applicant may be required to provide the certificate or assignment of
insurance for fire and general liability, life insurance for the owner(s) and
business interruption insurance.
The applicant shall agree that all loan proceeds will be used for their agreed
upon purpose.  Loan funds shall not be co-mingled with any other purposes other
than those stated for the loan.
After a loan has been awarded, the recipient must provide operating statements
prepared by a third party, on a quarterly basis, which will be submitted to the
Administrator within twenty days of every quarter during the loan duration.
5.   Repayments of Funds
The Village has established an Economic Development Revolving Loan Fund to
disburse loan moneys awarded and receive loan repayment(s).  Loans will be
repaid on a monthly basis unless some other formal arrangement is approved by
Village Council.  The Village is responsible for holding these funds and to
administer, invest and account for all funds received.
6.   Establishment of Loan Review Committee and Loan Administrator
The Village Council will appoint a Loan Review Committee to review loan
applications and advise the Council on its decision to approve or disapprove a
loan.  The Committee shall consist of three members from the Yellow Springs
School District who have appropriate knowledge and ability to fulfill the
duties assigned.
Committee members will serve a three-year term without compensation and shall
be indemnified under the Village's insurance coverage.  The initial
appointments to this Committee shall be of three members having terms of one,
two and three years so that a single three-year term will expire each
succeeding year.
The Committee, by majority vote, may make recommendations to Village Council to
approve or disapprove loan requests and recommend an appropriate loan term and
specific interest rates for each loan.
A quorum of the Committee shall consist of a majority of appointed members at
meetings called on an “as-needed” basis.  The Committee shall receive a review
summary remark from the Program Administrator and the Village Treasurer
regarding specific loan requests.  The Committee will also report to the
Village Council on the status of the Fund on a quarterly basis.
The Village Manager or a designee shall be responsible for the ongoing
administration of the Loan Fund Program.  The following duties are the
responsibility of the Administrator:
   -Respond to requests for Loan Fund information and perform other associated
duties to help promote the use of the Fund;
   -Receive loan requests and assure the completeness of such requests to be
forwarded to the Review Committee (i.e. meet with the applicant and indicate
information gaps);
   -Execute loan closing procedures upon loan approval by Village Council;
   -Maintain individual loan folders for each loan awarded;
   -Maintain information regarding the Fund activity including out-of-pocket
expenditures, deposits, withdrawals, etc.;
   -Provide a management report semi-annually to the Village Council
summarizing loan activity and Fund status information; and
   -Provide staff support to the Loan Review Committee.
7.   Loan Selection and Approval Procedures
Loan requests received by the Loan Review Committee must be in writing and must
contain all pertinent information for Committee consideration.
All loans will be reviewed initially for eligibility.  Much of this can be
determined by the Administrator as part of the preparation work required for
Committee review.  Any loan being presented to the Review Committee must, at a
minimum, fulfill the following eligibility requirements:
      1.   The project being proposed must create or retain permanent jobs with
a majority of the job-holders coming from low or very low income households as
defined by the Federal HUD Program.
      2.   The request for funding does not exceed fifty percent of the total
project cost.
      3.   At least one permanent full-time equivalent job must be created for
each twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) requested.
      4.   The borrower must be a private, for-profit venture.
      5.   The project must be located in the Yellow Springs School District.
Other pertinent elements that will be considered by the Review Committee in
loan selection include:  1) proceeds used for fixed asset financing will hold
those assets as collateral; 2) proceeds used for operating costs must be
secured with personal or business liens; and 3) an indication that the
requested financing is not available through any other (personal or commercial)
lending sources.
The interest rate for any loan will be assigned at the current Treasury Bill
rate, as required by the Federal Government.  Any action to assign some other
rate must be clearly substantiated.
Special considerations for extremely unique circumstances may be considered in
the strict enforcement of the fifty percent gap-funding limit of the loan as it
reflects to the total project.
8.   Loan Servicing Procedures
After loan approval by the Village Council, the Administrator will prepare and
execute the closing documents and establish a loan service folder which will
contain:  1) all closing documents including the Village Resolution awarding
the loan; 2) a loan services checklist verifying that required application
information has been submitted and/or completed; 3) any correspondence relating
to the loan including the quarterly reports required from the recipient; and 4)
a completion summary indicating the final performance of the loan.
9.   Delinquent Loans
Delinquent loans are those that are ten days past due on monthly payment.  If
delinquency occurs, notification will be sent to the recipient regarding the
delinquency and also include a request that the recipient contact the
Administrator within five days.  Pending that response, the Administrator will
discuss remediating the delinquency.  If no action is implemented within thirty
days of the delinquency, the loan may be considered in default and called in
for full payment.
10.   Other Requirements
All loans awarded from the Loan Fund are made available on a non-discriminatory
basis without regard to race, sex, national origin, disability, religion, age,
sexual orientation or political affiliation.
Borrowers shall sign assurances that they will not discriminate in any manner
in their employment practices as they pertain to the use of the loan money.
Borrowers shall sign assurances they will comply with Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act, that they have appropriate Flood Hazard Insurance and that
an Environmental Review will be completed prior to any work being initiated on
the project.
Any funded project that re-locates outside of the Yellow Springs School
District at any time during the life of the loan will result in the loan being
recalled and immediately payable in full.
All covenants contained in the Loan Agreement between the Village of Yellow
Springs and the Borrower will be upheld by the Borrower and failure to do this
shall constitute a default under the Loan Agreement.
11.   Loans from Fund to the Village.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these guidelines or elsewhere in
these Codified Ordinances, the Village is hereby expressly authorized to make
loans and/or grants from the Fund to the Village of Yellow Springs and Miami
Township Community Improvement Corporation (“CIC”), also commonly known as
“Community Resources” for use by the CIC for the purpose of promoting and
managing economic development in the district identified in that certain
Community Economic Development Agreement among the Village and Miami Township,
Ohio.  All loans and/or grants of the Funds to the CIC shall be made pursuant
to such terms and conditions as may from time to time be approved by the
Village Council upon recommendation from the Village Manager and/or the Loan
Review Committee.

(Res. 99-2.  Passed 1-4-99.)
238.04  INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Introduction. The intent of the Investment Policy of the Village of
Yellow Springs is to define the parameters within which funds are to be
managed. In methods, procedures, and practices, the policy formalizes the
framework for the Village of Yellow Springs investment activities that must be
exercised to ensure effective and judicious fiscal and investment management of
the Village’s funds. The guidelines are intended to be broad enough to allow
the investment officer to function properly within the parameters of
responsibility and authority, yet specific enough to adequately safeguard the
investment assets.
   (b)   Governing Authority. The investment program shall be operated in
conformance with federal, state, and other legal requirements, including R.C. §
135.14.
   (c)   Scope.
      (1)   This policy applies to activities of the Village of Yellow Springs
with regard to investing the financial assets of all funds. In addition, funds
held by trustees or fiscal agents are excluded from these rules; however, all
funds are subject to regulations established by the State of Ohio. The covered
funds, and any new funds created by the Village of Yellow Springs, are defined
in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
      (2)   Except for funds in certain restricted and special funds, the
Village commingles its funds to maximize investment earnings and to increase
efficiencies with regard to investment pricing, safekeeping and administration.
Investment income will be allocated to the various funds based on their
respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
   (d)   General Objectives.  The primary objectives, in priority order, of
investment activities shall be:
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The goal will be
to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.
      (2)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently
liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the
objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and
economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints of safety
and liquidity needs.
   (e)   Standards of Care.
      (1)   Prudence.
         A.   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall
be the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of
managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with
written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence
shall be relieved of personal liability for an individual security’s credit
risk or market price changes, provided deviations from the expectations are
reported in a timely fashion and appropriated action is taken to control
adverse developments.
         B.   The “prudent person” standard states that:
            “Investments shall be made with judgement and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.”
      (2)   Ethics and Conflicts of Interest. Officers and employees involved
in the investment process shall refrain from personal activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
that could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.
Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interest in
financial institutions with which they conduct business. Disclosure shall be
made to the Village Manager. They shall further disclose any person financial/
investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment
portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking any personal
investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is
conducted on behalf of the Village.
      (3)   Delegation of Authority and Responsibilities.
         A.   Governing Body. The Village Council will retain ultimate
fiduciary responsibility for the portfolios. The Council will receive quarterly
investment reports, designate investment officers, and review the investment
policy making any changes necessary by adoption.
         B.   Investment Officers.
            1.   Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the
Treasurer as designated by Village Council. Whenever idle funds exist in the
treasury of the Village they may be invested in a manner agreed upon by the
Finance Director, the Village Manager, the Investment Committee and the Village
Treasurer, in accordance with R.C. §§ 731.56 to 731.59.
            2.   Responsibility for the operation of the investment program is
hereby delegated to the Treasurer who shall establish and maintain an inventory
of all obligations and securities acquired by the Village. The inventory shall
include the description of the security, type, cost, par value, maturity date,
settlement date, and coupon rate. The Treasurer shall produce a quarterly
portfolio report detailing the current inventory of all obligations and
securities, and all transactions during the quarter, income received and
investment expenses paid and other special reports as may be deemed necessary.
All participants in the investment process shall seek to act responsibly as
custodians of the public trust. No officer or designee may engage in an
investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and
supporting procedures.
         C.   Investment Committee. All investment decisions should be made
jointly with a Finance Director, the Village Manager, one-to-two Council
members and the Village Treasurer and should conform to all applicable laws and
regulations governing the investment of public moneys.
         D.   Investment Advisor. The Village may engage the services of one or
more external investment managers to assist in the management of the entity’s
investment portfolio in a manner consistent with the Village’s objectives. Such
external managers may be granted discretion to purchase and sell investment
securities in accordance with this Investment Policy. Such managers must be
registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.
   (f)   Safekeeping and Custody.
      (1)   Delivery vs. Payment. All trades of marketable securities will be
executed (cleared and settled) on a delivery vs. payment (DVP) basis to ensure
that securities are deposited in the Village’s safekeeping institution prior to
the release of funds.
      (2)   Third-party Safekeeping. Securities will be held by an independent
third-party safekeeping institution selected by the Village. All securities
will be evidenced by safekeeping receipts in the Village’s name. The
safekeeping institution shall provide a copy of its most recent report on
internal controls - Service Organization Control Reports (formerly 70 or SAS
70) prepared in accordance with the Statement on Standards for Attestation of
Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 (effective June 15, 2011.)
      (3)   Internal Controls. Management shall establish a system of internal
controls, which shall be documented in writing. The internal controls shall be
reviewed by the investment committee, where present, and with the independent
auditor. The controls shall be designed to prevent loss of public funds arising
from fraud, employee error, and misrepresentation by third parties,
unanticipated changes in financial markets or imprudent actions by employees
and officers of the Village.
   (g)   Permissible Investments. The Treasurer may invest in any instrument or
security authorized in R.C. § 135.14, as amended. Permissible investments
include:
      (1)   United States Treasury bills, notes, bonds, or any other obligation
or security issued by the United States Treasury or any other obligation
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States. Stripped
principal or interest obligations of such eligible obligations are strictly
prohibited.
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures, or any other obligations or securities
issued by any federal government agency or instrumentality, including but not
limited to the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Bank,
Federal Farm Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government
National Mortgage Association, and Student Loan Marketing Association. All
federal agency or instrumentality securities must be direct issuances of the
federal agency or instrumentality.
      (3)   STAR Ohio is eligible as long as the fund maintains the highest
letter rating provided by at least one nationally recognized standard rating
service as outlined in R.C. § 135.45.
      (4)   STAR Plus eligible and is a fully FDIC Insured Bank Deposit program

274.01  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.
   There is hereby established in and for the Village a Commission, which shall
be known as the Environmental Commission, for the purpose of conservation and
improvement of the environment.
(Ord. 2015-26.  Passed 11-16-15.)
274.02  MEMBERSHIP AND PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The Environmental Commission will consist of five to seven members who
are appointed by Council subsequent to submitting a letter of interest and
resume and being interviewed and recommended by two Council members.
   (b)   One member shall be a Council Liaison, appointed to serve at the
pleasure of Council, charged with coordinating Commission activities in line
with Village goals and objectives and ensuring communication between Council
and the Commission. The other members shall be appointed for three-year terms.
At the outset, some members shall be assigned two-year terms, and some members
shall be assigned three-year terms, after which all terms shall be three years
in duration. Members shall serve until their successor is appointed by Council
or they are no longer eligible to serve.
   (c)   Up to two members can be at-large members if there are no qualified
Village resident candidates or there are other compelling reasons in line with
the purpose of the Environmental Commission.  However, the Environmental
Commission will consist of a majority of Village residents, and non-resident
members should only be appointed in exceptional circumstances.
   (d)   Each member of the Environmental Commission shall demonstrate
experience, expertise and/or education that is relevant to the purpose, powers
and duties of the Commission. The members of the Environmental Commission shall
be as broadly representative of the residents of the Village as possible. The
Village Manager or Assistant Village Manager will serve as an ex officio
member.
   (e)   The Environmental Commission shall annually select a Chair, Vice-Chair
and Secretary.  Except in unusual circumstances, the Council Liaison will not
serve as an officer.  If the Environmental Commission is appropriated a budget,
it shall also elect a Treasurer.  The Chair creates the agenda and leads the
meeting.  The Vice-Chair fills in for the Chair in her or his absence and takes
on other responsibilities as appropriate.  The Secretary is responsible for
taking minutes and sending them to the Clerk of Council in a timely manner
after approval.
   (f)   Generally, a Commission member shall serve no more than two full
consecutive terms.  However, Council may determine in certain situations that
extending a Commission member's term is appropriate.  In the event of the death
or resignation of any member, a successor shall be appointed by Council to
serve for the unexpired period of the term for which such member has been
appointed.
   (g)   Council is authorized to appoint up to two alternate members to serve
on the Environmental Commission.  An alternate member shall be selected for a
term of two years and shall be a resident of the Village.  Alternate members
are encouraged to attend Environmental Commission meetings, whether or not they
are serving as a member of the Commission at that meeting.  However, there is
no requirement that an alternate member attend meetings at which she or he is
not asked to serve as an Environmental Commission member.  In any event, no
alternate member shall cast a vote on a matter that was heard, in part or in
full, at a prior meeting that the alternate member did not attend.  If an
alternate member is present as an Environmental Commission member and a vote is
to be taken on a matter for which the alternate member was not present during
part or all of the hearing on the matter, the alternate member shall not be
considered as part of the quorum for purposes of determining a majority of the
quorum of the Environmental Commission in deciding votes for and against
matters.  An alternate may apply to be a Commission member if a seat becomes
open in the manner outlined in subsection (a) hereof.
   (h)   A majority of current Environmental Commission members shall
constitute a quorum, and the concurring vote of a majority shall be necessary
to take any action authorized by the Code.
   (i)   The Environmental Commission will have available to it through the
Village Manager's office, without cost to its members, those things necessary
to carry out its charge, such as a meeting room, copying/printing and postage. 
Any other expenditure of funds must be approved by Council.
(Ord. 2015-26.  Passed 11-16-15.)
274.03  POWERS AND DUTIES.

list of agenda items to the Clerk of Council a week before a regular meeting,

289.01  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.
   There is hereby established in and for the Village a commission, which shall
be known as the Justice System Commission. This Commission will assist Village
Council and the Mayor in overseeing the Yellow Springs justice system and its
efforts to preserve the safety of all persons in the Village, to provide
respectful service in the interest of victims, to uphold civil liberties, to be
proactively anti-racist and to fight the criminalization of poverty and mental
illness. The Commission shall provide capacity regarding research on best
practices, data analysis regarding current and future practices and their
impacts, and other activities as directed by Village Council to support its
justice system goals.
(Ord. 2018-49.  Passed 12-3-18.)
289.02  MEMBERSHIP AND PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The Justice System Commission will consist of five to seven members
who are appointed by Council subsequent to submitting a letter of interest and
resume and being interviewed and recommended by two Council members.
   (b)   One member shall be a Council Liaison, appointed to serve at the
pleasure of Council, charged with coordinating Commission activities in line
with Village goals and objectives and ensuring communication between Council
and the Commission. The other members shall be appointed for three-year terms.
At the outset, some members shall be assigned two-year terms, and some members
shall be assigned three-year terms, after which all terms shall be three years
in duration. Members shall serve until their successor is appointed by Council
or they are no longer eligible to serve.
   (c)   Up to two members can be at-large members if there are no qualified
Village resident candidates or there are other compelling reasons in line with
the purpose of the Justice System Commission.  However, the Justice System
Commission will consist of a majority of Village residents, and non-resident
members should only be appointed in exceptional circumstances.
   (d)   Each member of the Justice System Commission shall demonstrate
experience, expertise and/or education that is relevant to the purpose, powers
and duties of the Commission. The members of the Justice System Commission
shall be as broadly representative of the residents of the Village as possible.
The Chief of Police or their appointee, a representative from the Mayor's
office, and a representative appointed by the Village Manager will serve as ex
officio members.
   (e)   The Justice System Commission shall annually select a Chair, Vice-
Chair and Secretary. Except in unusual circumstances, the Council Liaison will
not serve as an officer. The Chair with the Commission creates the agenda at
the end of each meeting. The Chair leads the meeting. The Vice-Chair fills in
for the Chair in their absence and takes on other responsibilities as
appropriate. The Secretary is responsible for taking minutes and sending them
to the Clerk of Council in a timely manner after approval.
   (f)   Generally, a Commission member shall serve no more than two full
consecutive terms. However, Council may determine in certain situations that
extending a Commission member's term is appropriate. In the event of the death
or resignation of any member, a successor shall be appointed by Council to
serve for the unexpired period of the term for which such member has been
appointed. 
   (g)   Council is authorized to appoint up to two alternate members to serve
on the Justice System Commission. An alternate member shall be selected for a
term of two years and shall be a resident of the Village. Alternate members are
encouraged to attend Justice System Commission meetings, whether or not they
are serving as a member of the Commission at that meeting. However, there is no
requirement that an alternate member attend meetings at which they are not
asked to serve as a Justice System Commission member. In any event, no
alternate member shall cast a vote on a matter that was heard, in part or in
full, at a prior meeting that the alternate member did not attend. If an
alternate member is present as a Justice System Commission member and a vote is
to be taken on a matter for which the alternate member was not present during
part or all of the hearing on the matter, the alternate member shall not be
considered as part of the quorum for purposes of determining a majority of the
quorum of the Justice System Commission in deciding votes for and against
matters. An alternate may apply to be a Commission member if a seat becomes
open in the manner outlined in division (a) of this section.
   (h)   A majority of current Justice System Commission members shall
constitute a quorum, and the concurring vote of a majority shall be necessary
to take any action authorized by the Code.
   (i)   The Justice System Commission will have available to it through the
Clerk of Council's office, without cost to its members, those things necessary
to carry out its charge, such as a meeting room, copying/printing and postage.
Any other expenditure of funds must be approved by Council.
(Ord. 2018-49.  Passed 12-3-18.)
289.03  POWERS AND DUTIES.

impounding of a vehicle under the following circumstances:
      (1)   When any vehicle is left unattended upon any street, bridge or
causeway and is so illegally parked so as to constitute a hazard or obstruction
to the normal movement of traffic, or so as to unreasonably interfere with
street cleaning or snow removal operations;
      (2)   When any motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, is left on private residential property, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.60, or on private agricultural property, for at least
four consecutive hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property, or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way
of any road or highway, for 48 consecutive hours or longer, without
notification to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving such vehicle in
such place, except that when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to
traffic, it may be ordered into storage immediately;
      (3)   When any vehicle has been stolen or operated without the consent of
the owner;
      (4)   When any vehicle displays illegal license plates or fails to
display the current lawfully required license plates;
      (5)   When any vehicle has been used in or connected with the commission
of a felony;
      (6)   When any vehicle has been damaged or wrecked so as to be inoperable
or violates equipment provisions of this Traffic Code whereby its continued
operation would constitute a condition hazardous to life, limb or property;

notify the registered vehicle owner of the fact of such removal and impounding,
reasons therefor and the place of storage. Any person desiring to redeem an

(R.C. § 4549.081(C))
414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least
thirty days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the Municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
   (e)   Every stop sign shall bear the word “stop” in letters not less than
six inches in height.  Every stop sign shall be located as near as practicable
to the property line of the street or highway at the entrance to which the stop
must be made, or at the nearest line of the crosswalk thereat, or, if none, at
the nearest line of the roadway.
   (f)   As provided in division (b) of this section, the following streets or

414.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04  SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official

distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken.  In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or (b)

metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination of them in the
defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily
substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of
the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of the alleged
violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division regarding the
admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time limit
specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during which a

chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw blood for the purpose of determining
the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance,
or combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director
of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.

section or for an equivalent offense, if there was at the time the bodily
substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the applicable
concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C., (a)(1)D.
and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may
be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or
innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a criminal
prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. The person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. The form to be read to the person to be
tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall state that the
person may have an independent test performed at the person's expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic

abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the blood, breath, or
urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety test to
the operator of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by
clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in
substantial compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible,
and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the
tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards
then in effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal

from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.

      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and any hospital,
first-aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant
to this section, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability based
upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a claim of
malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the person. The
immunity provided in this division is not available to a person who withdraws
blood if the person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition. “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section. Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Advice required. The arresting law enforcement officer shall give
advice in accordance with this division to any person under arrest for a
violation of division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
any other municipal O.V.I ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a
written form that contains the information described in division (g)(6) of this
section and shall read the advice to the person. The form shall contain a
statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest and read to the
person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall witness the
arresting officer's reading of the form, and the witnesses shall certify to
this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the chemical test or
tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer, within two hours of
the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does not submit to the
test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to submit
automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
      (6)   Certification of arrest. If a person is under arrest as described
in division (g)(5) of this section, before the person may be requested to
submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine,
the arresting officer shall read the following form to the person:
“You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State law
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested — operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken at
your own expense.”
      (7)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C.
4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-
stale driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person and
immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to appear
on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the person's
license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer shall order
the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs the
officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency
immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in which the
person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or permit, the
court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial appearance and any
action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (8)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, if the officer advises the
person in accordance with this section of the consequences of the person's
refusal or submission, and if either the person refuses to submit to the test
or tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of division (o) of this
section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
the person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a
prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   That the officer asked the person to take the designated
chemical test or tests, advised the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and
gave the person the form described in division (g)(6) of this section;
               d.   That either the person refused to submit to the chemical
test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the
chemical test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration
of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the
time of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(8)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (9)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
      (10)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (11)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and
sanctions provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i)to (v).

4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(5).
      (6)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under division (h)(1)C., D., or E. of this section is assigned or
transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any
other penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to Section

thousand dollars ($5,000) for any economic loss arising from an accident or
collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s operation
of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for which the
offender is sentenced under division (h) of this section.

      (3)   If the offender also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court

the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of

officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including

drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local
authorities, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the same at a speed
not exceeding the following:
      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected,
except that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-
way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section.  The end of every
school zone may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone.  Nothing in
this section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of
Traffic-Control Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be
indicated by signs equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other
special notice of the hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding

portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries.  The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of
the following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most
appropriate:

lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.
         G.   As used in this section, “special elementary school” means a
school that meets all of the following:

            5.   The principal or other person in charge of the special
elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent of the school
district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.

or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

Treasurer for deposit in the funds as set forth in Ohio R.C. 4513.263(E).
   (f)   Limitations on Evidence Used for Prosecution.
      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section
408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of Municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles. 
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a condition
of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

other legitimate business or act other than passage through the Municipality.

of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge five dollars
($5.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police
Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
the sum of ten dollars ($10.00).
      (4)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

and constructed that the trailer will follow substantially in the path of the
vehicle drawing it, without whipping or swerving from side to side.  Vehicles
used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials
between a local place of storage and supply and the farm, when drawn or towed
on a street or highway at a speed of 25 miles per hour or less, and vehicles
designed and used exclusively to transport a boat between a place of storage
and a marina, or in and around a marina, when drawn or towed on a street or
highway for a distance of no more than ten miles and at a speed of 25 miles per
hour or less, shall have a drawbar or other connection, including the hitch
mounted on the towing vehicle, which shall be of sufficient strength to pull
all the weight towed thereby.  Only one such vehicle used to transport
agricultural produce or agricultural production materials as provided in this
section may be towed or drawn at one time except as follows:
         A.   An agricultural tractor may tow or draw more than one such
vehicle;
         B.   A pickup truck or straight truck designed by the manufacturer to

452.05  WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a State highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
State highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,

However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may

         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue to such owner a salvage certificate of title, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, on private property for more than 72 hours

purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (g), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
   (h)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

      (3)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality and the
other jurisdiction or, while in this Municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense

boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (e)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in

would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (f)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this
section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an
element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined
to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in

   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015

16, 2015 if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section as
it existed on July 15, 2015.
(ORC 2901.13)
606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11  ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. 
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.  An attempt
to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense
under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
606.12  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.

available a surveillance use policy ("Surveillance Use Policy") concerning the
technology at issue.
      (1)   No use of surveillance technology by a Village entity pursuant to
division (a) of this section shall be permitted without the Village Council's
express approval of the related Surveillance Use Policy submitted by the
Village entity.
      (2)   Prior to approving or rejecting a Surveillance Use Policy, the
Village Council may request revisions be made by the submitting Village entity.
   (c)   A Surveillance Use Policy shall be a publicly-released written policy
governing the Village entity's use of the surveillance technology that, at a
minimum, includes and addresses the following:
      (1)   Purpose. Describes the surveillance technology, the fiscal impact
of the technology, and the specific purpose(s) the surveillance technology is
intended to advance.
      (2)   Authorized use. Details what specific capabilities and general uses
of the surveillance technology authorization is being sought.
      (3)   Adverse impact safeguards. Details any adverse impacts the use of
the surveillance technology may have on civil rights and liberties, and:
         A.   What safeguards to prevent such impacts that will be implemented;
and
         B.   What potential uses of the surveillance technology will be
expressly prohibited.
      (4)   Data collection and review.
         A.   What types of surveillance data will be collected, captured,
recorded, intercepted, or retained by the surveillance technology;
         B.   How and under what circumstances the data collected, captured,

severely compromised by the long-term storage of mass surveillance data, the
Surveillance Use Policy shall identify what rules shall govern the retention
and deletion of captured surveillance data.  Such rules may be adopted from an
existing section of the Village's Record Retention policy or may be proposed as
an amendment to the Record Retention policy.  Along with stating the governing
rules, the rationale for selecting the chosen rules, including why the chosen
rules are the most appropriate for the specifically implicated surveillance
data, shall be provided in the Surveillance Use Policy.
      (6)   Surveillance data sharing. If a Village entity is seeking
authorization to share access to surveillance technology or surveillance data
with any other governmental agencies, departments, bureaus, divisions, or
units, it shall detail:

amended with Council approval pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 2018-47.  Passed 11-19-18.)
607.04  STANDARD FOR APPROVAL.
   Before approving a request to fund, acquire, or use a surveillance
technology, Village Council shall determine that the benefits of the
surveillance technology outweigh its costs, that the proposal properly
safeguards civil liberties, privacy rights, and civil rights, and that the
proposed uses and deployments of the surveillance technology will not be based
upon discriminatory or viewpoint-based factors or have a disparate impact on
any community or group. To assist the public in participating in such an
analysis, all approved surveillance use policies shall be made available to the
public, at a designated page on the relevant Village entity's public website,
for as long as the related surveillance technology remains in use.  An approval
for the funding, acquisition and/or use of a surveillance technology by the
Village Council, where a risk of potential adverse impacts on civil rights or
civil liberties has been identified in the Surveillance Use Policy pursuant to
Section
607.03(C)(3), shall not be interpreted as an acquiescence to such impacts, but
rather as an acknowledgment that a risk of such impacts exists and must be
proactively avoided.
(Ord. 2018-47.  Passed 11-19-18.)
607.05  REVIEW OF PREEXISTING USES MANDATORY.
   (a)   No later than 120 days following the effective date of the passage of
the ordinance, any Village entity seeking to continue the use of any
surveillance technology that was in use prior to the effective date of this, or
the sharing of surveillance data therefrom, must commence a Village Council
approval process in accordance with this chapter unless the use is specifically
exempted in division (b) of this section.  If the Village Council has not
approved the continuing use of the surveillance technology, including the
Surveillance Use Policy, within 180 days of their submission to the Village
Council, the Village entity shall cease its use of the surveillance technology
and the sharing of surveillance data therefrom until such time as Village
Council approval is obtained in accordance with this Act.
   (b)   Exceptions.
      (1)   Police cruiser cameras, including audio obtained therefrom, shall
be deemed an approved surveillance technology requiring no additional approval
from Village Council; however, any changes to the existing policy shall be
presented to Village Council pursuant to this chapter;
      (2)   Emergency audio recording shall be deemed an approved surveillance
technology requiring no additional approval from Village Council;
      (3)   Utility meters insofar as they are used for billing purposes.

607.06  EMERGENCY USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY.
   Where a state of emergency has been declared by an authorized local or
county official, the Ohio Governor, or President of the United States, and such
an emergency presents an imminent risk to life or property or the Chief of
Police, Village Manager and the President of Council determines that the use of
unapproved surveillance technology is necessary because of the imminent risk to
life or property, the unapproved technology may be used without Council
approval for a period of not more than 96 hours following the declaration of
such an emergency, provided that doing so is consistent with all other
governing laws and regulations.  In such instance, a report will be provided to
full Council with ten days of the succession of the use.

designee shall post on its public web site all annual surveillance reports,
along with a summary which states, for the prior year, the number of requests
for approval submitted to Village Council under this chapter for funding,
acquisition, or use of technology, the number of times the Village Council
approved such requests, the number of times such requests were approved after
requested modifications, and the number of times such requests were rejected.
(Ord. 2018-47.  Passed 11-19-18.)
607.08  PROHIBITIONS.
   It shall be a violation of this chapter for the Village or any Village

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.

nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog

determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a

to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.

appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.16 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

the accused person, or the accused's attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

634.03.
(Ord. 2006-06.  Passed 3-20-06.)
634.03  SOUND MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under
investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at
other conditions, including but not limited to design, maximum and fluctuating
rates.
   (b)   All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following
procedures:
      (1)   The NCO shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources
contributing sound to the point of measurement.
      (2)   Measurements shall be taken at the property line as close as
practical to  the sound source to get a representative measurement of the
affected person.
      (3)   The measuring instrument must be calibrated using a calibrator
recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer before and after each
series of readings.
      (4)   The calibrator must be recalibrated at least once each year by the
manufacturer or by a person that has been approved by the manufacturer.
   A copy of written documentation of such recalibration shall be kept with the
equipment to which it refers.
   (c)   No outdoor measurements shall be taken:
      (1)   During periods when wind speeds, including gusts, exceed 15 mph;
      (2)   Without a windscreen, recommended by the measuring instrument
manufacturer, properly attached to the measuring instrument;
      (3)   Under any condition that allows the measuring instrument to become
wet (e.g., rain, snow or condensation); or
      (4)   When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance
of the measuring instrument.
   (d)   The NCO shall prepare a written report relating to each measurement
session, which report shall include:
      (1)   The date, day of the week, and times at which measurements are
taken;
      (2)   The times of calibration of the measuring instrument;
      (3)   The weather conditions; including wind speed and temperature;
      (4)   The identification of the measuring instrument by manufacturer,
model number and serial number;
      (5)   The normal operating cycle of the sound sources in question with a
description of the sources;
      (6)   The sound level, in dBA, with the sources in question operating;
      (7)   A sketch of the measurement site, including measurement locations
and relevant distances, containing sufficient information for another
investigator to repeat the measurements under similar conditions;
      (8)   If the measuring instrument position is other than that recommended
in division (f) below, a rationale and description of the more practical and
appropriate alternate position chosen.
   (e)   Prior to taking noise measurements the investigator shall explore the
vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that
could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character
of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to
measure the sound from the source in question.
   (f)   The measuring instrument shall be positioned three to five feet above
the ground and away from reflective surfaces, unless such levels are not
practical or unless the nature and location of the complaint and source of the
noise suggest a different measurement location is more practical or
appropriate, in which event the NCO shall take measurements at the preferable
location that will afford a reliable noise reading.
   (g)   If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft fly-overs or barking
dogs, that are unrelated to the measurements, increase the monitored sound
levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have
become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of
interest.
   (h)   The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to
ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question.
(Ord. 2006-06.  Passed 3-20-06.)

a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of

of this section.

672.03  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section.  While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

672.04  DEGREE OF OFFENSE WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY INVOLVED.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of
Section

involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its
face identifies the drawer or maker for whose use it is designed or identifies

drawer or maker or on which the amount is blank;
   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by Ohio
R.C. 4503.22, a temporary license placard or windshield sticker as prescribed
by Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable license plate, placard, or sticker as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;

(ORC 2913.71)
672.045  EVIDENCE OF THEFT OF RENTED PROPERTY.
   (a)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Renter.”  A person who owns rented property.
      (2)   “Rentee.”  A person who pays consideration to a renter for the use
of rented property.
   (b)   Each of the following shall be considered evidence of intent to commit
theft of rented property or rental services:
      (1)   At the time of entering into the rental contract, the rentee
presented the renter with identification that was materially false, fictitious,
or not current with respect to name, address, place of employment, or other
relevant information.
      (2)   After receiving a notice demanding the return of the rented
property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property.  The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee's agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite

698.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable.
      The offender shall pay all costs associated with a sanction imposed under
this division, including the cost of the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous

is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours. 
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06  MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.  (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating
and revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially equivalent
State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07  SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 5-5-08.)
840.02  VSP FEE, PERCENTAGE, AND AUDIT.
   (a)   Not sooner than 45 nor later than 60 days after the end of each
calendar quarter, a video service provider shall pay a VSP fee to the Village.
The fee shall be calculated quarterly by determining the provider's gross
revenue for the preceding calendar quarter as described in division (b) of this
section and multiplying the result by the percentage specified in division (c)
(1) or (2) of this section.
   (b)   Gross revenue shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
      (1)   Gross revenue shall consist of all of the following revenue for the
calendar quarter that is collected by the provider for video service from all
its subscribers having service addresses within the Village:
         A.   Recurring monthly charges for video service;
         B.   Event-based charges for video service, including, but not limited
to, pay-per-view and video-on-demand charges;
         C.   Charges for rental of set top boxes and other video service
equipment;
         D.   Service charges related to the provision of video service,
including, but not limited to, activation, installation, and repair;
         E.   Administrative charges related to the provision of video service,
including, but not limited to, service order and service termination charges.
         F.   Advertising revenue. For these purposes, "advertising revenue"
means the net revenue received by the video service provider for advertising on
its subscription-based video service within the Village. If such revenue is
derived under a regional or national compensation contract or arrangement
between the VSP and one or more advertisers or advertising representatives, the
amount of revenue derived for the Village shall be determined by multiplying
the total net revenue received by the video service provider under the contract
or arrangement by the percentage resulting from dividing the number of
subscribers in the Village by the total number of regional or national
subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under the contract or
arrangement.
      (2)   Gross revenue shall not include any of the following:
         A.   Any taxes, fees, or assessments that are collected by the video
service provider from video service subscribers for pass-through to any
Federal, State, or local government agency, including the video service
provider fee authorized under this section, the fee authorized under Ohio R.C.
1332.30(F), and the Federal Communications Commission user fee;
         B.   Uncollectible charges, except that uncollectible charges, all or
part of which are written off as bad debt but subsequently collected, less the
expenses of their collection shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         C.   Late payment charges;
         D.   Maintenance charges;
         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps in the
regular course of business or by other reasonable means, that are aggregated or
bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to, any revenue received by a VSP or its affiliates for
telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of directory
or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;
         F.   Reimbursement by programmers of marketing costs actually incurred
by the video service provider;
         G.   Any revenue not expressly enumerated in division (b)(1) of this
section.
   (c)   (1)   If in a calendar quarter a franchise fee is payable by a
provider under a franchise in effect in the Village, the percentage of gross
revenue payable in that calendar quarter by the video service provider to the
Village shall be the same percentage of gross revenue payable in that calendar
quarter pursuant to that franchise, not to exceed 5%.
      (2)   Otherwise, the percentage shall be 5% of a video service provider's
gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this chapter.
   (d)   A video service provider that pays a VSP fee pursuant to this section
may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a separate line item on the
regular bill of each of its video service subscribers that has a service
address within any portion of the Village.
   (e)   (1)   At its sole expense and not more often than once per calendar
year, the Village or its designee may conduct an audit for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of a video service provider's calculation of the video
service provider fees it paid to the Village in the audit period. For the
purpose of the audit, the video service provider shall make available for
inspection, at the location where such records are kept in the normal course of
business, those records pertaining to its gross revenue as defined in division
(b) of this section.
      (2)   A video service provider shall pay any amounts found to have been
underpaid in the audit within 30 days after notice and shall include interest
on the underpayments. However, payment need not be made in that 30-day period
if the VSP brings an action under division (e)(3) of this section.
      (3)   An action by the Village or by the VSP to dispute the amount of VSP
fee due based on the audit results may be brought in a court of competent
jurisdiction not later than two years following the end of the quarter to which
the disputed amount relates.
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 5-5-08.)
840.03  VSP FEE NOTICE PROVISION.
   Upon receipt of notice from a VSP that it will begin providing video service
in the Village pursuant to a State-issued video service authorization, the

850.13   SEVERABILITY.
   This chapter and each section and provision of this chapter, are hereby
declared to be independent sections and subsections and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent, the Village Council, by adoption of the
legislation containing this section, hereby states that it is the controlling
legislative intent that if any provisions of said chapter, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remaining
sections or provisions and the application of such sections and provisions to
any person or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall
not be affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that such sections and
provisions would have been passed independently if such section or provision
were so known to be invalid. The adoption of this chapter in a single
legislative act is merely for convenience. It is the intent that each and every
separate part hereof be severable so as to leave in effect as much of this
chapter as is not found invalid so as to provide as much benefit to its
citizens as possible while still protecting the rights guaranteed under the
U.S. and State Constitution. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to permit
the use of a computerized internet sweepstakes device or operation of
computerized internet sweepstakes terminal café if such use or operation is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal within the State
of Ohio.

   (b)   Location.
      (1)   In accordance with R.C. § 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation the municipality shall reserve the right to propose an alternate
location to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided
the alternate location is within 100 feet or a distance equal to the width of
the right-of-way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed,
whichever is greater.  The Village of Yellow Springs also finds that certain
locations and collocation configurations are preferred.  A preferred location
and collocation configuration shall be utilized whenever possible and should
only be surpassed if in the determination of the Village Manager or designee,
clear and convincing evidence supports such a decision.  Cost alone should not
be grounds for such a determination. The order of preference is as follows:
         A.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley.  If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         B.   Second small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement.  If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         C.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley.  If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         D.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement.  If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         E.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a wireless
support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located within the
municipality right-of-way.  If no such wireless support structure is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         F.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the municipality right-of-way.  If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         G.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the municipality right-of-way.
      (2)   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 1,230
feet from any existing small cell facility.
      (3)   Public utilities, cable operators, and operators shall comply with
the undergrounding requirements set forth in Section

height;
         B.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators;
         C.   As determined by the Village Manager or designee, wireless
support structures design shall be consistent with the design features of
nearby poles, including but not limited to consistent style, material, color,
and the design features of the existing or proposed streetscape, district, or
site and in furtherance of maintaining the historical context of a district or
specific site understanding that in some instances, there is a desire to
camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
      (2)   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
         A.   The municipality reserves the right to require the following:
            1.   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to the
extent deemed necessary by the Village Manager or designee in response to the
aesthetic context of the small cell facility.  Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
               a.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware.  The Village
Manager or designee may approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting
if, in the Village Manager or designee's discretion, the side-mounted antenna
would be a better match to the aesthetics and character of the immediate area
and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
               b.   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly above
the radome not to exceed six inches.
         B.   Each antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed six
cubic feet in volume.
         C.   All portions of a small cell facility other than an antenna and
as identified by the R.C. § 4939.01(P)2, shall not exceed twenty-eight cubic
feet in volume per facility.
         D.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small cell facilities.  Such common enclosures shall:
            1.   Not exceed twenty-one cubic feet in volume;
            2.   Not exceed ninety inches in height, twenty inches in width, or
twenty inches in depth;
            3.   Not extend more than twenty-four inches away from the pole on
which it is mounted;
            4.   Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which it
is mounted;
            5.   Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure; and
            6.   Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane's direction of travel.
         E.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design elements:
            1.   Material.  The enclosure material shall be metal, a composite,
or an equivalent material as determined by the Village Manager or designee.
            2.   Color.  The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            3.   Style.  The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            4.   Coordinated design elements.  Common enclosures shall match
the material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
               a.   Such enclosures are located within 5,000 feet of an
existing common enclosure; and
               b.   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support structures
of a similar or matching design.
            5.   Exception.  If the aesthetics and character of the immediate
area would be better matched by an enclosure of a different material, color,
style, or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure as
determined by the Village Manager or designee, then such design elements may be
substituted with an alternate design element.  Such determination shall be
based on the following factors:
               a.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               b.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               c.   The historical context of a district or specific site; and
               d.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from view.
         F.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault.  No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be satisfied as
determined by the Village Manager or designee:
            1.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence that
the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground vault,
or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element (i.e. - bus
stop shelter).  Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration.  If a
ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Village Manager or designee shall
reserve the right to require any of the following conditions:
               a.   Concealed enclosure.  All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Village Manager or designee.
               b.   Smallest size.  The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Village Manager or designee.
               c.   Camouflage.  Camouflaging elements may be required.  Such
elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on the
enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
            2.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be thirty
inches.
   876.05.3   Reservation of Right-of-way.  The municipality reserves the right
to reserve space for future public safety or transportation uses in the right-
of- way or on a wireless support structure or pole owned or operated by the
municipality in a documented and approved plan in place at the time an
application is filed.  A reservation of space shall not preclude placement of a
pole or collocation of a small cell facility.  If replacement of the
municipality's pole or wireless support structure is necessary to accommodate
the collocation of the small cell facility and the future use, the small cell
facility operator shall pay for the replacement of the pole or wireless support
structure, and the replaced pole or wireless support structure must accommodate
the future use.

878.01  PREAMBLE.
   (a)   Whereas: The drinking water supply for Yellow Springs comes from an
unconfined aquifer, characterized by layers of loose sediment, no surface
barrier, and is recharged (primarily) by rain that percolates down through the
ground and to a lesser degree by the Little Miami River; and
   (b)   Whereas: The Village of Yellow Springs drinking water supply is
identified as a sole source aquifer, and as such is protected by the Sole
Source Aquifer Protection Program authorized by (Section 1424e of) the Safe
Drinking Water Act of 1974; and
   (c)   Whereas: The Energy Policy Act 2005 allows the oil and gas industry
exemption from rules and regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act without
showing evidence this exemption from general law will not violate rights; and
   (d)   Whereas: the aquifer that feeds the Village of Yellow Springs is
considered to be at high risk for contamination according to a 2003 EPA
Susceptibility Report; and
   (e)   Whereas: many communities across the nation have already experienced
contamination of their streams, lakes, rivers and other sources of drinking
water as a result of fracking and placement of injection wells; and
   (f)   Whereas: oil and gas companies have identified Yellow Springs and
surrounding environs as 'geologically appropriate' for injection wells due to
the presence of Mt. Simon Sandstone; and
   (g)   Whereas: Ohio and other states have experienced earthquakes in
relation to the placement of injection wells; and
   (h)   Whereas: this chapter establishes a community bill of rights which
recognizes and secures the civil and political rights of Yellow Springs
residents, pursuant to Article I, Section 20 of the Ohio Constitution which
states: "This enumeration of rights shall not be construed to impair or deny
others retained by the people, and all powers, not herein delegated, remain
with the people;" and
   (i)   Whereas: the Ohio Revised Code, Title VII, Chapter 743, Section 25
titled "Jurisdiction of municipal corporations to prevent water pollution"
states that "No person shall pollute a running stream, the water of which is
used for domestic purposes by a municipal corporation, by putting therein a
putrid or offensive substance, injurious to health;" and
   (j)   Whereas: this chapter bans the extraction of gas and oil within the
Village or the placement of injection wells, along with associated activities,
because that extraction violates the civil rights of Yellow Springs residents,
and because it threatens the health, safety, and welfare of residents and
neighborhoods of Yellow Springs; and
   (k)   Whereas: this chapter removes legal powers and authority from gas and
oil extraction corporations within the Village, in recognition that those legal
powers are illegitimate and unjust, in that they place the rights of a
corporate minority over the rights and political authority of a majority of
Yellow Springs Village residents; and
   (l)   Whereas: this chapter shall be known and may be cited as "Yellow
Springs' Community Protection from Gas and Oil Extraction Ordinance;" and
   (m)   Whereas: this chapter is enacted pursuant to the inherent right of the
residents of Yellow Springs Village to govern their own community, including,
without limitation, the Declaration of Independence's declaration that
governments are instituted to secure the rights of people, and the Ohio
Constitution's recognition that "All political power is inherent in the
people."
   (n)   Now, therefore, be it hereby resolved by the Yellow Springs Village
Council, that there is hereby adopted the following ordinance, which
establishes a bill of rights for the residents and communities of the Village,
bans commercial extraction of gas and oil or the placement of injection wells
within Yellow Springs Village because those actions cannot be achieved without
violating the rights of residents and communities or endangering their health,
safety, and welfare; removes certain legal powers from gas and oil extraction
corporations operating within Yellow Springs Village; nullifies illegitimate
state laws, permits, and other authorizations which interfere with the rights
secured by this ordinance; and imposes liabilities and fines for violations
thereof.
(Ord. 2012-17.  Passed 10-1-12.)
878.02  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (a)   The Village Council of Yellow Springs finds that the commercial
extraction of gas and oil and the placement of injection wells in Yellow
Springs Village violates the rights of residents and neighborhoods, and poses a
significant threat to their health, safety, and welfare. Moreover, widespread
environmental and human health impacts have resulted from commercial gas and
oil extraction and injection wells in other areas. Regulating these activities
of commercial gas and oil extraction or injection well placement is not a
solution as it automatically means allowing commercial gas and oil extraction
to occur within the Village, thus violating the rights of residents and
neighborhoods and endangering their health, safety, and welfare by allowing the
deposit of toxins into the air, soil, water, environment, and the bodies of
residents within the Village.
   (b)   Meaningful regulatory limitations and prohibitions concerning gas and
oil extraction, along with zoning and land use provisions, are barred because
they conflict with certain legal powers claimed by resource extraction
corporations. The Village Council recognizes that environmental and economic
sustainability cannot be achieved if the rights of municipal majorities are
routinely overridden by corporate minorities claiming certain legal powers. The
Village Council also recognizes that sustainability cannot be achieved within a
system of preemption which enables those corporations to use state governments
to override local self-government, and which restricts municipalities to only
that lawmaking specifically authorized by state government.
   (c)   The Village Council believes that the protection of residents,
neighborhoods, and the natural environment constitutes the highest and best use
of the police powers that this municipality possesses. The Village Council also
believes that local legislation that embodies the interests of the community is
mandated by the doctrine of the consent of the governed, and the right to
local, community self-government. Thus, the Village Council hereby adopts this
chapter, which establishes a bill of rights for the residents and communities
of the Village, and which bans the extraction of gas and oil and any storage of
frack waste within Yellow Springs Village, along with associated activities,
because that extraction and those activities cannot be achieved without
violating the rights of residents and communities or endangering their health,
safety, and welfare, and which removes certain legal powers from gas and oil
extraction corporations operating within Yellow Springs Village, while
nullifying state laws, permits, and other authorizations which interfere with
the rights secured by this chapter.
(Ord. 2012-17.  Passed 10-1-12.)

one-half percent per year upon the following:
      (1)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned or received during the effective period of this chapter by residents of

         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits

earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of
all nonresident associations, unincorporated businesses, professions or other

association or other unincorporated business entity has an office or place of
business in the Village.
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of a
resident partner or owner of a nonresident association or other unincorporated

of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the Village

services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.

Village” means:

         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which are shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village, regardless of where
title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for Federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with the Village.  However, once the affiliated
group has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate return with the
Village, the affiliated group may not change their method of filing in any
subsequent tax year without written approval from the Superintendent.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion of its total business, the Superintendent may require
such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to ascertain
whether or not net profits are properly allocated to the Village. If the
Superintendent finds net profits are not properly allocated to the Village by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he or
she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair
and proper allocation of net profits to the Village.

any such are conducted by bona fide charitable, religious or educational
organizations and associations.

to perform all the sacraments of the religious body, including that of
marriage.
      (9)   Compensation paid to a precinct election official, to the extent
that such compensation does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually.
      (10)   Compensation for personal injuries or for damages to property by

(Initiative Ord. Passed 11-5-68; Ord. 2004-11.  Passed 4-5-04.)
880.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Filing Returns.  Each person who engages in business or other activity
or whose income, salary, qualifying wages, commission or other compensation is
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter shall, whether or not a tax is due
thereon, make and file a return on or before April 30 of each year for years
prior to taxable year 2004, and on or before April 15 for taxable years 2004
and later.  When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months from the
end of such fiscal year or period for years prior to taxable year 2004, and
within 105 days for taxable years 2004 and later.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 11-20-89.)
   (b)   Required Forms; Contents.  The return shall be filed with the
Superintendent on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from
the Superintendent or on other forms deemed acceptable by the Superintendent,
setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of income, qualifying wages, commissions and
other compensation received by the taxpayer and the gross income from a
business, profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the
acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and subject
to such tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Superintendent may require, including but not limited to
copies of all W-2 forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, and all applicable
federal schedules.
   (c)   Extensions.  The Superintendent may extend the time for filing of the
annual return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period not to exceed six
months, or for one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the
Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal income tax return for
taxable years prior to 2004.  For taxable year 2004 the extended due date shall
be the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.  For taxable years subsequent to
2004 the extended due date shall be the last day of the month to which the due
date of the federal income tax return has been extended.  The Superintendent
may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax
shown to be due thereon, by the date the return is normally due.  The extension
request may be made by filing a copy of the taxpayer's request for a federal
filing extension, or by filing a written request.  The Superintendent may deny
the extension if the taxpayer's income tax account with the Village is
delinquent in any way.  Interest but no penalty will be assessed when an
extension has been granted by the Superintendent and the final tax has been
paid within the period as extended.
   (d)   Payment; Credits; Refunds.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Superintendent the amount of taxes shown as due thereon,
provided, however, that credits shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which has been deducted at the
source pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.06;
         B.   Any portion of such tax which has been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
880.15 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
880.11, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or her election indicated
on the return, may have such overpayment or part thereof refunded.
   (e)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
880.11. Such amended returns shall be filed on a form obtainable upon request
from the Superintendent. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting
(i.e., cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for
filing the original return without the approval of the Superintendent.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the Village
tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and shall pay
any additional tax shown due thereon or make a claim for a refund of any
overpayment.
   (f)   Information Returns, Schedules and Statements.  Information returns,
schedules and statements required to support tax returns, which are incomplete
without such information, shall be filed within the time limits set forth for
the filing of the tax returns, and the failure to file such information
returns, schedules and statements shall be deemed to be a violation of this
chapter. However, the taxpayer shall have ten days after notification by the
Superintendent or his or her authorized representative to file the items
required by this division.
   (g)   The Village shall accept a generic form of its annual income tax
return if the generic form once completed and filed contains all of the
information required to be submitted with the Village's prescribed returns,
reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic
form otherwise complies with the rules or ordinances of the Village governing
the filing of returns, reports or documents.
   (h)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (i)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the Village,
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service, shall provide
the Village the names and addresses of the subcontractors.  The subcontractors
shall be responsible for all income tax withholding requirements under this
chapter.
(Initiative Ord. Passed 11-5-68; Ord. 2004-11.  Passed 4-5-04.)
880.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer shall, at the time of the payment of any income,
qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, deduct the tax at the
current effective rate stipulated by Section
880.03(a) from the income, qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation
due by such employer to his or her employees who are subject to the provisions
of this chapter. In making such deduction at the time of payment, the employer
shall compute the tax to the nearest full cent so that mills of five or more
shall be increased to the next full cent and mills less than five shall be
dropped. No person shall be entitled to a refund merely because such rounding
off of the tax results in an apparent overpayment based on his or her total
earnings. Each employer shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a
return and pay to the Superintendent the tax withheld during the preceding
month. However, the Superintendent shall have the authority to approve the
filing of returns and payment of the tax withheld on a quarterly basis if the
employee tax withheld by the employer for Yellow Springs, in the previous tax
year, averaged less than $300 per month. In such case the employer shall, on or
before the last day of each month following the calendar quarters ending March
31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, make a return and pay to the
Superintendent the tax withheld during the preceding calendar quarter. Such
approval for quarterly filings and payments may be withdrawn by the
Superintendent when it is in the best interest of the Village to do so. The
Superintendent shall provide, by regulation, the manner in which such approval
is to be granted or withdrawn.
(Ord. 84-1. Passed 1-16-84.)
   (b)   The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax has in fact been withheld.
   (c)   Such employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the Village, as a trustee for
the benefit of the Village, and any such tax collected by such employer from
his or her employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village, be deemed a
trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid to domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person's residence, even though such residence is in the Village,
but such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   On or before January 31 of each year beginning with the year 1970,
each employer shall file a withholding return on a form prescribed by and
obtainable upon request from the Superintendent, setting forth the names and
addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calendar year and the amount of tax withheld from such employees
and such other information as may be required by the rules and regulations
adopted by the Superintendent.
   (f)   Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or
charged with, the responsibility of collecting and withholding the tax and/or
filing the return and making payments for a corporation or association shall be
personally liable for failure to collect and withhold the tax, and/or file the
return or pay the taxes and penalties and interest due as required.  The
dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any employer does not discharge
the officers' or employees' liability for a prior failure of such business to
collect and withhold the tax and/or file a return or pay the taxes due.
(Initiative Ord. Passed 11-5-68; Ord. 2004-11.  Passed 4-5-04.)
880.07  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates the receipt of any taxable income which
is not subject to collection at the source as provided by Section
880.06, or income which is not taxed at a municipal tax rate equal to or
greater than the Village's, or who engages in any business, profession,
enterprise or activity subject to the tax imposed by Section
880.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such person's estimated taxable
income together with any estimated tax due thereon, if any.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 11-20-89.)
   (b)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 30 of each
year, and on or before April 15 for taxable years 2005 and later, during the
life of this chapter.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or
period, except the filing shall be within 105 days for taxable years 2005 and
later.
   (c)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable upon request from the Superintendent, or on other forms deemed
acceptable by the Superintendent. Credit shall be taken for the Village tax to
be withheld from any portion of such income to determine the estimated tax due.
In accordance with the provisions of Section
880.15, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality.
      (2)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may
be amended at any time.
      (3)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of the
following year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year, on or before the
date fixed by regulation of the Superintendent if it appears that the original
declaration made for such taxable year underestimated the taxpayer's income by
30% or more. At such time a payment which, together with prior payments, is
sufficient to pay the taxpayer's entire estimated liability shall be made.
   (d)   Upon the filing of the return required by Section
880.05, if it appears that the taxpayer did not pay 90% of his or her tax
liability as shown on such return, on or before January 31 or the date fixed by
regulations, whichever is applicable, the difference between 90% of such
taxpayer's tax liability and the amount of estimated tax actually paid on or
before January 31 or the date fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable,
shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Section
880.10, except that no penalties or interest shall be assessed for not filing a
declaration on any resident taxpayer who was not domiciled in the Village on
the first day of January in the year in which they became subject to estimated
payments, nor shall penalties or interest be assessed on estimated payments if
the taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to 100% of the previous year's tax
liability, provided that the previous year reflected a 12-month period.
   (e)   (1)   Effective January 1, 2003, such declaration of net estimated tax
to be paid the Village by taxpayers who are individuals shall be accompanied by
a payment of at least one-fourth of 90% of the estimated annual tax, less
credit, and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day
of the seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the beginning of the taxable
year.  However, in case an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the
remaining payment dates.
      (2)   Effective January 1, 2003, such declaration of estimated tax to be
paid to the village by corporations and associations shall be accompanied by a
payment of at least one-fourth of 90% of the estimated annual tax and at least
a similar amount shall be paid on or before June 15, September 15 and December
15.  In the case of a fiscal year taxpayer the second, third, and fourth
quarterly estimated payments shall be due on the fifteenth day of the sixth,
ninth, and twelfth months of the taxable year, respectively.  In case an
amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall
be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   The last quarterly payment of estimated tax need not be made if the
taxpayer files his or her final return and pays the balance of the tax due
thereon within 45 days following the end of his or her taxable year.
   (f)   The declaration and estimated payments shall be filed upon a form
furnished by or obtainable from the Superintendent, or on a generic form deemed
acceptable by the Superintendent.
(Initiative Ord. Passed 11-5-68; Ord. 2004-11.  Passed 4-5-04.)
880.08  DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TAXATION.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to receive the tax
imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers, to
keep an accurate record thereof and to report daily all moneys so received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to enforce payment of
all taxes owing the Village, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six
years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration
and/or make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and
amounts of payments thereof.
   (b)   The Superintendent is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
Council, by motion, to adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns.  Taxpayers are
hereby required to comply with said rules and regulations.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer or employer has failed to file a return
or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the
Superintendent may assess the amount of tax appearing to be due, together with
interest and penalties thereon, if any, in the following manner:
      (1)   General provisions.
         A.   If the Superintendent determines that any taxpayer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has a tax liability for which he or she has filed no
return or has filed an incorrect return and has failed to pay the full amount
of tax due, the Superintendent may issue a proposed assessment showing the
amount of tax due, together with any penalty and interest that may have accrued
thereon.
            1.   Such proposed assessment shall be served upon the taxpayer in
person or by mailing to his or her last known address. Proof of mailing
furnished by the U.S. Post Office shall be presumptive proof of receipt thereof
by the addressee.
            2.   A taxpayer may, within 15 days after the date the proposed
assessment was served or mailed, file a written protest with the
Superintendent. Within 15 days after receipt of the protest, the Superintendent
shall give the protestant an opportunity to be heard. The Superintendent may
extend the date of hearing for good cause shown. After the hearing the
Superintendent shall withdraw the assessment or adjust or reaffirm the
assessment, and it shall then become final. If no protest is filed as herein
provided, such proposed assessment shall become final 15 days after being
served.
         B.   After a proposed assessment becomes final, notice of such final
assessment shall be issued and shall be served in the same manner as a proposed
assessment.
            1.   A taxpayer shall have 30 days after the date the final
assessment was served or mailed within which to file written notice of appeal
with the Board of Tax Appeals. Such written notice of appeal shall be filed in
a sealed envelope plainly marked “Appeal to Board of Tax Appeals” and mailed or
delivered to the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall, within five days
after receipt thereof, deliver such appeal to the Chairperson of the Board of
Tax Appeals or, if the Chairperson is not available, to the Vice- Chairperson.
            2.   The Board of Tax Appeals shall then proceed in accordance with
the provisions of Section
880.13.
         C.   When any taxpayer, subject to the provision of this chapter, has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax due and has failed to pay such tax
to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent need not
issue an assessment but may proceed under the provisions of Sections
880.11 and
880.12.
      (2)   Provisions affecting employers.
         A.   If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to file a return for tax withheld and has
failed to pay to the Superintendent the full amount of such taxes, the
Superintendent shall issue a proposed assessment showing the amount of tax due,
together with any penalties and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the
provisions of divisions (c)(1)A. and (c)(1)B. of this section shall then apply.
         B.   If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to withhold tax, the Superintendent shall
issue a proposed assessment showing the tax due, together with any penalties
and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the provisions of divisions (c)
(1)A. and (c)(1)B. of this section shall then apply.
         C.   When an employer subject to the provisions of this chapter has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax withheld and has failed to pay such
tax to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent may
proceed under the provisions of Sections
880.11 and
880.12 and need not issue an assessment as provided in divisions  (c)(2)A. and
(c)(2)B of this section.
   (d)   Any taxpayer or employer who has not filed a notice of appeal to the
Board of Tax Appeals from a final assessment issued against the taxpayer or
employer shall pay the amount thereof within 30 days after service of such
final assessment.
   (e)   When an application for deferred payment of tax due is filed by a
taxpayer, the Superintendent may authorize partial payments of unpaid taxes
when, in his or her judgment, the taxpayer is unable, due to hardship
conditions, to pay the full amount of the tax when due and when, in his or her
judgment, such deferred payments are the best means of accomplishing the intent
of this chapter. However, the Superintendent shall not authorize an extension
of time for the payment of such taxes due for more than six months beyond the
date of the filing of the application.

INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Superintendent or any authorized employee is hereby authorized to
examine the books, papers, records and copies of Federal Income Tax Returns of
any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the
Superintendent believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter, for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was
made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such employer,
supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and
required to furnish within ten days following a written request by the
Superintendent, or his or her duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Superintendent is hereby authorized to order any person presumed
to have knowledge of the facts to appear before him or her and may examine such
person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been
returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income. For
this purpose he or she may compel the production of books, papers, records and
copies of Federal and State income tax returns and the attendance of all
persons before him or her, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he or she
believes such persons have knowledge of such income or information pertinent to
such inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and copies of Federal
Income Tax Returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by an employer
or person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax, or by any officer,
agent or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax,
or the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or
with an order or subpoena of the Superintendent authorized hereby, shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
880.99.
   (d)   Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, except for official purposes, or except when ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction. No person shall divulge such information.  See
Section

her tax liability for a period of six years from the date his or her return is
filed or the withholding taxes are paid.

880.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and all moneys withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this chapter, and remaining unpaid ten
days after they become due, shall bear interest at the rate of one-half of one
percent per month or fraction thereof.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in division (a) of this section,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld: one-half
of one percent per month or fraction thereof or 10%, whichever is greater;
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees: 3% per month or
fraction of a month or 10%, whichever is greater;
      (3)   If by the due date of the annual return the taxpayer has failed to
pay taxes, through tax withheld and/or estimated payments, equal to or greater
than the tax paid for the previous year, or to pay taxes equal to or greater
than 90% of the actual tax for the year: 10% of the difference between 90% of
the actual tax for the year and the amount paid through withholding and/or
estimated payments;
      (4)   Except in the case of fraud, the penalty shall not exceed 50% of
the unpaid tax.
   (c)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Superintendent when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Superintendent. Further, in the
absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit, provided that an
amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months
after final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Superintendent, the Board of Tax Appeals
may abate penalty or interest, or both, and on appeal from the refusal of the
Superintendent to so recommend, the Board of Tax Appeals may nevertheless abate
interest or penalty, or both.
   (e)   However, in no case shall penalty and interest charges be levied when
the total of such penalty and interest amounts to less than one dollar ($1.00).
   (f)   Any person required to withhold the tax, who knowingly fails to
withhold such tax or pay over such tax or knowingly attempts in any manner to
evade or defeat such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other
penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of
the tax evaded or not withheld or not paid over. No other penalty under this
section shall be applied to any offense to which this penalty is applied.
(Initiative Ord. Passed 11-5-68; Ord. 2004-11.  Passed 4-5-04.)
880.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. Except in the case of fraud, omission of 25% of income subject to
this tax or failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be
made after three years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever is
later. In the case of fraud, omission of 25% or more of income subject to this
tax, or failure to file a return, all additional assessments shall be made and
all prosecutions to recover Municipal income taxes and penalties and interest
thereon shall be brought within six years after the tax was due or the return
was filed, whichever is later. However, in those cases in which the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the
Federal statute of limitations, the period within which an additional
assessment may be made by the Superintendent shall be one year from the time of
the final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date when such payment was made or the
return was due or within three months after final determination of the Federal
tax liability, whichever is later.  However, the following shall apply
regarding refunds of tax withheld from non- qualified deferred compensation
plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from an NDCP.  The loss will be considered sustained only in
the taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money
and property pursuant to the NDCP.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution
of money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from an
NDCP, and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP
and upon which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the
amount representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed
and the income received from the NDCP.  If different tax rates applied to the
tax years in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates
will be used to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the non-qualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.  Income tax that
should have been deposited with the Village, but was deposited with another
municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the Village.  The Village will
allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed the Village that is in excess
of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate
of the other municipality is the same or higher than the Village's tax rate. 
If the Village's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of
the rates is also subject to collection by the Village.
   (d)   In the case of delinquencies, payments received shall first be applied
to delinquent penalties and interest, beginning with the oldest delinquency. 
Upon satisfaction of this debt payments  shall then be applied to delinquent
taxes, beginning with the oldest delinquency.
   (e)   Additional amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be
refunded or assessed unless such assessment results from income which the
taxpayer has failed to report.

         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact

         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method

881.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
881.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village. 
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the

section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

   Withholding Provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
881.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
881.03, of one and one-half percent.  An employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date
that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
               Payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made
to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's principal place of work with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with

applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

worksite in the Village at which the employer provides or provided services
that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last
more than twenty days in a calendar year. Services can reasonably be expected

more than twenty days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;

      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the twenty-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
881.02, the employer shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator

section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not

services within the Village, make any sales in the Village, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by the Village during the taxable year.  If the
affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the Village for the taxable
year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as
a taxpayer with the Village income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." 
The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.
of this section the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,

other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize

otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter.  The length of any extension granted under
division (p)(2)A. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the

taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated Municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated Municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated Municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year

Municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by a taxpayer under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   When an election is made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated Municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section

taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
881.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.05(r) through (y), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the Village;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
881.05(r) through (y) by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter.
   (b)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax

municipality.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless

in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.

beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
881.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section.  The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.

division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
Village under Section
881.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall

refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
881.21.

date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
881.18(a)(4).

withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
881.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer' s tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal
or State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village.  The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
881.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
881.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject
to the Village income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the Village income
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the
tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
881.12   LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. 
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
881.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
881.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
881.09, with interest on that amount as provided by of Section
881.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
881.13   AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
881.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056. 
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056. 
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the assessment's
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
            "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section.  A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
881.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
881.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter.  The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
881.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Village ordinance or State law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

accordance with division (a)(2) of this section.
      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,
and other document required to be filed with a the Tax Administrator or the
Village by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer
pursuant to applicable law, including at any time before January 1, 2016.

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

881.19   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of a query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and Federal and State income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         B.   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the Village's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         B.   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or other

Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by the
appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section

   Verification of Accuracy of Returns and Determination of Liability.
   (b)   (1)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   Identification Information.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's Social Security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
881.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
881.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under Section
881.19(c) within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
881.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
881.99 for a violation of Section
881.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Village at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Village Manager. This member
may be an employee of the Village, but may not be the Director of Finance or

administrative official.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may

sixty days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety days after
the Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its
final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within
fifteen days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Ohio R.C.

declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, or part hereof,
not been included therein.

CHAPTER.
   (a)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
881.27 to
881.42 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of the
municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in Section 881.28(c)
is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§

881.42, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter 5703.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the Village, on a form prescribed by the

taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the Village of its
termination of the election.
         b.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of any
taxable year.
         c.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer
is no longer subject to Sections
881.27 to
881.42, and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of
this chapter.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
881.27 to

      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01 and Section
881.02.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.28   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
881.27 to
881.42 is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context
in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax and in
R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the
laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall have control
over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined in R.C.
Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any
reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of
the United States related to Federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both
this section and Section
881.02, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in Sections
881.27 to
881.42.  As used in Sections
881.27 to
881.42 of this chapter only:
   (a)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
881.29, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   "Adjusted Federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of R.C. § 718.01 and Section
881.02, means a C corporation's Federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in Federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in Federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing Federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted Federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
881.33(e)(3)B.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
881.33(e)(3)B.
         If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in Section
881.02(c)(48)B., and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the
election described in Section
881.02(c)(24)E., the taxpayer shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income
under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed
payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for
the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the
Internal Revenue Code or United States Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or
accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of
the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
         Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of Federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
881.02, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745.  "Taxpayer" may include
receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required
to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
881.27 to
881.42 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for Federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
881.27 to
881.42 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for Federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for Federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
881.37.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.29   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under Section
881.27.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
881.04;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
881.37(a).
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
881.37(a).
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the Village  only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from a
stock of goods located within the Village.
         B.   The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
881.02(c)(12)L. and (c)(35)B. by the Village or substantially similar provision
of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall
add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that
was apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add
to its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village
under this section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)

   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Sections
881.27 to
881.42 is confidential, and no person shall disclose such information, except
for official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial order, or as
provided in R.C. § 4123.271 or 5703.21.  The Tax Commissioner may furnish the
Internal Revenue Service with copies of returns filed. This section does not
prohibit the publication of statistics in a form which does not disclose

   (b)   In May and November of each year, the Tax Commissioner shall provide
the Village Tax Administrator with the following information for every taxpayer
that filed tax returns with the Commissioner under Sections
881.27 to
881.42 and that had municipal taxable income apportionable to the Village under
this chapter for any prior year:
      (1)   The taxpayer's name, address, and Federal employer identification

      (2)   The taxpayer's apportionment ratio for, and amount of municipal
taxable income apportionable to, the Village pursuant to Section
881.29;

   (c)   Not later than thirty days after each distribution made to municipal
corporations under R.C. § 718.83, the Tax Commissioner shall provide to the
Village a report stating the name and Federal identification number of every
taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to the Village and
the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.
   (d)   The information described under divisions (b) and (c) of this section
shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the Village
Tax Administrator under R.C. § 718.83(D).
   (e)   (1)   The Village expects that the Tax Commissioner will, pursuant to
R.C. § 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it receives in the
performance of its administration of the municipal net profits tax for
taxpayers making the election provided in Section
881.27. The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and information, as
well as the information received pursuant to divisions (b) and (c) of this
section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the Tax
Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the Tax Administrator under this section, the Village reserves its right to
pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.31   FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section 881.35, shall be
submitted to the Tax Commissioner, on a form and in the manner prescribed by
the Commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)   If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one calendar
year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to compute
the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
881.28,
881.29, and, if applicable,
881.33 onto its annual return.
      (3)   The remittance shall be made payable to the Treasurer of State and
in the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no remittance is required.
   (b)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A.   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to include, with
each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund filed with the
Commissioner under Sections
881.27 to
881.42, copies of any relevant documents or other information.
         B.   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically through
the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the Tax Commissioner. The Department of
Taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (c)   (1)   A.   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a tax return with the Commissioner under this
section. The extended due date of the return shall be the fifteenth day of the
tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the Commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
881.01, the Commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (d)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (e)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.32   ELECTRONIC FILING.

either through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   A taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the Commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)   The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns and
make payments by electronic means;
      (2)   The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.33   CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under Federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
881.27, a valid election made by the taxpayer under Section
881.05(s) is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-
year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
881.27 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon
the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated Federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
881.28, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under Section
881.28(b) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.29, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.29, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated Federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
881.29, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
881.27 to
881.42 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
881.29 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
881.27 to
881.42 or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.34   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
881.27 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
881.27 to
881.42, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the
date an assessment is issued under Section
881.37, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.35   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this State for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of State.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the combined tax liability
for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of R.C. § 718.85.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
881.27 to
881.42 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income
tax return for that year.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.36   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
881.27 to
881.42 or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
881.27 to
881.42 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner, the Commissioner may
impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month or
fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the
due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
881.27 to
881.42 fails to do so, the Commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed the
following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, five percent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten percent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
881.27 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen percent of the
amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
881.27 to
881.42 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections
881.27 to
881.42, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
881.27 to
881.42, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section 881.38, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one
thousand dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the claim. Any penalty imposed
under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund
from the date of the refund, may be assessed under Section 881.37 without
regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by division (a) of
that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
881.27 to
881.42 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.37   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
881.27 to
881.42 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the Commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
881.38 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Sections
881.27 to
881.42, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in R.C. §
5703.37.  With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide instructions on how
to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this State, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or
until it is certified to the Attorney General for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the Attorney General for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section 881.38, with interest on that amount as
provided by that section.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.38   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
881.27 to
881.42, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by Section
881.37(a). The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the Director
of Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from the tax
refund fund created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than ten
dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)
881.39   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
881.27 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
881.27 to
881.42 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue
Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed
not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for Federal income tax purposes or after any Federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated Federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the
Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
881.37 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
881.38, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
Federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section
881.38. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.

881.40   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
881.27 to
881.42 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to
investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal and State

   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
881.27 to
881.42 shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the
taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Commissioner,
in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order
requires that they be kept longer. The Commissioner may require any person, by
notice served on that person, to keep such records as the Commissioner
determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the
extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
Federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 3-13-18.)

is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under R.C. § 718.15 or 718.151, or to modify
the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.

882.02  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village, for the use of the general fund of the Village, there is levied a
tax of three percent on all rents received by a lodging establishment for
lodging furnished to transient guests.
   (b)   The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the Village,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the
Village or by payment to the Village. The transient guest shall pay the tax to
the operator of the lodging establishment at the time the rent is paid. If the
rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid
with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due from each transient guest at
the time such guest ceases to occupy space in the lodging establishment. If,
for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the lodging
establishment, the Finance Director may require that such tax shall be paid
directly to the Finance Director.
(Ord. 2017-14.  Passed 9-5-17.)

than five nights per calendar year.

in the manner prescribed by the Finance Director.
(Ord. 2017-14.  Passed 9-5-17.)
882.04  PROHIBITION AGAINST FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX- EXEMPT STATUS.
   (a)   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as
required by this chapter or present to the operator false evidence indicating
that the lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 2017-14.  Passed 9-5-17.)
882.05  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   When possible, the tax to be collected shall be stated and charged

Registration Certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises. Said certificate shall among other things state the following:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the lodging establishment;
   (c)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (d)   “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Village
of Yellow Springs Lodging Excise Tax Ordinance by registering with the Zoning
Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Lodging
Excise Tax and remitting said tax to the Finance Director. This certificate
does not constitute a permit.”

   (b)   The Finance Director may authorize operators whose tax liability is
not such as to merit twice-yearly returns, as determined by the Finance
Director upon the basis of administrative costs of the Village, to make and
file returns at less frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in
writing, shall indicate the intervals at which returns are to be filed, and may
be revoked by the Finance Director upon thirty days written notice.
   (c)   All claims for exemptions from tax filed by transient guests with the
operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   (d)   All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated

order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State of Ohio, Greene County, or the Village of Yellow
Springs for official use only.
   (e)   If, for any reason, the lodging establishment shall cease doing
business in the Village, all returns and payments are due immediately upon
cessation of business.

held in trust for the account of the Village until payment thereof is made to
the Finance Director.

equal to ten percent of the total tax and penalty of the previous thirty-day
period shall be added for each successive thirty-day period the account remains
delinquent.
   (c)   Fraud. If the Finance Director determines that the non-payment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the

   (d)   Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator

exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (e)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section

DIRECTOR.

or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Finance Director shall
proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due.

he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax
imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused
to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and
penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the

addressed to the operator so assessed at their last known place of business.
   (c)   Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such

within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any,
determined by the Finance Director shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable.
   (d)   If such application is made, the Finance Director shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties.
At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest, and penalties should not be fixed.
   (e)   After such hearing, the Finance Director shall determine the proper
tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in

for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing to such operator at
their last known place of business. The findings of the Board of Tax Review
shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the
manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to
be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.

nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient guest to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Village by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section, but

Director, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator,
establishes to the satisfaction of the Finance Director that the transient
guest has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the
tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.

related facilities, shall be protected from harm or restored to standards
prescribed by the Village.
   (d)   Any work performed within a right-of-way shall be conducted in such a
manner as to minimize the danger or inconvenience to the public. Where use of
traffic control devices is indicated, such devices shall conform to the Manual

direct the work, or at any time revise the conditions of a permit when it
appears, in the judgment of the inspecting officer, that such is necessary to
preserve the public health, safety or welfare.
(Ord. 82-10. Passed 9-7-82.)
1020.03  REGULATED ACTIVITIES.

action is necessary.
   (c)   In cases where the problem condition is a consequence of the acts of
commission or omission of the present or past owner of the adjoining property,
the costs of correction may be billed to such owner and, if unpaid, may be
certified to the County Auditor for collection at the same time and in the same
manner as real property taxes are collected.

1021.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER. 
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide requirements for the use or
occupancy of any and all rights-of-way in the Municipality, and for the
issuance of permits to persons for such use or occupancy, and to set forth the
policies of the Municipality related thereto. 
   (b)   This chapter does not take the place of any franchise, license or
permit which may be additionally required by law. Each permittee shall obtain
any and all such additional franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the
operation and conduct of its business. 
   (c)   The Village Manager is hereby granted the authority and duty of
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   No person shall use, occupy, own or operate facilities in, under or
over any rights- of-way or any public property within the Municipality unless
such person first obtains a permit and conforms to the requirements set forth
therein and in this chapter. 
   (e)   Persons who have obtained approvals for use, occupancy and/or
ownership of facilities within a right-of-way, under the Village's Zoning Code,
shall not be required to obtain an additional permit under this chapter.
Documentation and notification procedures for right-of-way activity shall still
apply.
   (f)   The policy of the Municipality with regard to rights-of-way is hereby
declared to be:
      (1)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (2)   To promote the utilization of rights-of-way for the public health,
safety and welfare in the Municipality;
      (3)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
communication and other services to the Municipality's citizens and taxpayers
at reasonable rates;
      (4)   To promote cooperation between the Municipality and permittees in
the occupation of rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during right-of-way work, and uneconomic, unneeded and unsightly
duplication of facilities;
      (5)   To ensure adequate public compensation for private use of the
rights-of-way and the regulation thereof; 
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
rights-of-way and to establish the following priority of use of rights-of-way
when all requested usage of rights-of-way by permittees cannot be accommodated:
         A.   Use by the Municipality shall have first priority;
         B.   Use by another governmental entity, with the Municipality's
concurrence, or other uses required by law, shall have second priority;
         C.   Franchise permittees shall have third priority;
         D.   General permittees shall have fourth priority;
         E.   Special permittees shall have fifth priority; and
         F.   Residential permittees shall have sixth priority.
            However, the Village Manager may reasonably require right-of-way
permittees to cooperate to accommodate use by other permittees. Further, the
Village Manager may alter this priority when the Village Manager reasonably
determines a deviation herefrom to be in the public interest. 
      (7)   To protect the value of private property by setting minimum
aesthetic standards for uses in public property. 
   (g)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to apply to facilities
owned or operated by the Municipality or any of its operations. 
   (h)   Unless otherwise specifically stated in a permit or in a franchise,
all permits granted hereunder shall be non-exclusive.

(Ord. 97-01.  Passed 1-21-97.)
1021.04  PROCEDURE FOR PERMITS; TERMS. 
   (a)   Applicants for franchise permits shall be granted a franchise permit
hereunder, which shall be valid for as long as said franchise is valid and as
long as the applicable provisions of that franchise and of this chapter are
complied with, provided, however, that a franchise permit shall only entitle
the franchise permittee to utilize the rights-of-way, in accordance with this
chapter, for purposes directly related to the provision of the specific
services for which the permittee has a specific franchise. Any other right-of-
way use by such permittee shall require a separate permit of another available
type, as outlined in Section
1021.03, which shall be granted upon application and compliance with the terms
and standards required. 
   (b)   Applicants for general permits, or renewals thereof, shall file an
application therefor, in such form as the regulations require, along with an
application fee as also set forth in the regulations (which may contain
disparate fees for initial permits and renewal permits). The Village Manager
shall determine if the application is in order and, if so, make a
recommendation to Council as to whether or not, in accordance with the criteria
set forth in Section 1201.05, the applicant should be granted a permit
hereunder. Council shall then consider such recommendation and make a final
determination as to whether or not such permit should be granted and, if so,
upon what terms and conditions. The term of such permit shall be for five
years. Any person proposing to operate an open video system (OVS) shall be
required to obtain a general permit.
   (c)   Applicants for special permits, or renewals thereof, shall file an
application therefor, in such form as the regulations require, along with an
application fee as also set forth in the regulations (which may require
disparate fees for initial permits and, renewal permits). The Village Manager
shall determine if the application is in order. If so, and if the Village
Manager also finds, in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section
1021.05, that the application should be granted, the Village Manager shall
conditionally grant or renew such a permit. Such conditional special permit
shall become final unless modified or rejected by Council within thirty days of
issuance by the Village Manager. The term of such permits shall be two years
unless the applicant requests a lesser term. 
   (d)   Applicants for residential permits shall file an application therefor,
in such form as the regulations require, along with an application fee as set
forth in the regulations. The Village Manager or the Village Manager's
designate shall determine if the application is in order and, if so, shall
grant the application as long as the Village Manager also finds, in accordance
with the criteria set forth in Section
1021.05, that the application should be granted. Residential permits shall be
valid until canceled by the Village Manager upon sixty days written notice to
the permittee, provided, however, that upon a finding by the Village Manager
that an emergency exists, the Village Manager may cancel any such permit upon
such lesser notice as is necessary under the circumstances. Said notice shall
be deemed to be sufficient if it is reasonably mailed to or left at the
residence benefiting from the residential permit. 
   (e)   Any applicant may appeal the failure of the Village Manager to grant a
permit or to recommend it to be granted upon terms and conditions acceptable to
the applicant. In order to perfect such an appeal, the applicant shall file,
within ten days of the Village Manager's determination or recommendation, or
within ninety days of the filing of the application if the Village Manager has
taken no action, an appeal to Council. Council shall then review the matter and

remedy the stated violation, then, after granting the permittee an opportunity
to be heard in person or in writing, the Council may revoke the permit.

specifically permitted by the Municipality to continue the same, and upon the
removal thereof, restore, repair or reconstruct the area where such removal has

requirement. In the event of failure, neglect or refusal of the permittee,
after thirty days written notice by the Municipality, to remove the facilities
or to repair, restore, reconstruct, improve or maintain such vacated area, the
Municipality may do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost thereof as

all consumers within the Village's service area for all users who:
         A.   Are currently taking service from the Village and are not located
in a residential district;
         B.   Have the ability to generate power through the use of their
generation equipment; or
         C.   Are not delinquent in payment on their Village utility account.
      (2)   Type of service.  Single-phase or three-phase, sixty hertz, at
seller's standard secondary voltages.
      (3)   Monthly credit.  Consumers who contract with the Village for the
backup power generation credit shall receive a monthly credit based upon the
following two components:
         A.   Available KW capacity of customer's generator credited at $2.00/
KW/month; and
         B.   Any KWH generated through the operation of the generator, only
when requested by the Village, credited pursuant to the following formula:
            ($0.15/KWH) x (the KW output of the generator) x (the number of
hours of operation per month).
      (4)   Consumers who opt for this credit must provide all fuel costs and
maintenance costs for the generator.  Consumers are not allowed to sell the
power generated by such generator to anyone else.
      (5)   The Village will not be required to pay for power generation in any
hour that it has not requested a customer to generate such power.  Only those
customers who contract for the KW credit are obligated to run such power
generation any time, upon request of the Village.
(Ord. 98-6.  Passed 9-8-98.)
   (g)   Power Supply Cost and Excise (Kilowatt-hour) Tax Adjustment.
      (1)   Power supply cost adjustment.  The Village's electric rates and
charges are based upon the Village's average cost of power supply as furnished
by American Municipal Power - Ohio (AMP-Ohio).  In the event that said average
power supply costs per kWh is increased or decreased, the electric rates,
excluding the private outdoor lighting rate, will be adjusted as specified
below.
      (2)   Base power supply cost.  The overall base power supply cost to be
used to determine that adjustment applicable to the Village's rate schedule
shall be that included in the Village's retail rates of $0.0720 per kWh.
      (3)   Monthly determination of power supply cost adjustment.  Each month,
the Village's running three-month average power supply cost per kWh shall be
determined by dividing (i) the sum of the previous two and current month's
total power supply costs from all suppliers, plus the sum of the previous two
and current month's costs associated with ownership and operation of generating
facilities owned in whole, or in part, by the Village, plus the sum of the
previous two and current month's transmission related charges and service fees,
by (ii) the total energy delivered to the Village in the previous two months
and current month.  If said power supply cost per kWh is above or below $0.0720
per kWh (determination to four decimal places or $0.0000), the resultant
differential shall be multiplied by 1.10 to compensate for system energy
losses, and shall be applied to each customer's billable kWh.
      (4)   Excise (kilowatt-hour) tax adjustment.  The electric rates and
charges, including the private outdoor lighting rate, shall be adjusted by an
amount equal to the excise (kilowatt-hour) tax imposed on the Village's
electric distribution system under Ohio R.C. 5727.81.  Said adjustment shall
become effective with the bills that include May 1, 2001, as part of the usage
period and shall thereafter be automatically adjusted to reflect any change in
the kilowatt-hour tax imposed by Ohio R.C. 5727.81.
   (h)   Interconnection Agreement, Installation and Limitation of On-site
Solar and Wind Generators.
      (1)   Application for interconnection and interconnection agreement. 
Prior to the installation and connection of any on-site solar and/or wind
generator, the customer must first submit an application for interconnection to
the Village for review and approval and, following approval of the application
of interconnection, must enter into an interconnection agreement with the
Village, as prescribed by the Village Manager.
      (2)   Application fee; Village to install bi-directional meter.  The
application fee will be the cost of the installation of a bi-directional meter
plus fifty dollars ($50.00) for installation. Village Electric Department Staff
will be responsible for the installation of the bi-directional meter prior to
or at the time of interconnection. 
   (i)   Small Power Production Rate; Rate SPP.
      (1)   Availability and applicability. This schedule is applicable to the
purchase of power from customers that have entered into an interconnection
agreement with the Village to install an on-site generating facility behind the
customer's meter. All other electric service which the customer may require
from Village shall be furnished under Village's other applicable electric rate
schedules or by special agreement.
      (2)   Rate. The purchase price for energy supplied to Village by
customer's on-site generating facility shall be the Village's average power
supply cost per kWh purchased during the immediately prior calendar year. The
monthly payment/credit to the customer operating the on-site generating
facility shall be equal to the Village's average power supply cost per kWh
purchased during the immediately prior calendar year multiplied by the
kilowatt-hours supplied to the Village by customer's on-site generating
facility during the monthly billing period.
      (3)   Supplied energy: Energy supplied by the on-site generating facility
shall be determined by means of bi-directional metering installed at the point
of interconnection with the Village and customer and shall reflect only the
amount of energy supplied to Village. All energy supplied to customer by
Village shall be billed in accordance with Village's applicable rate schedule.

percent shall be added to any bill paid after the due date.
   (f)   All sewer fund receipts above the operational and maintenance funds
generated by this change in rates shall be periodically calculated and
transferred from the sewer fund to the sewer capital improvements fund which
will be established to be used exclusively for replacements and other capital
needs of the sewer system.
   (g)   For those residents who apply and are accepted, the Village utility
billing office will use that customer's water use in the preceding months of
December, January and February as a base line, and will compare it to their use
for the following June, July and August. Any summer use that reflects higher
consumption than the customer’s baseline months of December, January and
February will be deducted from that customer's sewer charges up to a maximum
adjustment of 6,000 gallons. The adjustment will be made in September, based on
that customer's actual meter readings to be reflected on the October bill. To
qualify to receive the adjustment, the customer must use the water for an
approved purpose, such as yard and garden watering that would typically result
in a higher water usage during summer months. Since this adjustment is used for
outdoor watering in summer months, it is only offered to those who have outdoor
areas. Apartments and other multi-unit housing situations that do not have an
outdoor area will not be eligible to receive any adjustment. In the case of a
complex that does have areas appropriate for watering, when applying, the
landlord shall designate the account to which the adjustment should be made.
   (h)   Sewer adjustment meters, designed for the purpose of measuring larger
amounts of water used to irrigate and therefore not entering the sanitary sewer
system, are permitted.  The amounts measured by such meters shall be deducted
from the sewer portion of the utility bill.  Such meters shall be purchased
from the list of those approved by the Village from private vendors.  All sewer
adjusting meters must meet the specifications established by the Village and
shall be owned and maintained by the property owner.  The meters shall be
installed in a manner as to register water that does not enter the sanitary
sewer system in any way.  Such installation shall meet with the standards of
the Village and shall be inspected by the Village upon completion.  Sewer
adjustment credits will only be allowed after inspection and approval of the
meter by the Village.  Any change in the installation after inspection shall
require a new inspection and approval.  Failure to promptly obtain a new
inspection and approval shall disqualify any adjustment credits from the date
of the initial approval of the meter until the new installation is approved. 
The Village Manager may use a permitting process to keep a record of these
meters and may adopt reasonable rules and regulations as needed for
implementing this policy, including a reasonable fee for obtaining a permit and
inspection from time to time.

1222.01  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPEN SPACE PROGRAM.
   The Village of Yellow Springs Open Space Land Program, established by
Ordinance 77-42, exists for the purpose of acquiring properties to be protected
by appropriate conservation easements, after which they will become a permanent
part of such Program. Such properties may have value in one or more of the
following categories, although they are not required to do so:
   (a)   Lands that contain scenic, natural, geological, historical,
agricultural or recreational importance;
   (b)   Lands that contain, or have the potential to contain, ecosystems of
educational or scientific value;
   (c)   Wetlands, flood plains or other lands necessary for the protection of
water quality;
   (d)   Lands of historical value, or which lie adjacent to lands of
historical value,  that are necessary for the protection of their qualities of
historical interest;
   (e)   Lands that have potential to be a part of community, County, regional,
State or national parks or greenway systems;
   (f)   Lands that are valuable to the community as open space due to their
proximity to developing areas or their value in creating visual and geographic
separation between the community and surrounding activities;
   (g)   Lands that are within the designated Open Space Program Map, or as
outlined in the Comprehensive Development Plan (Ordinance 77-42).
(Ord. 92-8.  Passed 5-4-92.)
1222.02  ACQUISITION OF OPEN SPACE LANDS.
   The Village Manager is hereby designated as the Village's agent to search
out and negotiate the purchase of lands or other real estate rights, including,
but not limited to, conservation easements, options, rights of first refusal or
land contracts for the Open Space Program. The terms of any such transaction
negotiated must be approved by Village Council at a legal meeting.
(Ord. 92-8.  Passed 5-4-92.)
1222.03  CONSERVATION EASEMENTS; DESIGNATION OF HOLDERS AND ENFORCERS THEREOF.
   The Village may elect to hold and enforce the terms of any conservation
easement or other property right created or acquired in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. Alternatively, the Village may elect to assign the
rights, duties and obligations of any conservation easement or other real
estate right intended to carry out the goals of the Open Space Program to the
Tecumseh Land Preservation Association (Tecumseh Land Trust), a charitable
corporation exempt from Federal taxation under section 501(e) of the Internal
Revenue Code and qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the same, organized for
the purpose of preserving scenic and historic lands and natural environmental
systems, or to another qualified corporation or agency, to hold and enforce.
The holder of any such rights shall enforce its terms through appropriate legal
actions, including, but not limited to, injunction or civil suit. Any such
legal action shall be brought by the holder and enforcer of the easement or
other property right in its own name on behalf of the Village and residents of
the Village.
(Ord. 92-8.  Passed 5-4-92.)
1222.04  PREPARATION AND PURPOSE OF CONSERVATION EASEMENTS.
   After acquisition of title or other property right to any land as a part of
the Open Space Program, the Village Manager shall cause a suitable conservation
easement, modeled on that cited in Resolution 92-12, for application to the
land in question, to be prepared by the entity which is to become the holder
and enforcer of it. Matters to be considered in the preparation of such
easement include, but are not limited to, the various features of the land, its
location, current and historic uses, topography, environmental characteristics
and its propensities for providing ecological value to the community. Such
easement shall have for its purpose the protection of the acquired land for
permanent inclusion in the Open Space Program as cited in Section
1222.02.
(Ord. 92-8.  Passed 5-4-92.)
1222.05  CONVEYANCE AND RECORDING OF CONSERVATION EASEMENTS.
   The completed conservation easement shall be conveyed to the Village, the
Tecumseh Land Trust or such other agent designated by Village Council, and
recorded in the official records of the County Recorder's Office. In the event
that the Village elects to be the holder and enforcer of the easement, the deed
whereby that easement is placed of record shall contain language that clearly
sets forth the intent that the easement shall not be merged with the fee simple
title to the property and shall remain a separate and distinct charge upon the
property. The easement shall be recorded at a time selected by Village Council,
but in every case the easement shall be recorded before the fee simple title is
sold, conveyed or transferred to any other party.
(Ord. 92-8.  Passed 5-4-92.)
1222.06  DISPOSITION OF LANDS SUBJECT TO CONSERVATION EASEMENTS.
   Following Council approval of a suitable conservation easement, property
acquired to be part of the Open Space Program may be resold. Such sale shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:
   (a)   Public notice shall be given in the official publication instrument
used by the Village of Yellow Springs for its other legal advertising, at least
once a week for three weeks, and at least one time a week for three weeks on
different days of the week in at least one other newspaper.
   (b)   No offer shall be formally accepted by Village Council, nor shall any
other sale commitment be made until a minimum of thirty days have passed from
the first date of publication.
   (c)   All advertisements and offers for sale shall stipulate that the
proffered land is subject to the above cited conservation easement, and any
person who makes an offer to buy the subject land must acknowledge in writing
its existence and his or her familiarity with it.
   (d)   Prior to offering any land for sale, Council shall establish a minimum
acceptable price.
   (e)   Subject to the above limitations, Village Council may elect to sell
the property by means of:
      (1)   The services of an agent (realtor, broker or other) whose method of
selection and terms of engagement shall be determined by Council, in which case
the effective date of the listing shall follow the period prescribed for public
advance notice of sale;
      (2)   A sealed bid; or
      (3)   Public auction.
   (f)   Village Council may, in determining the best bid, consider, in
addition to any cash offer, any offer of other land or real estate rights (e.g.
a conservation easement) on land having value as a constituent of the Village's
Open Space Program.
   (g)   If no acceptable bids or offers are received, Village Council may
decide to hold the land, attempt to sell it later or try selling it by another
method.
   (h)   The Village shall require that the buyer obtain a title examination at
the buyer's expense prior to closing.
(Ord. 92-8.  Passed 5-4-92;  Ord. 93-6.  Passed 5-17-93.)
1222.07  COOPERATION WITH TECUMSEH LAND TRUST.
   In those instances when the Village will be cooperating with the Tecumseh
Land Trust or other entity in the acquisition, protection and sale of property,
the Village shall first negotiate and approve a memorandum of understanding
with such entity stipulating the roles and responsibilities of each party in
this particular transaction. This memorandum of understanding shall be based
upon the model memorandum attached to original Ordinance 92-8 as exhibit B and
incorporated herein by reference.
(Ord. 92-8.  Passed 5-4-92.)

required, shall be provided on rear lot lines and along side lot lines in
addition to those required by the developer.
      (6)   Lots. Every lot shall abut on a street and double frontage lots
shall be avoided except where such lots will reduce curb cuts on heavily
traveled thoroughfares. Area, dimensions and layout of lots shall be in
conformity with the Zoning Code and applicable provisions of Article 5 of the
Subdivision Regulations of Greene County, Ohio, as amended, excluding Section
518(G). Uncommon lot configurations may be incorporated into a development
where such division poses no apparent nuisance and the Commission deems it
appropriate. Approval of such lots shall be granted upon review of the
following additional criteria:
         A.   Adequate access to such lots is provided and poses no nuisance to
adjoining lots. Adequate access shall accommodate emergency needs, parking and
any other requirements specific to the location.
         B.   The relation to the adjoining lots is acceptable in that required
setbacks can be maintained, adequate privacy is preserved and apparent
nuisances (light, noise) are avoided.
         C.   A minimum frontage of twenty feet shall be required for all such
lots.
         D.   Uncommon lot configurations are permitted access on local streets
only.

Subdivision Regulations.
         B.   Existing trees over two inches in caliper may be used to satisfy
these requirements.
         C.   The minimum size (trunk caliper) for new trees shall be no less
than one and one-half inches.
         D.   The developer shall be required to maintain the trees for one 
year after the trees are planted and to replace any tree that dies within such
one-year period. At the end of one year, the trees become the responsibility of
the Village of Yellow Springs.

intersections, twenty-five feet from utility poles and ten feet from fire
hydrants.
         G.   Tree lawns shall be a minimum of six feet.
      (8)   Interior landscaping. All subdivisions shall include an interior
landscaping plan that shall consist primarily of new tree planting or the
preservation of existing trees and/or hedges within the development site.
         A.   Preservation of existing landscaping materials. All trees having
a trunk diameter of six inches or greater, as measured twenty-four inches from

the specific location.
         B.   Preservation of exempted trees.  It is encouraged that exempted
trees subject to destruction be preserved by relocation and replanting whenever
possible.
         C.   Tree planting requirements for all new developments. The

   (b)   Proposed large scale neighborhood unit developments and similar
unusual developments may require the reservation or dedication of such
additional areas or sites of a character, extent and location suitable for
needs of community facilities created by such particular development where it
is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   It is encouraged that efforts be made to preserve natural vegetation
areas, and it is further encouraged that, whenever possible, heavily wooded
areas be designated as park reserves. Consideration shall be given to laying
out streets, lots, structures and parking areas to avoid the unnecessary
destruction of heavily wooded areas or outstanding tree specimens.
(Ord. 91-12.  Passed 12-2-91.)
1226.08  CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Public improvements relating to streets, sanitary sewerage, storm
sewerage, water distribution, electric distribution, fire protection, etc.,
shall be in accordance with applicable Greene County regulations, especially
those found in Articles 5 and 8 of the Subdivision Regulations of Greene
County, Ohio, as amended.
   (b)   The subdivider shall design and construct improvements according to
not less than the standards outlined in this chapter and other pertinent
regulations. The work shall be done under Village supervision, and inspection
shall be completed within the time fixed as agreed upon by the Village Manager
or his or her designee.
   (c)   Minimum requirements for materials and installation procedures for
storm sewers and roads shall be in compliance with the current construction and
material specifications in Articles 5 and 8 of the Subdivision Regulations of
Greene County, Ohio, as amended.
   (d)   Minimum requirements for materials and installation procedures for

(Ord. 2019-11.  Passed 4-15-19.)
1226.09  BOND FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   In order for the Village to be assured that the construction and
installation of improvements, such as street surfacing, curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water supply, electric supply, street
signs, street trees and interior landscaping, will be installed according to
the required standards, the subdivider shall agree:
      (1)   To construct all improvements directly affecting the subdivision,
as required by the Village pursuant to the construction plan, approvals and the
posting of inspection fees, prior to final approval of the plat; or
      (2)   In lieu of completion of the improvements, to furnish a bond
executed by a reputable surety company or a certified check or irrevocable
letter of credit, equal to the cost of construction of such improvements as
shown on plans and based on an itemized estimate of the construction costs
prepared by the engineer for the developer, submitted in triplicate, and
subject to the final approval of the Village Manager or his or her designee.
   Before a subdivision plan is given final approval by the Village Council,
the developer shall either have installed public improvements or have executed
a performance bond, certified check or irrevocable letter of credit with the
Village of Yellow Springs covering the estimated cost of required improvements.
Bonds shall be kept in the office of the Village Manager. A performance bond or
cash deposit shall run to Yellow Springs and shall provide that the subdivider,
his or her heirs, successors and assigns, or agent or servant, will comply with
all applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of this chapter
and other pertinent regulations, and will faithfully perform and complete the
work of constructing such facilities or improvements in accordance with such
laws and regulations.
   (b)   If the construction or installation of any improvement or facility,
for which a guarantee has been made by bond, is not completed within two years
from the date of final approval of the record plan, the developer may request
that the Village Council grant an extension of six months, provided that such
developer can show reasonable cause for inability to complete said improvements
within the required two years. The extension shall not exceed six months. The
request for an extension of time shall be accompanied by revised cost estimates
of construction to be completed. The Village Council, at such time, may require
the posting of a revised bond to cover increased costs. At the expiration of
the six month-extension, the Village will use as much of the bond or cash
deposit as is necessary to complete the construction of the improvements.
   (c)   As required improvements are completed, approved and accepted, the
Village Manager may, with concurrence of the appropriate inspection officials
(s), reduce the amount of the performance bond or cash deposit. Twenty-five
percent of the cash deposit or performance bond shall not be released until all
construction, installation and improvements required by the subdivider's
contract have been completed and accepted by the Village Council.  The
developer must provide “as- built” construction drawings to the Village prior
to the release of any remaining bond and/or cash deposit. Performance bonds or
cash deposits for roads and storm drainage, electric improvements and water and
sanitary sewer improvements shall not be released independently.
   (d)   Periodic inspections during the installation of improvements shall be
made by the Village Manager or his or her designee to insure conformity with
the approved plans and specifications as required by this chapter and other
regulations.  The subdivider shall notify proper administrative officials at
least forty-eight hours before each phase of the improvements is ready for
inspection.  Normally these inspections for street and storm drainage shall be
as follows:
      (1)   Street coring operations;
      (2)   Storm sewer and culvert installation;
      (3)   Construction of manholes and catch basins;
      (4)   Inspection of curb and gutter forms prior to placing of concrete
and sidewalks;
      (5)   Placing of concrete for curb and gutter and sidewalks;
      (6)   Sub-base for street construction;
      (7)   Placing of each lift of base;
      (8)   During each phase of road surfacing operation; and
      (9)   Erecting road name signs.
   Inspections for sanitary sewers and/or water, and electric shall be as
prescribed by specifications approved by the Village Manager.
   The absence of an inspector from a plat during construction shall not
relieve the subdivider from full responsibility under this section.
   (e)   When the required improvements have been completed, the developer
shall notify the Village Manager, in writing, of his or her desire for final
inspection. Upon certification of acceptable completion of the installation of
the required improvements by the Village Manager, the Village Manager shall
issue a letter to the subdivider, or to his or her agent, and such letter shall
be sufficient evidence for the release by the Village of Yellow Springs of the
performance bond.
   (f)   When the Village Manager, following inspection of a subdivision,
certifies to the Village Council that all improvements have been constructed in
accordance with Village specifications, the Village Council may proceed to
accept the public improvements.  Improvements will be accepted only after a
bond or other sufficient surety has been posted guaranteeing maintenance of the
required subdivision improvements, for one year, according to installation
specifications.  Such maintenance bond shall be in an amount equal to ten
percent of estimated construction cost and shall run from the date of
acceptance of improvements by Village Council to one year thereafter. 
Maintenance bonds may be released by Council after receiving certification from
the Village Manager that improvements continue to meet specifications after one
year beyond their acceptance.
   (g)   Whenever public improvements have not been constructed in accordance
with specifications as established, the Village Council may exercise its right
of foreclosure under the bond. If, in the opinion of the Village's authorized
inspector, installations are improper or inadequate, a stop order shall be
issued.  The developer may appeal the inspector's findings to the Village
Manager within forty-eight hours. Failure to comply will be deemed a violation
of these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 2019-12.  Passed 4-15-19.)
1226.10  VARIATIONS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may grant variations from these Subdivision
Regulations by the affirmative vote of three members, subject to limitations as
follows:
      (1)   That specific conditions and circumstances exist which are
particular to the land and which are not generally applicable to other lands
within the Village;
      (2)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of these
Regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
property owners;
      (3)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
      (4)   That granting of the variation requested would provide the minimum
variation necessary to grant relief from the special circumstances;
      (5)   That granting of the variation will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of these Regulations and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   (b)   In granting variations or modifications, the Planning Commission may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the requirements so varied or modified.
(Ord. 91-12.  Passed 12-2-91.)

with the required data, the Zoning Administrator shall cause notice of the
time, place and purpose of the hearing to be given, in writing by first class
mail, to the applicant(s), to owners of property contiguous to and directly
across the street from the property that is the subject of the replat
application.  The notice shall be given at least seven days in advance of the
hearing, noting the request and the property location. The name and address of
any property owner on the most recent property record of the Greene County
Auditor shall be the address used for public notification.  If the address is
unclear or uncertain, the property owner may be notified by legal notice
published one time at least seven days in advance of any hearing, listing the
address of the property to receive notification.
   (c)   Upon approval, the replat shall be submitted by the applicant to the
Greene County Recorder for incorporation into the Official Tax Map records
within 90 days.
   (d)   The applicant will be held responsible for any negative impact on

APPENDIX B
VILLAGE OF YELLOW SPRINGS
RECOMMENDED TREES
The following list of trees has been placed on file with the Village for use by
developers, businesses and individuals seeking advice on the types of trees to
use:
Some consider streets more attractive when they contain only one kind of tree
species. However, the pest risk is multiplied in that situation; therefore,
such plantings should be made with caution.
Tree selection is extremely important in ensuring survivability and long-term
health of trees.  The most important thing to remember when selecting trees is
to match the tree to the site, not the site to the tree.  Where you have space
for a large species always plant a large species.  It is the large tree species
that will give the Village of Yellow Springs the most benefits in the long
run.  In addition, they tend to be longer lived than smaller species when
planted in the right location. 
Tree species diversity is important to a healthy, resilient community tree
population, as well as age diversity.  A good rule to follow for the community
urban forest as a whole is the 10-20-30 Rule. The breakdown to shoot for is no
more than 30% of a single family, 20% of a single genus (maple, oak, etc.), and
no more than 10% of a single species.  This can be accomplished by street or by
the community as a whole. 
The trees suggested in this list were selected because their characteristics
make them suitable for urban and home use. The criteria used include: deep
roots, minimal fruit or leaf litter, regular and predictable form, stress
tolerance, disease and insect resistance, transplanting facility, availability
and ornamental value.
Due to the culture and goals set forth by the Yellow Springs community, native
tree species should be given preference where a native species will thrive
within the constraints of diversity goals. All of the trees listed below are
good for planting in both tree lawn areas and for landscape use in yards.
Small Trees with single-stem forms (under 25 feet at maturity) - If planting in
the tree lawn, the width should be at least three feet.

1240.02   Purpose.
1240.03   Scope.
1240.04   Effect of other regulations.
1240.05   Relationship to other codes, ordinances or agreements.
1240.06   Interpretation.
1240.07   Rules applying to the text.
1240.08   Severability.
1240.01   TITLE.
   This code and all its provisions, codified as Title Four, Zoning, of Part
Twelve, the Planning and Zoning Code, shall be known and may be cited as "The
Zoning Code of the Village of Yellow Springs, Ohio;" or by its shorter titles,
"The Yellow Springs Zoning Code" or "Zoning Code."
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1240.02   PURPOSE.
   This code shall have the purposes prescribed in Ohio R.C. Chapter 713, and
is enacted for the following additional purposes:
   (a)   To promote the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity
and general welfare;
   (b)   To conserve and protect property and  owner investment;
   (c)   To promote the most appropriate use of land;
   (d)   To guide the density of population;
   (e)   To manage and support efficient travel modes;
   (f)   To provide a method of administration and to prescribe penalties for
violations of provisions of this code; and
   (g)   To support the Village Comprehensive Plan and its key principles,
including:
      (1)   Make land use provisions and decisions that make possible the
restoration, maintenance and retention of a population, employment and economic
base that is capable of sustaining the community;
      (2)   Make provisions for a range of housing opportunities, costs and
choices that provide safe, quality housing for current and potential residents
of all income levels, paying particular attention to modest cost housing to
ensure maintenance of income diversity in our town;
      (3)   Support land use development in which residents can live, walk and
bicycle to work, to learn, to shop, to worship and to play;
      (4)   Encourage collaborative land use development that honors both
landowners' rights to a fair return on the value of their land and the
community's desire to determine how and where it wants to grow. The
Comprehensive Plan should be the guideline used by policy makers when making
decisions on land use and zoning matters.
      (5)   Promote compatible mixed-use land use adjacencies that foster
synergies (not disharmonies) among residential, commercial, retail, educational
and industrial uses;
      (6)   Preserve open space, naturally occurring topographic features and
vegetation, critical environmental areas and historic buildings and land uses;
      (7)   Promote a transportation infrastructure that supports safety,
compatibility and accessibility for pedestrian, bicycle and motorized vehicles;
      (8)   Direct new residential development, should it occur, to areas
either already served by existing infrastructure - water, sanitary sewer,
electric and streets - and/or to yet undeveloped areas within current Village
borders where compatible land use adjacencies already exist. New development
shall be encouraged within the Village through infill and greater density and
it shall not be considered outside the Urban Service Area.  The Village will
work with the Township to balance controlled development with goals for
preservation of the Jacoby Greenbelt; and
      (9)   Promote new retail, commercial and industrial development in areas
in the community where these land uses already exist (are already zoned for)
and/or to yet undeveloped areas within current Village borders. New development
shall be encouraged within the Village through infill and greater density and
it shall not be considered outside the Urban Service Area. The Village will
work with the Township to balance controlled development with goals of
preservation of the Jacoby Greenbelt.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1240.03   SCOPE.
   The provisions of this code shall apply to all lands within the municipal

1240.04   EFFECT OF OTHER REGULATIONS.
   The regulations of this code shall be in addition to any other regulations
in effect in the Village. All building, subdividing, and uses within any
district shall satisfy all building, planning, platting, zoning, and any other
related regulations.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1240.05   RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CODES, ORDINANCES OR AGREEMENTS.
   This code does not repeal or annul any code, ordinance, regulation, permit,

assigned to them in
Chapter 1284, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning.
   (b)   Rules of Construction. The following rules of construction apply to
this code:
      (1)   The particular shall control the general and the use of a general
term shall not be taken to have the same meaning as another specific term. For
example, a "dry cleaning retail establishment" shall not be interpreted to be
the same as a "retail business supplying commodities on the premises," if each
term is listed as a separate and distinct use.
      (2)   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text of this code and any caption or illustration, the text shall control.
      (3)   A building or structure includes any and all of its parts.
      (4)   The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for," "designed for,"
"intended for," "maintained for" and "occupied for."
      (5)   The word "shall" is always mandatory and not discretionary. The
word "may" is permissive.
      (6)   The word "person" includes any individual, corporation,
partnership, incorporated association, limited liability company or any other
similar entity.
      (7)   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a
regulation involves two or more items, conditions, provisions or events
connected by the conjunctions "and," "or" or "either...or," the conjunction
shall be interpreted as follows:
         A.   "And" indicates that all of the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events apply.
         B.   "Or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions
or events may apply singly or in any combination.
         C.   "Either...or" indicates that the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events apply singly but not in combination.
   (c)   Terms not defined in this code shall have the meaning customarily
assigned to them.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1240.08   SEVERABILITY.
   If a provision of this zoning code is found to be invalid by any court of

1242.03   DISTRICT BOUNDARIES INTERPRETED.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts, as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   When the exact boundaries of a district are uncertain, they shall be
determined by use of the scale on the zoning map.
   (b)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow those centerlines.
   (c)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following those lot lines.
   (d)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow the shoreline. In the event of change in the shoreline, the boundary
shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline. Boundaries indicated as
approximately following the center line of streams, rivers or other bodies of
water shall be construed to follow the centerline. Any use of structures
extending into or over a water body shall be subject to the same zoning
restrictions as the adjoining land.
   (e)   When a right-of-way is vacated, the districts adjoining each side are
respectively extended to the center of the area so vacated.
   (f)   If the rules above are not sufficient to resolve the issue, the
Planning Commission shall make the determination by resolution.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1242.04   ANNEXED LAND.

1242.06   USES NOT LISTED.
   (a)   A use that is not listed, either by right or by conditional approval,
in a zoning district, shall not be permitted in that district and shall only be
permitted in a district where it is specifically listed as either a use by
right or by conditional approval.
   (b)   If a proposed use of land or building is not specified by this code in
any district, the Village Manager or designee shall determine if the use is
similar to a permitted or conditional land use authorized in the district in
which the land or building is located.  If the use is found to be similar, it
may be established in accordance with the requirements and procedures
established in the code for the similar use. The Village Manager or designee
shall notify the Planning Commission of this action, who shall then determine
if the code should be amended to specifically include the use.
   (c)   Alternatively, the Village Manager or designee may refer the
determination to the Planning Commission in the first instance.
   (d)   The determination by the Village Manager or designee, or the Planning

1250.03   Spatial requirements.
1250.04   Site development regulations.
1250.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   "B-1," Central Business District. The B-1 District serves as the focal
point for the social and commercial activities of the Village. The integration
of business, institutional, public, quasi-public, cultural, residential and
other related uses is permitted and encouraged. Uses in this district, for the
most part, are intended to promote pedestrian movement and social interaction
and should be of a scale and character that is consistent with the small town
ambiance of the Village.
   (b)   "B-2," General Business District. The B-2 District accommodates
general retail and/or auto-dependent businesses. Uses within this district
typically require high visibility, major arterial frontage, good access and
ample parking. While these uses are provided for, the B-2 District is intended
to be limited to a confined area so as to prevent the creation of a commercial
strip and a proliferation of uses that would detract from the central business
hub of the community.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1250.02   SCHEDULE OF USES.
   Buildings or land shall not be used and buildings shall not be erected,
except for the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided for in this
code. Land and/or buildings in the districts indicated at the top of
Table 1250.02 may be used for the purposes denoted by the following
abbreviations:
   (a)   Permitted Use (P). Land and/or buildings in this district may be used
by right.
   (b)   Conditional Use (C). Land and/or buildings in this district may be
permitted only if conditional use approval is granted, upon a finding that the
general requirements of
Chapter 1262 are met.
   (c)   Specific Conditions. Indicates requirements or conditions, as listed
in
Chapter 1262, are applicable to specific uses.

1252.01   Purpose.
1252.02   Schedule of uses.
1252.03   Spatial requirements.
1252.04   Site development regulations.
1252.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   "I-1," Mixed Industrial District.  The I-1 District is intended to
provide dedicated locations within the community for office, research,
knowledge-based industry, services, light manufacturing and related uses that
offer employment opportunities and create economic vitality for the Village and
its residents.
   (b)   "I-2," Industrial District.  The I-2 District establishes a location
for industrial and heavy commercial uses that provide significant employment
opportunities within the Village.  Uses in this district tend to be more
intensive than those in the I-1 District and due to the potential for large
truck traffic, late hours of operation and other potentially deleterious
effects on the surroundings and the community may require conditional use
review.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1252.02   SCHEDULE OF USES.
   Buildings or land shall not be used and buildings shall not be erected,
except for the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided for in this
code.  Land and/or buildings in the I-1 and I-2 districts may be used for the
purposes denoted by the following abbreviations in
Table 1252.02:
   (a)   Permitted Use (P). Land and/or buildings in this district may be used
by right.
   (b)   Conditional Use (C). Land and/or buildings in this district may be
permitted only if conditional use approval is granted, upon a finding that the
general requirements of
Chapter 1262 are met.
   (c)   Specific Conditions. Indicates requirements or conditions, as listed
in
Chapter 1262, are applicable to specific uses.

1254.08   Appeals.
1254.01   PURPOSE.
   The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is established as an optional
development tool to permit flexibility in the regulation of land development;
to encourage innovation in land use, form of ownership and variety of design,
layout and type of structures constructed; to achieve economy and efficiency in
the use of land; to preserve significant natural, historical and architectural
features and open space; to promote efficient provision of public services and
utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts; to provide better housing,
employment and business opportunities particularly suited to residents; to
encourage development of convenient recreational facilities; and to encourage
the use and improvement of existing sites when the uniform regulations
contained in other zoning districts alone do not provide adequate protection
and safeguards for the property and surrounding areas.  It is the further
intent of the PUD regulations to promote a higher quality of development than
can be achieved from conventional zoning requirements in furtherance of the
vision and goals of the adopted Comprehensive Plan and Vision: Yellow Springs
and Miami Township.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1254.02   QUALIFYING CONDITIONS.
   In order to qualify for PUD approval, the project must satisfy the
conditions of this section. It is the applicant's responsibility to
demonstrate, in writing, that each of the following criteria is or will be met
by the proposed PUD:
   (a)   Recognizable Benefit.  A PUD shall achieve recognizable and
substantial benefits that would not be possible under the existing zoning
classification(s).  At least three of the following benefits shall be accrued
to the community as a result of the proposed PUD:
      (1)   Preservation of significant natural features;
      (2)   A complementary mix of land uses or housing types;
      (3)   Extensive open space and recreational amenities;
      (4)   Connectivity of open space with new or existing adjacent greenway
or trail corridors;
      (5)   Preservation of small town appeal;
      (6)   Improvements to public streets or other public facilities that
mitigate traffic and/or other development impacts;
      (7)   Coordinated development of multiple small parcels; or
      (8)   Removal or renovation of blighted buildings, sites or contamination
clean-up.
   (b)   Size.  Each PUD shall contain a minimum of five acres; provided sites
containing less than five acres may be considered for rezoning to PUD, if the
Village Council determines that the site will advance the purposes of the PUD
District. When determining the appropriateness of areas less than the
applicable minimum required, the Village Council shall determine that:
      (1)   Rezoning the area to PUD will not result in a significant adverse
effect upon nearby or adjacent Village lands;
      (2)   The proposed uses will complement the character of the surrounding
area;
      (3)   The purpose and qualifying conditions of the PUD District can be
achieved within a smaller area; and
      (4)   The PUD is not being used as a means to circumvent conventional
zoning requirements.
   (c)   Utilities.  The PUD shall be served by public water and sanitary
sewer.
   (d)   Ownership.  The PUD application shall be filed by the property owner,
lessee or other person with legal interest in the property and written consent
by the owner. The proposed development shall be under unified ownership or
control, so one person or entity has proprietary responsibility for the full
completion of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation
of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or
deed restrictions indicating that the development will be completed in its
entirety as proposed.
   (e)   Comprehensive Plan and Vision.  Proposed uses and design of the PUD
shall be substantially consistent with the Village's adopted Comprehensive Plan
and the principles for land stewardship contained in the Vision: Yellow Springs
and Miami Township.
   (f)   Pedestrian Accommodation.  The PUD shall provide for integrated, safe
and abundant pedestrian and bicycle access and movement within the PUD and to
adjacent properties.
   (g)   Architecture.  Building forms, relationships, scale and styles shall
be harmonious and visually integrated.
   (h)   Traffic.  The PUD shall provide for safe and efficient vehicular
movement within, into and out of the PUD site. Traffic calming techniques,
parking lot landscaping, and other sustainable design solutions shall be
employed to improve traffic circulation, storm water management, pedestrian
safety and aesthetic appeal.
   (i)   Eligible Districts.  Land within any zoning district may qualify for
PUD zoning.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1254.03   PUD REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Permitted Uses. Any use permitted by right or conditional approval in
any zoning district may be permitted within a PUD, subject to the provisions of
Section
1254.02, Qualifying Conditions, and the requirements of this section.
   (b)   Minimum Lot Size and Zoning Requirements.  Lot area, width, setbacks,
height, lot coverage, minimum floor area, parking, landscaping, lighting and
other requirements for the district applicable to the proposed use, as provided
in
Table 1254.03, shall be applicable for all such uses within a PUD, unless
modified in accordance with Section
1254.03(d). In the case of a mix of uses, the zoning requirements applicable to
each use category shall apply to that use.

preliminary development plan shall be null and void. In addition, the Planning
Commission or Village Council may initiate a rezoning of the property to
another zoning district.
      (3)   Subdivision plat. For any PUD requiring subdivision plat approval,
the subdivision plat shall be submitted simultaneously with the final
development plan and reviewed concurrently as part of the PUD.
      (4)   Review and action. The Planning Commission shall review the final
development plan in relation to its conformance with the preliminary
development plan and any conditions or modifications attached to the PUD
rezoning by the Village Council.  If it is determined that the final plan does
not substantially conform with the preliminary development plan, the review
process shall be conducted as a preliminary development plan review, in
accordance with Section
1254.05(b). If the final development plan is consistent with the approved
preliminary development plan, the Planning Commission shall review the final
plan in accordance with the standards for site plan review, Section
1268.06 and the PUD standards of Section
1254.06. The Planning Commission shall prepare a record of its findings and
shall approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications the final development
plan.
   (e)   PUD Agreement.
      (1)   Prior to issuance of any building permits or commencement of
construction on any portion of the PUD, the applicant shall enter into an
agreement with the Village, in recordable form, setting forth the applicant's
obligations with respect to the PUD.
      (2)   The agreement shall describe all improvements to be constructed as
part of the PUD and shall incorporate, by reference, the final development plan
with all required modifications, other documents which comprise the approved
PUD, and all conditions attached to the approval by the Village.
      (3)   A phasing plan shall also be submitted, if applicable, describing
the intended schedule for start and completion of each phase and the
improvements to be undertaken in each phase.
      (4)   The agreement shall also establish the remedies of the Village in
the event of default by the applicant in carrying out the PUD, and shall be
binding on all successors in interest to the applicant.

CHAPTER 1256
Overlay Districts
1256.01   Purpose.
1256.02   Floodplain Overlay District.
1256.03   Gateway Overlay District.
1256.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of the overlay districts is to establish regulations in
addition to the applicable regulations of the existing (underlying) zoning
districts that either supplement or replace those existing regulations.  The
overlay districts are applied in specific locations based on the environmental
features or important characteristics of the area, regardless of the
established zoning districts.
   (b)   Two overlay districts are established, as described in this chapter.
The boundaries of these districts shall be as described in the respective
sections and shown on the zoning map.  The requirements of this chapter are in
addition to and shall supplement those imposed on the same lands by any
underlying zoning provisions of this code or other codes of the Village.  These
regulations supersede all conflicting regulations of the underlying districts
to the extent of such conflict.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1256.02   FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent.
      (1)   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and achieve the public purposes,
these regulations are adopted.
      (2)   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare, and to:
         A.   Protect human life and health;
         B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
         F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
         G.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
         H.   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood-prone areas;
         I.   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
         J.   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
         K.   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
         L.   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (c)   Applicability.  These regulations shall apply to all areas of special
flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village as identified in subsection
(d) of this section, including any additional areas of special flood hazard
annexed by the Village.
   (d)   Basis for Establishing Flood Hazard Areas. For the purposes of these
regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Greene County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Greene County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective March 17, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1256.02(v), Subdivisions, Large Developments and PUDs.
      (4)   Any revisions to the above maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be part of these regulations. These maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village Municipal Building, Administration/ Planning
Office, Second Floor, 100 Dayton Street, Yellow Springs, Ohio.
   (e)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances, including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement, but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (f)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (g)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any lawfully made administrative decision. 
   (h)   Responsibilities of the Flood Administrator. A Flood Administrator
shall be appointed by the Village Council to administer and implement these
regulations. The duties and responsibilities of the Flood Administrator shall
include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Evaluate applications for permits to develop in special flood
hazard areas.
      (2)   Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide flood hazard and flood

existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA, must meet the development standards of these regulations.
   (i)   Floodplain Development Permits.  It shall be unlawful for any person
to begin construction or other development activity, including but not limited
to, filling, grading, construction, alteration, remodeling, or expanding any
structure; or altering any watercourse wholly within, partially within, or in
contact with any identified special flood hazard area until a floodplain
development permit is obtained from the Flood Administrator. The floodplain
development permit shall show that the proposed development activity conforms
to the provisions of these regulations. No permit shall be issued until the
requirements of these regulations have been met.
   (j)   Application.  An application for a floodplain development permit shall
be required for all development activities located wholly within, partially
within, or in contact with an identified special flood hazard area. An
application shall be made by the owner of the property or his or her authorized
agent on a form furnished for that purpose prior to commencing construction.
Where it is unclear whether a development site is in a special flood hazard
area, the Flood Administrator may require an application for a floodplain
development permit to determine the development's location. Such applications
shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Payment of a fee in an amount as established by the Village
Council.

      (1)   Complete application. After receipt of a complete application, the
Flood Administrator shall review the application to ensure that the standards
of these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit
application shall be processed until all information required in Section
1256.02(j) has been received by the Flood Administrator.
      (2)   Other permits. The Flood Administrator shall review all
applications to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those
Federal, State or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is
required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining such permits,
including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under Section 10
of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
      (3)   Approval. Within 30 days of receiving a complete application, the
Flood Administrator shall either approve or disapprove the application. If an
application is approved, a permit shall be issued. All floodplain development
permits shall be conditional upon the commencement of work within 12 months. A
floodplain development permit shall expire 12 months after issuance unless the
permitted activity has been substantially begun and is being pursued to
completion.
   (l)   Inspections. The Flood Administrator shall make periodic inspections
at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor

   (p)   Map Maintenance.
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data. To meet National Flood
Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved
by FEMA, and to ensure that Village flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1256.02(d) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the Village shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1256.02(v).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1256.02(p)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Flood Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Flood Administrator
shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from
FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1256.02(p)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Flood Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or plan metric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Village Manager, and may be
submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Flood Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the Village have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the Village Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represents the Village boundaries, include within such notification
a copy of a map of the Village suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (q)   Data Use and Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall apply
to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of special
flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Flood Administrator shall review
and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a Federal,
State, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Flood Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or a Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Flood Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation, as
provided in Section
1256.02(y).
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (r)   Substantial Damage Determination.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Flood Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Flood Administrator may implement other measures
to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures, materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.
   (s)   Use and Development Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction. The use and
development standards set forth in Sections
1256.02(t) through
1256.02(w) apply to development wholly within, partially within, or in contact
with any special flood hazard area as established in Section
1256.02(d) or
1256.02(q)(1).

acres, whichever is less.
      (5)   The applicant shall meet the requirement to submit technical data
to FEMA in Section
1256.02(p)(1)A.4. when a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis is completed that
generates base flood elevations as required by Section
1256.02(v)(4).
   (w)   Buildings, Structures and Vehicles.
      (1)   Residential structures.
         A.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Where a structure, including its foundation members, is elevated on fill to or
above the base flood elevation, the requirements for anchoring and construction
materials resistant to flood damage are satisfied.
         B.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with methods and materials resistant to flood damage.
         C.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be

         D.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the flood protection elevation. Where flood
protection elevation data are not available, the structure shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the highest
adjacent natural grade or flood of record, whichever is greater.
         E.   New construction and substantial improvements, including
manufactured homes, that do not have basements and that are elevated to the
flood protection elevation using pilings, columns, posts, or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to allow unimpeded movement of flood
waters may have an enclosure below the lowest floor provided the enclosure
meets the following standards:
            1.   Be used only for the parking of vehicles, building access, or
storage; and
            2.   Be designed and certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters; or
            3.   Have a minimum of two openings on different walls having a
total net area not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area, and the bottom of all such openings being no higher than one foot above
grade. The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings
or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood
waters.
         F.   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
         G.   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of this Section
1256.02(w)(1).
         H.   In AO Zones, new construction and substantial improvement shall
have adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters
around and away from the structure.
      (2)   Nonresidential structures.
         A.   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall meet the requirements of
Section
1256.02(w)(1)A. through C. and E. through H.
         B.   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to or above the level of the flood
protection elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall meet all of the following standards:
            1.   Be dry floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the
flood protection elevation;
            2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
            3.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, through the use of a Federal Emergency Management Agency
Floodproofing Certificate, that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with Section
1256.02(w)(2)B.1. and 2.
         C.   Where flood protection elevation data are not available, the
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least
two feet above the highest adjacent natural grade or flood of record, whichever
is greater.
      (3)   Accessory structures.  Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures containing no more than 600
square feet. Such structures must meet the following standards:
         A.   They shall not be used for human habitation;
         B.   They shall be constructed of flood-resistant materials;
         C.   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
         D.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
         E.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
         F.   They shall meet the opening requirements of Section
1256.02(w)(1)E.3.
      (4)   Recreational vehicles.  Recreational vehicles must meet at least
one of the following standards:
         A.   They shall not be located on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days in a calendar year; or
         B.   They must be fully licensed and ready for highway use.
      (5)   Above-ground gas or liquid storage tanks.  All above-ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (x)   Assurance of Flood-Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood-
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1256.02(p)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Village Manager of Yellow Springs and the
chief executive officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1256.02(x)(1)B.1., 3., 4., and 5.
         C.   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
bankfull stage. The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
            1.   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated
as a result of the proposed development, and certification by a registered
professional engineer that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
            2.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
            3.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Flood Administrator may
require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the Village,
specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required, it
shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
            4.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1256.02(p)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (y)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in practical difficulty may file an
application for a variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought, shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the Flood
Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to the Board
of Zoning Appeals.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain: name, address, and
telephone number of the applicant; legal description of the property; parcel
map; description of the existing use; description of the proposed use; location
of the floodplain; description of the variance sought; and reason for the
variance request.
         C.   All variance applications shall be accompanied by a fee set in
the schedule of fees adopted by the Village Council.
      (2)   Public hearing.  At the hearing the applicant shall present all
statements and evidence as the Board of Zoning Appeals requires. In considering
variance applications, the Board shall consider and make findings of fact on
all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following criteria:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Decision factors. Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (4)   Conditions. Upon consideration of the above factors and the
purposes of these regulations, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other considerations.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided items in Section
1256.02(y)(2) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure's lowest floor elevation will not meet the
requirements of this section and the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
      (6)   Procedure at hearings.
         A.   All testimony shall be given under oath.
         B.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
         C.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
         D.   The Flood Administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance.
         E.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
         F.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
         G.   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
         H.   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
      (7)   Appeals to Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals may appeal the decision to the Greene County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (z)   Violations.
      (1)   Compliance required.  No structure or land shall hereafter be
located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted,
enlarged or altered without full compliance with the terms of these regulations
and all other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of these regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for
a development permit as stated in Section
1256.02(o).  Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1256.02(z)(4).
      (2)   Conformance with approved plans.  Floodplain development permits
issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the Flood
Administrator authorize only the use, and arrangement, set forth in the
approved plans and applications or amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or
construction contrary to that authorized shall be deemed a violation of these
regulations and punishable in accordance with Section
1256.02(z)(4).
      (3)   Notice of violation. Whenever the Flood Administrator determines
there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall give
notice of that violation to the person responsible and the property owner, if
different from the person responsible, and order compliance with these
regulations. The notice shall be served in person; provided, this notice and
order shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy is sent by registered or
certified mail to the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place
of business, and/or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the
structure affected. The notice and order shall:
         A.   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
         B.   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or
sections of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial
action, which, if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these
regulations;
         C.   Specify a reasonable time for performance; and
         D.   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal.
      (4)   Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these regulations or
failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict
liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree misdemeanor. Any person
who violates these regulations or fails to comply with the requirements shall,
upon conviction, be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the Village.
Each day a violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing
contained in this section shall prevent the Village from taking other lawful
action, as necessary, to prevent or remedy a violation.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1256.03   GATEWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT.

1260.03   Driveway standards, access easements, parking and storage.
1260.04   Uses.
1260.05   Other provisions.
1260.01   BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Fences and Walls. Notwithstanding other provisions of this zoning
code, fences, walls and foliage are permitted in required yards under the
following conditions:
      (1)   The height shall not exceed four feet in the front yard, including
both front yards of a corner or through lot, except within the clear vision
triangle (see Section
1260.02(b)) which shall be three feet.
      (2)   Fences, walls and foliage adjacent to any public sidewalk shall be
set back at least one foot from the  inside of the sidewalk.
      (3)   Visibility into and out of any driveway or street shall remain
unobstructed.
      (4)   Within a side or rear yard in a Residential District, no fence or
wall shall be permitted to exceed a height of six feet, measured from the

      (5)   In Residential Districts, if both sides of the fence are not
identical, the finished side shall face the adjoining property.
      (6)   Fences in nonresidential districts shall be permitted up to eight
feet in height, provided for each foot exceeding six feet, there shall be a one
and one-half foot setback from side property lines.
      (7)   Barbed wire or electrically charged fences may be erected in
nonresidential districts, provided the electrically charged or barbed section
of the fence shall be no lower than seven feet above grade.
      (8)   Fences, walls or foliage erected or maintained above or within
utility easements shall be subject to removal, as necessary, to provide access
to such easements.
   (b)   Temporary Buildings and Structures.
      (1)   Construction buildings and structures, including trailers,
incidental to construction work on a lot, may be placed on that lot, subject to
the following:
         A.   Construction buildings and structures may only be used for the
storage of materials, tools, supplies and equipment, for construction
management and supervision offices, and for temporary on-site sanitation
facilities related to construction activity on the lot. An enclosed structure
for temporary sanitation facilities shall be required on all construction site.
         B.   No construction building or structure shall be used as a dwelling
unit.
         C.   A permit shall be obtained from the Zoning Administrator prior to
installation of a construction building or structure.
         D.   Construction buildings and structures shall be removed from the
site within 15 days after an occupancy permit is issued by the Zoning
Administrator for the permanent structure on the lot, or within 15 days after
the expiration of a building permit issued for construction on the lot.
      (2)   Sales offices or model homes may be placed on a lot subject to the
following:
         A.   A permit shall be obtained from the Zoning Administrator prior to
installation or construction. The permit shall specify the location of the
office and shall be valid for a period of up to one year. A temporary permit
may be renewed by the Zoning Administrator for up to two successive one-year
periods of less at the same location, if it is determined that the temporary
building is still incidental and necessary.
         B.   Only transactions related to the development in which the
temporary building is located shall be conducted within the building. General
offices for real estate, construction, development or other related businesses
associated with the project shall not be permitted.
   (c)   Unlawful Buildings and Uses. Any building, use or lot which has been
unlawfully constructed, occupied or created prior to the date of adoption of
this code shall continue to be unlawful, unless expressly permitted by this
zoning code. Such buildings, uses or lots shall not be considered to be
nonconforming and are not entitled to any consideration under the provisions of
Chapter 1282.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1260.02   DIMENSIONAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Average Front Setback.  The minimum front setback requirements for a
principal building in any Residential District may be reduced in accordance
with the following:
      (1)   Where two or more lots entirely or partially within 200 feet of a
subject lot, on the same side of the street and the same block, are occupied by
principal buildings whose existing front setback is less than required by the
zoning district, the average of the established setbacks for those buildings
shall be the minimum required front setback for the subject lot.
      (2)   In no case, however, shall the front yard setback for a garage,
whether attached or detached, be less than 20 feet in order to provide adequate
vehicle parking space in front of the garage without blocking a sidewalk or
otherwise impeding pedestrian movement.
   (b)   Clear Vision Corner.  Fences, walls, structures, shrubbery or other
potential obstructions to vision, except utility poles, lights and street
signs, shall not be permitted to exceed a height of three feet within a
triangular area formed by the intersection of the street right-of-way lines and
a line connecting two points located on those intersecting right-of-way lines
20 feet from the point of intersection with the right-of-way lines.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2971.jpg]
 
   (c)   Cul-de-sac Lots. In the case of lots abutting the turn-around radius
of a cul-de-sac street, the minimum required lot width shall be measured at the
required front setback line, provided all such cul-de-sac lots shall have a
minimum width of 40 feet at the front lot line.
   (d)   Height Exceptions.  Height limits specified elsewhere in this zoning
code shall not apply to:
      (1)    Churches, schools, hospitals and public buildings including, but
not limited to: libraries, museums, art galleries, fire stations or public
buildings of a cultural, recreational or administrative nature.
      (2)   Barns, silos or other buildings or structures on farms; church
spires, belfries, cupolas and domes; monuments; transmission towers; windmills;
chimneys; smokestacks; flagpoles; and radio towers, masts and aerials. These
structures shall be limited to 100 feet in height in any case, unless otherwise
permitted in this code.
      (3)   Structures needed as part of an industrial facility where the
manufacturing process requires a greater height; provided, however, that all
such structures shall be limited to 25% of the area of the lot and shall meet
all yard setback requirements for  a principal building, but in no case less
than 25 feet.
   (e)   Minimum Lot Frontage.  Any lot created after the effective date of
this code shall have frontage on an improved public street or approved private
street or access easement, equal to the minimum required lot width in the
zoning district in which it is located.  If an access easement is required to
reach the lot, the minimum required lot frontage may run along the inside
property line of the lot being accessed.  If the lot is located on a private
street or access easement, specific requirements for ingress/egress will apply
(Section
1260.03 ).  Approval for private street or access easements must be granted by
the Planning Commission.
   (f)   Required Yards or Lots.  No lot or lots in common ownership and no
yard, court, parking area or other space shall be so divided, altered or
reduced as to make the area or space less than the minimum size required by
this code.  If already less than the minimum size required, the area or space
shall not be further divided or reduced.
(Ord. 2018-43.  Passed 11-5-18.)
1260.03   DRIVEWAY STANDARDS, ACCESS EASEMENTS, PARKING AND STORAGE.
   (a)   On a legally zoned lot, there shall be no more than one driveway,
unless the lot is part of a Planned Unit (PUD) or Pocket Neighborhood
Development (PND).  If the frontage of the lot will be located along an access
easement, the access easement shall be recorded on the deed of all properties
which are subject to the easement and shall clearly specify the party or
parties that shall be responsible for the maintenance of the easement area.  An
additional curb cut for a second driveway shall only be permitted if the lot
frontage exceeds by 15 feet the minimum lot frontage requirement of the
respective zoning district.  The access easement shall provide lot frontage at
least equal to the minimum required lot frontage of that zoning district (see
diagram).

The Village of Yellow Springs shall have no responsibility for maintenance of
the private drive and/or turn-around.
      (1)   All driveways shall be constructed and subsequently maintained to
meet the following standards:
         A.   A driveway must commence at a dedicated road.

         E.   Utility easements for storm, sewer, water, electric and gas are
to be maintained along the back and side yard property lines as it was in the
original subdivision.
         F.   Free from overhead obstructions to a height of 13 feet 6 inches
and side-to-side obstructions to a width of 8 feet from the center line of the
driveway.
         G.   Any incline, decline, dip, hump and/or curve must take into
consideration the turning radius, ground clearance, and traveling envelope of
all vehicles to include emergency vehicles.
         H.   Addresses for properties on private drives or road access
easements must be clearly marked and visible from the public street.
      (2)   Any driveway in excess of 1,000 feet in length shall, in addition
to the conditions/standards outlined in division (a)(1) of this section, be
required to also meet the following conditions:
         A.   Have a vehicle pull-off near the mid-point, and additional pull-
offs for every 500 feet thereafter.
         B.   Have a turnaround at the end suitable for use by emergency
vehicles.
      (3)   Driveway connections crossing drainage swales must conform to
Greene County specifications complete with concrete headwalls as called for by
Sections 816 and 817 of the Greene County Subdivision Regulations, as amended. 
Should the driveway require a culvert, pipe or bridge, no zoning permit will be
issued until a recommendation is received from the Village of Yellow Springs
Public Works Department.  It is recommended that a pre-manufactured culvert,
pipe or bridge be used.  If a custom design is used, then it must be designed
by a professional engineer and approved by the Village of Yellow Springs Public
Works Department before construction.
   (b)   Outdoor Storage. Outdoor storage of merchandise, equipment, supplies,
products or other materials shall only be permitted in those districts and
under the conditions specifically authorized by this code. Storage of household
items in Residential Districts is permitted in the rear yard only and if not in
violation of other laws (nuisance, litter and trash).
   (c)   Recreational Vehicle Parking. It shall be unlawful for any person to
park or cause to be parked any mobile home or recreational vehicle on any
street, alley, highway, or other public place in the Village, except for the
expeditious loading and unloading of the vehicle. This provision shall not
prohibit the temporary occupancy for periods up to 72 hours of a recreational
vehicle; provided the recreational vehicle contains sleeping accommodations, is
parked on a lot in a Residential District, and is for the use of the owner of
that lot or guests of the owner.
   (d)   Storage and Repair of Vehicles.
      (1)   The repair, restoration and maintenance of vehicles in any
Residential District shall be conducted entirely within an enclosed building,
except for those activities that can be and are completed in less than seven
days. All such repair shall take place on private property and may not be
conducted within the public right-of-way.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for the owner, tenant or lessee of any lot or
building in a Residential District to permit the open storage or parking
outside of a building of semi-truck tractors and/or semi-truck trailers,
bulldozers, earth carriers, cranes or any other similar equipment or machinery,
unless parked for purposes of construction being conducted on that lot.
(Ord. 2019-38.  Passed 12-2-19.)
1260.04   USES.
   (a)   Accessory Buildings and Structures.
      (1)   Accessory buildings or garages shall be considered to be part of
the principal building and subject to all setback requirements of the principal
building, if structurally and architecturally integrated into the building or
if attached by an enclosed breezeway or similar enclosed structure not greater
than ten feet in length. Detached accessory buildings shall be located at least
ten feet from any principal building.
      (2)   Accessory buildings and structures shall not be erected in any
front yard.
      (3)   Accessory buildings and structures may be erected in a rear yard if
set back at least ten feet from the rear and five feet from the side property
lines.
      (4)   An accessory building or structure designed for and containing a
vehicle entrance to be accessed from an existing publicly dedicated and
commonly used alley may be located on the rear lot line, if parking space plans
have been approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   The height of an accessory structure shall not exceed 18 feet when
a hip or gable roof is used, 15 feet when a mansard or gambrel roof is used and
12 feet when a flat or shed roof is used, except when a dwelling unit is
included in the structure, in which case the height shall not exceed 24 feet. 
      (6)   Accessory structures shall not exceed 66% of the principal
building’s gross floor area or 800 square feet, whichever is less.
      (7)   An accessory building or accessory structure shall not be
constructed or occupied on a lot before the principal building or use on the
lot is constructed.
      (8)   Accessory buildings and structures in planned unit developments
shall be subject to the same requirements as in the Residential Districts.
      (9)   Accessory structures located in a designated flood hazard area
shall comply with the additional provisions set forth in
Chapter 1282.
      (10)   Swing sets, playground equipment, garden trellises, well-head
covers, portable or temporary pools less than 24 inches in depth, and similar
above- ground yard equipment accessory to a residential use shall be exempt
from the provisions of this zoning code, except for height limitations, or
unless specific provision is made for such equipment by Village ordinance.
      (11)   Buildings and structures accessory to nonresidential uses shall
meet the minimum setback requirements and height limitations for principal
buildings in the respective zoning district. 
      (12)   Accessory structures and buildings shall share all public
utilities (water/ sewer/electric) with the principal building. Accessory
structures and buildings will not be separately metered.
      (13)   Private swimming pools and spas. All private swimming pools and
spas shall be considered accessory structures and may be constructed in any
rear yard not closer than five feet from any property line or building,
excluding zoning districts Conservation and I-2 (Industrial) and must meet the
following criteria:
         A.   Every person owning land on which there is situated a swimming
pool or spa shall erect an adequate enclosure or fence surrounding either the
property or pool area, sufficient to make such body of water inaccessible to
small children.  Such enclosure or fence, including gates therein, shall not be
less than four feet above the outside underlying ground and shall be of a type
of construction which cannot be easily climbed by small children. All gates
shall be self-closing and self-latching with latches placed at least 42 inches
above the outside underlying ground or otherwise made inaccessible from the
outside to small children. A dwelling structure, garage or accessory building
of at least four feet in height may constitute a portion of such enclosure. A
natural barrier, hedge, removable ladder or other protective device may be used
so long as the degree of protection afforded by the substituted devices or
structures is not less than the protection afforded by the enclosure, fence,
gate, and latch described herein. 
         B.   A hot tub or spa secured by means of a rigid and locking cover
shall not require a fence.
         C.   Any lighting used to illuminate the pool shall be so arranged and
shaded as to reflect light away from adjoining properties and public streets.
         D.   All swimming pools and spas shall be maintained in good condition
so as to prevent the growth of organisms which constitute a health hazard and
to prevent the breeding of insects. 
   (b)   Essential Services. The installation and maintenance of essential
service equipment is exempt from this zoning code.
   (c)   Illegal Dwellings.  The use of any basement for dwelling purposes is
prohibited in any zoning district, unless the basement meets the appropriate
Village building codes.  Buildings erected as garages or accessory buildings
shall not be occupied for dwelling purposes, except in conformance with the
requirements of Section
1262.08(e)(1) for accessory dwellings.
   (d)   Principal Use per Lot. A lot or parcel shall not be devoted to more
than one principal use, or contain more than one principal building, except for
groups of multiple family dwellings, agricultural buildings, approved mixed use
developments, planned unit developments (PUDs), pocket neighborhood
developments (PNDs), or commercial or industrial buildings determined by the
Planning Commission to be a principal use collectively.
   (e)   Prohibited Uses.  Uses not specifically permitted by right or
conditional approval by this zoning code shall be prohibited.
   (f)   Uses in Conformance. No building, structure or land shall be used or
occupied, and no building, structure or part thereof shall be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged or structurally altered, unless in
conformity with the provisions of this code.
   (g)   Uses on a Lot.  Every building, structure or use erected or
established within the Village shall be located on a legally recorded lot or
parcel and shall conform to all applicable requirements of this code.
   (h)   Tiny Home.  A structure built on a permanent chassis with or without
wheels which must receive a certificate of occupancy from Greene County
Building Regulations in order to be used as a dwelling unit or accessory
dwelling unit on a single-family zoned lot.  Greene County Building Regulations
will only issue a certificate of occupancy with proof of the following:
      (1)   Built as a manufactured home, proof of certification with a HUD
seal is required.

CHAPTER 1262
Conditional Use Requirements
1262.01   Purpose.
1262.02   Procedures.
1262.03   General standards.
1262.04   Conditions of approval.
1262.05   Expiration.
1262.06   Revocation.
1262.07   Performance guarantees.
1262.08   Specific requirements.
1262.01   PURPOSE.
   Conditional uses are uses of land specifically permitted within a zoning
district only with the approval of the Planning Commission, following a review
of the use and its potential impact on its surroundings. These uses are
generally consistent with the purpose of the zoning district in which they are
permitted but, due to unique operational characteristics, may not be desirable
or compatible in all locations within the district.  Factors such as traffic,
hours of operation, noise, odor or similar potential nuisance effects require
that the conditional use be evaluated relative to its appropriateness on a
case-by-case basis.  This chapter establishes the review procedure for
conditional uses and the general standards that must be met for all conditional
uses. In addition, more specific requirements are established for certain
individual uses, as necessary, to mitigate their potential negative impacts.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1262.02   PROCEDURES.
   Applications for conditional uses shall be considered by the Planning
Commission in accordance with the following procedures:
   (a)   Application. An application for conditional use approval shall be made
to the Planning Commission in writing, on a form for that purpose, and shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator at least 20 days before the next regularly
scheduled meeting at which it is to be heard. The application must be
accompanied by a fee, as established by the Village Council, a site plan in
accordance with the requirements of
Chapter 1268 and such other material as the Commission determines necessary.
   (b)   Public Notice. When an application has been filed in proper form with
the required data, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall cause notice of
the time, place and purpose of the hearing to be given, in writing by first
class mail, to the applicant(s), to owners of property contiguous to and
directly across the street from the property that is the subject of the
conditional use application. The notice shall be given at least seven days in
advance of the hearing, noting the request and the property location. The name
and address of any property owner on the most recent property record of the
Greene County Auditor shall be the address used for public notification.  If
the address is unclear or uncertain, the property owner may be notified by
legal notice published one time at least seven days in advance of any hearing,
listing the address of the property to receive notification.
   (c)   Sign. At least ten days prior to the scheduled public hearing, a
temporary sign six square feet in area shall be posted on the property subject
to a conditional use request. The sign shall be removed within three days
following the public hearing at which the request was heard. The sign shall
contain the following information:
      (1)   The specific request being made;
      (2)   Date of the public hearing;
      (3)   Location of the public hearing; and
      (4)   Location where additional information may be obtained regarding the
request
   (d)   Representation. The applicant shall appear at the public hearing in
person or by agent. If the applicant or authorized representative is not
present, no action shall be taken by the Planning Commission on that
application.
   (e)   Record of Proceedings. The Planning Commission shall keep minutes of
its proceedings, showing the action of the Commission and the vote of each
member or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact. The Commission
shall act by resolution.
   (f)   Required Vote. The concurring vote of three Planning Commission
members shall be necessary to approve a conditional use application.
   (g)   Review Criteria. The Planning Commission shall review the application
in relation to the general standards of this chapter for conditional uses, as
provided in Section
1262.03, and any specific standards required for the use proposed, as
identified in this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13; Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 5-21-18.)
1262.03   GENERAL STANDARDS.
   Any request for a conditional use shall only be approved upon a finding that
each of the following general standards is satisfied, in addition to any
applicable requirements pertaining to the specific use:
   (a)   The proposed use will be consistent with the intent and purposes of
this zoning code and the vision, goals and recommendations of the Comprehensive
Plan and Vision:  Yellow Springs and Miami Township.

sewers, and schools. The applicant or landowner will be required to install
public utilities, streets or other public infrastructure as required by the
Village, State or other agencies to applicable specifications. Dedication of
said public infrastructure may be required. 
   (e)   The proposed use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment and conditions of operations, including, but not limited
to, hours of operation, that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare, odor or other characteristic not comparable to the uses permitted
in the zoning district.
   (f)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
   (g)   The proposed use will not block sight lines from the right-of-way to
existing signs or windows on the front or side of a building.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1262.04   CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
   Reasonable conditions may be imposed on the approval of a conditional land
use in order to achieve the following:
   (a)   Ensure public services and facilities affected by the proposed use or
activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads
necessitated by the proposed use.
   (b)   Ensure that the use is compatible with adjacent conforming land uses
and activities.
   (c)   Protect natural resources; the health, safety, and welfare; and the

1262.05   EXPIRATION.
   Approval of a conditional use shall expire 12 months after it is granted,
unless construction is complete or commencement of the use has begun. The
Planning Commission may, upon written request by the applicant, extend the term
of the conditional use approval by one additional period of up to 12 months,
upon a finding that there have been no changed conditions in the area which
would require reconsideration of the conditional use application or site plan.
A request for an extension of the initial permit period shall be submitted in
writing to the Zoning Administrator prior to the expiration of the initial
approval.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1262.06   REVOCATION.
   If a violation of any of the conditions or standards imposed on a
conditional land use is found to exist, the Zoning Administrator shall notify
the owner of the premises, the Planning Commission and the Village Manager that
a violation exists and that the permit will be revoked within 15 days of
notification. If the violation is not corrected within 15 days, the Village
Manager shall revoke the permit. Furthermore, the violation shall be declared
by the Village Manager to be a violation of the zoning code, subject to all of
the remedies and penalties provided for in this code.

      (5)   Sexually oriented business.
         A.   Intent.  In the development and execution of these zoning
regulations, it is recognized that some uses, because of their very nature, may
have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when
several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby causing a
deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. The proximity of sexually oriented
businesses to certain uses considered particularly susceptible to the negative
impacts of the concentration of sexually oriented uses tends to erode the
quality of life, adversely affect property values, disrupt business investment,
encourage residents and businesses to move or avoid the community, increase
crime, and contribute to a blighting effect on the surrounding area. There is
convincing documented evidence of the deleterious effect that sexually oriented
businesses have on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding
residential areas to which they may be adjacent.  Therefore, the following
intents are served by these regulations:
            1.   This subsection describes the uses regulated and the specific
standards necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of these uses will not
contribute to the deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood, to prevent
undesirable concentration of these uses, and to require sufficient spacing from
uses considered most susceptible to negative impacts.
            2.   These provisions are not intended, nor shall they have the
effect of, imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials including, but not limited to, sexually oriented
materials that are protected by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution. 
            3.   Additionally, it is not the intent of the provisions of this
section, nor shall it have the effect of, restricting or denying access by
adults to sexually oriented materials that are protected by said Federal and
State constitutions. 
            4.   Further, it is not the intent of these provisions, nor shall
they have the effect of, denying access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their target market. 
            5.   These regulations shall not be interpreted as intending to
legitimize any activities that are prohibited by Federal or State law, or by
any other code of the Village.
         B.   Uses regulated. The following uses are regulated by this
subsection and defined for purposes of regulating sexually oriented businesses:
            1.   Adult arcade.
            2.   Adult book store.
            3.   Adult cabaret, club, bar or lounge.
            4.   Adult motel.
            5.   Adult motion picture theater.
         C.   Regulations.
            1.   No sexually oriented business shall be permitted in a location
in which any principal building or accessory structure, including signs, is
within 1,320 feet of any principal building or accessory structure of another
sexually oriented business.
            2.   No sexually oriented business shall be established on a parcel
within 500 feet of any parcel in a residential district or any parcel used for
a single-family, two-family or multiple-family residence, public park, school,
child care facility, church or similar place of worship, public library,
Village office, police department or fire department, youth center, or
commercially operated school attended by children such as, for example, dance
schools, gymnastic centers, etc. The distance between a proposed sexually
oriented business and any such zoned area or existing use shall be measured in
a straight line from the nearest property line upon which the proposed sexually
oriented business is to be located to the nearest property line of that zoned
area or existing use.
            3.   Any sign or advertising for the sexually oriented business
must comply with the provisions of this code. No sign or advertising may
include photographs, silhouettes, or drawings of any specified anatomical areas
or specified sexual activities, or obscene representations of the human form
and may not include animated or flashing illumination.
            4.   The entrances to the proposed sexually oriented business at
both the exterior and interior walls, in a location visible to those entering
and exiting the business, must be clearly marked with lettering at least two
inches in height stating:
               a.   "Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to enter the
premises;" and
               b.   "No alcoholic beverages of any type are permitted within
the premises."
            5.   No product or service for sale or gift, or any picture or
other representation of any product or service for sale or gift, shall be
displayed so as to be visible by a person of normal visual acuity from the
nearest adjoining roadway or a neighboring property.
            6.   Hours of operation shall be limited to 9:00 a.m. to 11:00
p.m., Monday through Saturday.
            7.   All off street and on-site parking areas shall comply with
this code, based on the primary use (i.e., retail, assembly, etc.) and shall
additionally be illuminated at all times.
            8.   Any booth, room or cubical available in any sexually oriented
business that is used by patrons for the viewing of any entertainment shall:
               a.   Be unobstructed by any door, lock or other entrance and
exit control device;
               b.   Have at least one side totally open to a public, lighted
aisle so that there is an unobstructed view at all times from the adjoining
aisle of any occupant;
               c.   Be illuminated such that a person of normal visual acuity
looking into the booth, room or cubical from its entrance adjoining the public
lighted aisle can clearly determine the number of people within;
               d.   Have no holes or openings in any side or rear wall not
relating to utility, ventilation or temperature control services or otherwise
required by any governmental code or authority.
         D.   Conditions of approval. Prior to granting approval for the
establishment of any sexually oriented business, the Planning Commission may
impose any conditions or limitations upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance, or operation of the sexually oriented business which
is necessary for the protection of the public interest. Any evidence, bond, or
other performance guarantee may be required as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith will be fulfilled.
         E.   Access to minors. No person operating a sexually oriented
business shall permit any person under the age of 18 to be on the premises of
the business as an employee, customer, or otherwise.

accessory, incidental and subordinate to the permitted principal residential
use, and shall not utilize more than 20% of the usable floor area of the
principal dwelling or its equivalent if conducted within an accessory building,
or 250 square feet , whichever is less.
         F.   The appearance of the dwelling shall not be altered, nor shall
the occupation within the dwelling be conducted in any manner that would cause
the premises to differ from its residential character either by the use of
colors, materials, construction, lighting or the emission of sounds, vibrations
or light that carry beyond the premises.
         G.   No outdoor storage, activities or displays shall be permitted.
         H.   No combustible, toxic or hazardous materials may be used or

            7.   On a lot to be used for a PND, an existing single-family
dwelling or duplex structure, which may be nonconforming with respect to the
standards of this section, shall be permitted to remain, but the extent of the
nonconformity may not be increased, and the existing structure will factor into
the maximum lot coverage permitted for that residential zoning district.  An
existing single-family dwelling or duplex structure will only count as one
dwelling unit towards the minimum of four dwelling units as noted in subsection
B.6. An existing accessory dwelling unit (ADU) will not be allowed in a PND. An
existing ADU may be converted to another use such as a storage building, HOA
community room or HOA guest housing.

located.
         J.   Other PND standards.
            1.    PNDs are limited to detached single family dwelling units in
R-A, Low Density Residential. In R-B, Moderate Density Residential and R-C,
High Density Residential, up to fifty percent can be either two-family
dwellings and/or single-family attached.
            2.   Privately-held accessory structures and accessory dwelling
units are not allowed.
            3.   A PND shall be located on one lot with all common open space
under the control of a Homeowner's Association (HOA).  A draft of the
conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs) shall be provided to the
Planning Commission during the Level B site plan review meeting, with final
approval of the CC&R by staff.  Once approved, the CC&Rs shall be recorded with
Greene County.  The CC&Rs must create a homeowner's association that will
provide for maintenance of all common areas in the PND which includes but are
not limited to areas of common open space, parking, roadways, street right-of-
ways, exterior setbacks, driveways, required yards, utility easements,
pedestrian paths, and shared community buildings or shared accessory
structures.
            4.   The dwelling units may be individually owned or rented with no
more than fifty percent rentals.
            5.   Prior to the Planning Commission conditional use hearing, a
preliminary meeting with utilities and planning staff to review the project
must be held.  A Level B site plan review, including a storm water plan as
specified in 1226.06 Design Standards is required for approval of the PND
conditional use. Prior to submittal to the Planning Commission, the Level B
site plan shall be reviewed by a designated Village of Yellow Springs engineer,
who will provide a written report of findings for the Planning Commission.  The
engineer may be present at the conditional use hearing to answer questions
related to their findings.
            6.   Pedestrian pathways must be included to provide for movement
of residents and guests from parking areas to homes and other amenities.  These
pathways must be shown on the site plan and be part of the common areas/tracts.

submit to the Zoning Administrator, a transient guest lodging application with
the applicable fee. This application includes the contact information for the
owner and if applicable, the property manager who can be contacted and will
respond within a reasonable time period to any complaints, violations,
emergencies or other concerns related to the transient guest lodging property
or tenants.
         B.   Location. The Planning Commission shall consider the proposed
location relative to its proximity to other such uses in the vicinity in order
to avoid an undue concentration that could have a negative effect on the
surrounding neighborhood. A transient guest lodging unit may be located in a
dwelling unit, a room or rooms in a dwelling unit, or an accessory dwelling
unit.
         C.   Maximum occupancy. The maximum number of tenants permitted shall
be determined by applicable Health Department requirements. If the transient
guest lodging is located in an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) no more than two
adults shall occupy the accessory dwelling unit.
         D.   Utilities. The transient guest lodging unit shall share all
public utilities (water/sewer/electric) with the principal dwelling unit.
Transient guest lodging units will not be separately metered.
         E.   Parking. A minimum of one off-street parking space shall be
provided on the lot for the transient guest lodging unit in addition to the
off-street parking spaces required for the principal dwelling unit.
         F.   Ingress/egress. No new access points or driveways shall be
created or installed for access to the transient guest lodging unit.
         G.   Transient guest lodging applications are non-transferable. A
change in the ownership of the property or if the application was submitted

verification from a professional engineer licensed in the State of Ohio that
the antenna(s) planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on any
existing or approved towers or other structures within a two-mile radius of the
proposed tower location due to one or more of the following reasons:
            1.   Existing public site. There are no existing publicly- owned
towers or sites suitable to accommodate the proposed tower or antennas.
            2.   Inadequate structural capacity. The antenna(s) would exceed
the structural capacity of an existing or approved tower or other structure.
            3.   Interference. The antennas would cause interference impacting

CHAPTER 1264
Off-Street Parking and Loading
1264.01   Purpose.
1264.02   General requirements.
1264.03   Off-street parking and facility design.
1264.04   Off-street loading requirements.
1264.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe regulations for off-street
parking of motor vehicles in residential and nonresidential zoning districts;
to ensure by the provision of these regulations that adequate parking and
access is provided in a safe and convenient manner; and to afford reasonable
protection to adjacent land uses from light, noise, air pollution and other
affects of parking areas.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1264.02   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Applicability of Parking Requirements.  For all buildings and uses
established after the effective date of this code, off-street parking shall be
provided as required by this chapter. 
      (1)   Whenever use of a building or lot is changed to another
classification of use, off-street parking facilities shall be provided, as
required by this chapter. 
      (2)   If the intensity of use of any building or lot is increased,
through the addition of floor area, increase in seating capacity, number of
employees or other means, additional off-street parking shall be provided, as
required by this chapter.
      (3)   Off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of
this code shall not be reduced below the requirements of this chapter, nor
shall nonconforming parking facilities that exist as of the effective date of
this code be further reduced or made more nonconforming. 
      (4)   An area designated as required off-street parking shall not be
changed to another use, unless equal facilities are provided elsewhere in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Location.  Off-street parking facilities required for all uses other
than single and two-family dwellings shall be located on the lot or within 300
feet of the building(s) or use they are intended to serve, as measured along
lines of public access from the nearest point of the parking facility to the
building(s) or use served. Off-street parking facilities required for single-
and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as
the building they are intended to serve, and shall consist of a parking strip,
parking apron, and/or garage. All residential driveways shall meet Village
engineering standards. In the B-1, Central Business District, parking
facilities shall be located within 600 feet of the building or use to be
served.
   (c)   Shared/Common Parking.
      (1)   Two or more buildings or uses may share a common parking facility,
provided the number of parking spaces available equals the required number of
spaces for all the uses computed separately.  Cumulative parking requirements
for mixed-use developments or shared facilities may be reduced by the Planning
Commission where it can be determined that one or more of the factors listed in
subsection (d) below apply.
      (2)   Parking facilities for a church or place of worship may be used to
meet not more than 50% of the off-street parking for theaters, stadiums and
other places of public assembly, stores, office buildings and industrial
establishments lying within 600 feet of a church or place of worship, as
measured along lines of public access; provided, the church or place of worship
makes the spaces available and there is no conflict between times when the uses
are in need of the parking facilities.
   (d)   Modification of Parking Requirements.  The Planning Commission may
reduce the parking space requirements of this chapter for any use, based upon a
finding that other forms of travel are available and likely to be used and, in
particular, the site design will incorporate both bicycle parking facilities
and pedestrian connections.  In addition, one or more of the following
conditions shall also be met:
      (1)   Shared parking by multiple uses where there will be a high
proportion of multi-purpose visits or where uses have peak parking demands
during differing times of the day or days of the week and meeting the following
requirements:
         A.   Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between the uses.
         B.   For separate lots, shared parking areas shall be adjacent to each
other, with pedestrian and vehicular connections maintained between the lots.
         C.   Unless the multiple uses all are within a unified business
center, office park or industrial park all under the same ownership, shared
parking agreements shall be filed with the Clerk of Council after approval by
the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Convenient municipal off-street parking or on-street spaces are
located adjacent to the subject property.
      (3)   Expectation of walk-in trade is reasonable due to sidewalk
connections to adjacent residential neighborhoods or employment centers. To
allow for a parking space reduction, the site design shall incorporate
pedestrian connections to the site and on-site pedestrian circulation,
providing safe and convenient access to the building entrance.
      (4)   Where the applicant has provided a parking study, conducted by a
qualified traffic engineer, demonstrating that another standard would be more
appropriate based on actual number of employees, expected level of customer
traffic, or actual counts at a similar establishment.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may require a parking study to document
that any one or more of the criteria in subsections (d)(1) through (4) above
would be met.
   (e)   Deferred Parking.
      (1)   Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not warranted,
but an applicant demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use
would be excessive, the Planning Commission may defer some of the required
parking. A site plan shall designate portions of the site for future
construction of the required parking spaces, meeting the design and dimensional
requirements of this chapter.  Any area so designated shall be maintained in a
landscaped appearance and not occupy required buffers, greenbelts or parking
lot setbacks, or be used for any other purpose.  Landscaping, such as parking
lot trees, that would otherwise be required for the deferred spaces shall be
installed within the deferred parking area.
      (2)   The deferred parking shall meet the requirements of this chapter,
if constructed. Construction of the additional parking spaces within the
deferred parking area may be initiated by the owner or required by the Village,
based on parking needs or observation, and shall require approval of an amended
site plan.
   (f)   Temporary Parking. It is recognized that there may be special events
or situations that occur infrequently which would result in a temporary
reduction in the availability of required parking spaces or create a need for
temporary off-site parking. Such events could include outdoor vehicle sales,
festivals, fairs, church/school car washes or garage sales. In those instances,
the Zoning Administrator may authorize the temporary use of the required
parking area or temporary off-site parking upon a demonstration by the
applicant that:
      (1)   The loss of the required parking spaces may be offset by requiring
employees or customers to park elsewhere or that due to the time of year or
nature of the on-site business, the required spaces are not needed;
      (2)   Permission has been granted by neighboring property owners or
operators to use their parking facilities;
      (3)   The duration of the special event is so short or of such a nature
as to not create any parking problems for the normal operation of the existing
on-site use;
      (4)   Temporary off-site parking is located and designed to ensure safe
and efficient circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles  (a site plan may
be required to demonstrate this);
      (5)   The proposed special event satisfies all other applicable Village
regulations.
   (g)   Maximum Allowed Parking. In order to minimize excessive areas of
pavement that detract from aesthetics, contribute to high rates of storm water
runoff and generate reflective heat, the minimum parking space requirements of
this section shall not be exceeded by more than 10%, unless approved by the
Planning Commission as part of site plan review. In approving additional
parking space, the Planning Commission shall determine that the parking is
necessary, based on documented evidence, to accommodate the use on a typical
day.
   (h)   Downtown Parking.  The minimum off-street parking spaces required for
any nonresidential use in the B-1 District shall be reduced by 25% from the
requirements of
Table 1264.02.  These requirements may be further reduced by the Planning
Commission in conformance with the provisions of Section
1264.02(d).
   (i)   Bicycle Parking. Accommodation for bicycle parking is encouraged in
all districts, but especially in the B-1, Central Business District, and the E-
I, Educational Institution District.
   (j)   Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. The minimum number of required
off-street parking spaces shall be provided and maintained on the premises or
as otherwise allowed by this chapter, on the basis of the applicable
requirements of
Table 1264.02. As a condition of approval, the Village Council may require that
a performance guarantee be posted, in accordance with the provisions of Section
1272.04.
      (1)   When units or measurements determining the number of required
parking spaces result in a fraction over one-half, a full parking space shall
be required.
      (2)   In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirement
for off-street parking facilities for a specified use which is most similar, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, shall apply.
      (3)   Each 24 inches of bench, pew, or similar seating facilities shall
be counted as one seat, except if specifications and plans filed in conjunction
with a building permit application specify a maximum seating capacity, that
number may be used as the basis for required parking spaces.
      (4)   Where parking requirements are based upon maximum seating or
occupancy capacity, the capacity shall be as determined by the Building Code
and Fire Code.
      (5)   Unless otherwise indicated, floor area shall be usable floor area
(UFA).

   (a)   Location and Setbacks. Off-street parking lots shall meet the setback
requirements applicable to parking, as specified in the zoning district or
requirements which may be specified for individual uses.
   (b)   Parking Construction and Development. The construction of any parking
lot shall require approval of a site plan, in accordance with
Chapter 1268.  Construction shall be completed and approved by the Zoning
Administrator before a certificate of occupancy is issued and the parking lot
is used.
      (1)   Pavement. All parking lots and vehicle and equipment storage areas
shall be paved with an asphalt or concrete binder, and shall be graded and
drained so as to dispose of surface water which might accumulate. The Planning
Commission may approve alternative paving materials, such as permeable/grass
pavers, for all or a portion of the parking areas, based upon credible evidence
of the durability and appearance of the proposed materials. For storage areas,
the Planning Commission may approve a substitute for hard-surfaced pavement
upon a determination that there are no adverse effects on adjoining properties.
      (2)   Drainage. Surface water from parking areas shall be managed in
accordance with the Village engineering standards. The Village Manager shall,
in consultation with the Village Engineer, determine the appropriate detention
treatment. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs associated with the
Village Engineer's review.
      (3)   Dimensions. Parking space and aisle dimensions shall meet the
applicable requirements specified in
Table 1264.03.
         A.   Angled parking between these ranges shall be to the nearest
degree.
         B.   Space length may be reduced by up to two feet if an unobstructed
overhang, such as a landscaped area or sidewalk, is provided. A sidewalk shall
have a minimum width of seven feet where abutting a parking area. There shall
be a minimum distance of seven feet between the parking lot curb and building.
Where curbing does not exist, bumper blocks shall be provided to protect
pedestrian space adjacent to the building.
         C.   All parking lots shall be striped and maintained showing
individual parking bays, in accordance with the following dimensions:

      (4)   Stacking spaces. Waiting/stacking spaces for drive-through uses
(such as banks, restaurants, car washes, pharmacies, dry cleaners and oil
change establishments) shall be at least 24 feet long and ten feet wide.
Stacking spaces shall not block required off-street parking spaces. Where the
drive-through waiting lane provides for a single lane for five or more
vehicles, an escape/by-pass lane shall be provided to allow vehicles to exit
the waiting lane.
      (5)   Ingress and egress.  Adequate vehicular ingress and egress to the
parking area shall be provided by means of clearly limited and defined drives.
All parking lots shall provide interior access and circulation aisles for all
parking spaces. The use of public streets for maneuvering into or out of off-
street parking spaces shall be prohibited. Ingress and egress to a parking lot
in a nonresidential zoning district shall not be through a residential
district, except in instances where access is provided by means of an alley
that forms the boundary between a residential and nonresidential district.
Except in the B-1 District (downtown), access to nonresidential parking lots
shall meet the following standards:
         A.   Ingress and egress driveways shall be located no closer than 50
feet to the intersecting right-of-way of two streets and no closer than three
feet to any adjoining property line.
         B.   Driveways shall not exceed 30 feet in width, as measured at the
right-of-way line.
         C.   A maximum of one driveway shall be permitted per street frontage;
provided a second driveway may be allowed where the frontage exceeds 200 feet.
         D.   No driveway shall be closer than 75 feet to another driveway on
the same or abutting property.
         E.   Driveways shall be perpendicular or no more than 30 degrees from
perpendicular to the curb.
         F.   Driveways shall not be located closer than 25 feet to any
property line, unless approved as a shared driveway for two or more properties.
         G.   All driveways shall be constructed in accordance with the Village
engineering standards.
      (6)   Curbing. A six-inch concrete curb, or alternative as determined by
the Planning Commission, shall be provided around all sides of any parking lot
of five or more spaces to protect landscaped areas, sidewalks, buildings, or
adjacent property from vehicles that might otherwise extend beyond the edge of
the parking lot. Curb openings are allowed for storm water drainage, as
recommended by the Village Engineer. Plantings shall be set back two feet from
curbs to allow for bumper overhang.
      (7)   Landscaping. Off-street parking areas shall be landscaped and/or
buffered, in accordance with the requirements of
Chapter 1270.
      (8)   Lighting. Light fixtures used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall be arranged to deflect the light away from adjoining properties and
adjacent streets. Lighting fixtures in parking areas adjacent to any
residentially zoned or used property shall not exceed 20 feet in height.
Fixtures in all other parking areas shall not exceed 35 feet in height. Light
fixtures shall be designed to achieve 90 degree luminary cutoff.
      (9)   Fire lanes. Fire lanes shall be designated on the site and posted
with signage prior to occupancy.  Vehicle circulation shall meet turning radius
requirements set by the Fire Department.
   (c)   Barrier Free Parking in Parking Lots.  Within each parking lot, signed
and marked barrier free spaces shall be provided at a convenient location, in
accordance with the Barrier Free Parking Space Requirements of the Ohio
Department of Transportation. Barrier free spaces shall be located as close as
possible to building entrances. Where a curb exists between a parking lot
surface and a sidewalk entrance, an inclined approach or curb cut with a
gradient of not more than a 1:12 slope and width of a minimum four feet shall
be provided for wheelchair access.
   (d)   Maintenance.  All parking areas shall be maintained free of trash and
debris.  Surface, curbing, light fixtures and signage shall be maintained in
good condition.
   (e)   Limitations on Use of Parking Lots.
      (1)   Off-street parking areas are intended only for temporary vehicle
parking for public safety. Except when land is used as storage space in
connection with the business of a repair or service garage, use of parking
areas or open land is not permitted for the storage or parking of wrecked or
junked cars, or for creating a junk yard or nuisance.
      (2)   Loading spaces, as required in Section
1264.04, and parking spaces, required in Section
1264.02, shall be considered separate and distinct requirements and shall be
provided as individual components on the site.  In no case shall one component
be construed as meeting the requirements of the other.
      (3)   Parking lots and loading areas shall not be used for the long-term
storage of trucks or trailers, except where such outdoor storage is
specifically permitted in the industrial district. Overnight parking or storage
of commercial vehicles shall be prohibited, except for uses and locations
approved for vehicle storage. This shall not be construed to prohibit the
parking overnight of commercial fleet vehicles or the short-term parking of
trailers in loading bays or staging areas in Business or Industrial Districts.
      (4)   It shall be unlawful to use a parking lot or open area to store or
park any vehicle for the purpose of displaying vehicles for sale, except in an
approved vehicle sales dealership.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1264.04   OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Uses Requiring Loading Area. On the same premises with every building,
structure or part thereof, erected and occupied for manufacturing, storage,
warehouse, retails sales, consumer services or other uses similarly involving
the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials or merchandise, there shall
be provided and maintained on the lot adequate space for standing, loading and

CHAPTER 1266
Signs
1266.01   Purpose.
1266.02   General provisions.
1266.03   Permitted signs.
1266.04   Prohibited signs.
1266.05   Signs not requiring permits.
1266.06   Nonconforming signs.
1266.07   Sign permits.
1266.08   Application procedure/fees.
1266.09   Inspection and maintenance.
1266.01   PURPOSE.
   The regulations of this chapter are intended to protect and further the
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Village; to maintain and
improve the appearance of the community; to conserve community character; to
prevent traffic hazards; to provide safe conditions for pedestrians; and to
promote economic development by regulating the construction, alteration,
repair, maintenance, size, location and number of signs. It is further
determined that to allow signs of excessive number and size in the Village
would unduly distract pedestrians and motorists, create traffic hazards and
reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. The regulations
of this chapter are intended to provide reasonable identification for
businesses and other uses within the community; but are not intended to serve
as a means of advertising.
(Ord. 2016-11.  Passed 6-20-16.)
1266.02   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The following regulations are applicable to all signs in all zoning
districts.
   (a)   Sign Structure and Placement.
      (1)   Signs shall be constructed to withstand all wind and vibration
forces which can normally be expected to occur.
      (2)   Signs shall not be placed in, upon or over any public right-of-way,
alley, or other place, except as may be otherwise permitted by the Village
Manager or Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).
      (3)   A light pole, utility pole, tree, fence or other supporting member
shall not be used for the placement of any sign, except as may be specifically
permitted by this chapter.
      (4)   A sign shall not be erected in any location where it may, by reason
of its position, shape, color, lighting or other characteristics, interfere
with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic sign,
signal, or device, or constitute a nuisance per se.
      (5)   No sign shall be placed in a manner as to obstruct any fire escape,
any required exit, door or window or any ventilation system or other
operational necessities of a building.
      (6)   A sign attached to a building shall not be placed in any location
that would cause significant architectural features of a building to be
covered, hidden or obscured.
      (7)   A wall sign shall not extend past the edge of the wall to which it
is affixed and no wall sign shall extend above the roof line of a building.
      (8)   A sign and its supporting mechanism shall not extend beyond any lot
lines of the property on which it is located.
      (9)   All signs shall be stationary and shall pertain only to the
business or activity conducted on the premises, except for permitted community
special event signs.
      (10)   One changeable message display may be permitted on either a
permitted free-standing or ground sign, or wall sign on a parcel, within the
maximum size limits permitted for the sign; provided the message is static and
is not changed more than once in any twelve-hour period.
      (11)   Any vehicle which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, has
the intended function of serving as a sign shall conform to the provisions of
Section
1266.04(f).
   (b)   Measurement of Sign Area.  No sign shall exceed the maximum sign area
allowed for the district in which it is located. The sign area is to be
expressed in square feet, computed to the nearest tenth of a square foot, and
shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Area. The area of a sign shall be measured as the area within a
single, continuous perimeter composed of any straight line geometric figure
which encloses the extreme limits of writing, representation, emblem, logo or
any other figure of similar character, together with any frame or other
material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed,
excluding only the structure necessary to support the sign.
      (2)   Double-faced sign. The area of a ground or projecting sign that has
two or more faces shall be measured by including the area of all sign faces,
except if two faces are placed back-to-back and are no more than two feet apart
at any point, the area of one face shall be counted toward the maximum size
requirement.  If the two back-to-back faces are of unequal size, the larger of
the two sign faces shall be counted as the one face.
      (3)   Wall sign.  For a sign consisting of individual letters and/or a
logo affixed directly onto a building, the area of the sign shall be computed
by measuring the area of the envelope required to enclose the lettering and
logo.
      (4)   Height. The height of a sign shall be measured as the vertical
distance from the highest point of the sign to the finished grade of the ground
immediately beneath the sign, excluding any artificially constructed earthen
berms.
      (5)   Multi-tenant buildings.  For buildings with multiple tenants, the
sign area for wall, projecting, canopy or awning signs shall be determined by
taking that portion of the front wall of the building applicable to each tenant
and computing the sign requirements for that portion of the total wall.
   (c)   Illumination and Movement.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided, signs shall not be illuminated
internally.  The source of the light for externally illuminated signs shall be
enclosed and directed to prevent light from shining directly onto traffic or
neighboring property and shall be directed in a downward manner to prevent
light pollution into the night sky.
      (2)   A sign shall not contain any moving or animated parts including
lighting, nor have the appearance of having moving or animated parts, except
for time and temperature signs, standard-sized barber pole signs, scoreboards
and gasoline price signs as otherwise permitted.
      (3)   Internally illuminated signs shall only be permitted within the B-
1 and B-2 Districts, but not within 50 feet of a Residential District unless
the sign is not visible from adjacent property within the Residential District.
(Ord. 2016-11.  Passed 6-20-16.)
1266.03   PERMITTED SIGNS.
   The following signs are permitted in combination, unless noted otherwise, in
each district, subject to the requirements described below and in Table 1266.03
(a) and (b), issuance of a sign permit and all other applicable regulations. 
In any B or I district, a maximum of three types of permitted signs and four
total permitted signs per principal building shall be allowed. In the case of a
multi-tenant building where the maximum number of permitted signs has been
reached, one additional sign per tenant shall be permitted. The Zoning
Administrator may exempt the maximum requirement if a site visit determines the
location of the signs will not be visible from the street or public property.

(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1268.06   REVIEW STANDARDS.
   A site plan shall be approved only upon a finding of compliance with the
following standards:
   (a)   The site plan must comply with all standards of this chapter and all
applicable requirements of this code and all other applicable laws and
regulations.
   (b)   The site must be designed in a manner that is harmonious, to the
greatest extent possible, with the character of the surrounding area.
   (c)   The site must be designed so as to minimize hazards to adjacent
property, and to reduce the negative effects of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes
and glare to the maximum extent possible.
   (d)   Unless a more specific design standard is required by the Village
through a different code, all uses and structures subject to site plan review
shall comply with the following design standards:
      (1)   Traffic circulation. The number, location, size of access and entry
points, and internal vehicular and pedestrian circulation routes shall be
designed to promote safe and efficient access to and from the site, and
circulation within the site. In reviewing traffic features, the number,
spacing, and alignment of existing and proposed access points shall be
considered relative to their impact on traffic movement on abutting streets and
adjacent properties.
      (2)   Storm water. Storm water detention and drainage systems shall be
designed so that the removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or public storm water drainage systems. Unless
impractical, storm water shall be removed from all roofs, canopies and paved
areas by underground surface drainage system. Low-impact design solutions,
however, such as rain gardens and green roofs, are encouraged.
      (3)   Landscaping. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state,
insofar as practicable, by minimizing unnecessary tree and soil removal, and
any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of
neighboring developed areas. Provision or preservation of landscaping, buffers
or greenbelts may be required to ensure that the proposed uses will be
adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding property.  Topsoil
shall be left intact or stored on site, using best management practices, for
site restoration upon completion of the project.
      (4)   Screening. Where nonresidential uses abut residential uses,
appropriate screening shall be provided, in accordance with
Chapter 1270, so as to shield residential properties from noise, headlights,
lighting and glare.
      (5)   Lighting. Lighting shall be designed to minimize glare on adjacent
properties and public streets. As a condition of site plan approval, reduction
of lighting during non-business hours may be required.
      (6)   Utility service. All utility service shall be underground, unless
impractical.
      (7)   Exterior uses. Exposed storage areas, machinery, heating and
cooling units, service areas, loading areas, utility buildings and structures,
and similar accessory areas shall be located to have a minimum negative effect
on adjacent properties, and shall be visually and acoustically screened, if
reasonably necessary, to ensure  compatibility with surrounding properties.
      (8)   Emergency access. All buildings and structures, including any Fire
Department, connections shall be readily accessible to emergency vehicles.
      (9)   Water and sewer. Water and sewer installations shall comply with
all Village specifications and requirements.
      (10)   Signs. Permitted signs shall be allowed, in accordance with
Chapter 1266, and shall be located to avoid creating distractions, visual
clutter and obstructions for traffic entering or exiting a site.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1268.07   CONDITIONS.
   Conditions which are designed to ensure compliance with the intent of this
code and other regulations of the Village may be imposed on site plan approval.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1268.08   CHANGES TO AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   Changes to an approved site plan shall be permitted only under the following
circumstances:
   (a)   The holder of an approved site plan shall notify the Zoning
Administrator of any proposed change to an approved site plan.
   (b)   Changes to a Level A site plan may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
   (c)   Minor changes to a Level B site plan may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator upon determining that the proposed revision(s) will not alter the
basic design or any specified conditions imposed as part of the original
approval. Minor changes shall include the following:
      (1)   Reduction in building size or increase in building size up to 5% of
total approved floor area.
      (2)   Movement of buildings or other structures by no more than ten feet.
      (3)   Replacement of plant material specified in the landscape plan with
comparable materials of an equal or greater size.
      (4)   Changes in building materials to a comparable or higher quality.
      (5)   Changes in floor plans which do not alter the character of the use.
      (6)   Changes required or requested by the Village or County, State, or
Federal regulatory agency in order to conform to other laws or regulations.
   (d)   A proposed change to a Level B site plan, not determined by the Zoning
Administrator to be a minor change, shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission as a site plan amendment, and shall be reviewed in the same manner
as the original application.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1268.09   EXPIRATION.
   Site plan approval shall expire 12 months after the date of approval, unless
substantial construction has been commenced and is continuing. The Zoning
Administrator, in the case of a Level A site plan, or the Planning Commission,
in the case of a Level B site plan, may grant one extension of up to 12
additional months; provided the applicant requests, in writing, an extension
prior to the date of expiration of the site plan. The extension shall be
approved if the applicant presents reasonable evidence to the effect that the
development has encountered unforeseen difficulties beyond the control of the
applicant, and the project will proceed within the extension period. If the
above provisions are not fulfilled or the extension has expired prior to
construction, the site plan approval shall become null and void.

CHAPTER 1270
Landscaping
1270.01   Purpose.
1270.02   Greenbelts and parking lot landscaping.
1270.03   General requirements.
1270.01   PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to require landscaping to minimize the
adverse effects of certain outdoor activities upon their surroundings and to
improve the appearance of parking areas and street frontages within the
community. It is further intended to preserve and enhance the aesthetic
qualities, character, privacy, and land values of property within the Village.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1270.02   GREENBELTS AND PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Greenbelts Required. Greenbelts and landscaping shall be required in
the following situations, except for parking areas within the B-1, Central
Business District.
      (1)   Along the street frontage, between the right-of-way line and the
parking lot of any parking lot containing four or more spaces;
      (2)   Within any required parking setback area; and
      (3)   Within the interior of any parking lot containing ten spaces or
more.
   (b)   Greenbelt Standards for Front Setbacks.  Greenbelts shall meet the
requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   At a minimum, a required greenbelt shall contain one canopy tree,
plus two additional canopy or understory trees for each 50 feet of road
frontage.
      (2)   Trees within a required greenbelt may be clustered to create more
visual impact and appeal, rather than uniformly spaced along the street.
      (3)   The minimum width of a required greenbelt shall correspond to the
parking setback requirements prescribed for the district, but shall not be less
than ten feet.
      (4)   Landscaping shall be located so it does not obstruct the vision of
drivers entering or leaving a site.
      (5)   Storm water detention/retention areas shall be permitted within
required greenbelts; provided, they shall not hamper the screening intent of
the greenbelt or jeopardize the survival of plants.
   (c)   Parking Lot Landscaping.  Where landscaping is required within parking
lots, it shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   One tree for every ten parking spaces shall be planted within the
parking lot. Trees shall be canopy species.  While drought tolerant native
species are preferred, other species may be planted within parking areas if
approved by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission, as applicable.
      (2)   Parking lots shall contain landscape islands. Each island shall be
a minimum of ten feet wide, although islands may be combined to ensure a better
environment for tree and plant growth.  Each island shall be planted with a
minimum of two trees to provide shade and to break up the visual monotony of
large paved parking lots.  Trees shall be planted at least three feet from the
edge of the island to avoid contact with vehicles.
      (3)   Landscaping shall be arranged so as not to obscure traffic signs or
fire hydrants, or obstruct drivers' sight distance within the parking area and
at driveway entrances.
      (4)   All landscape areas shall be protected by raised curbs, parking
blocks or other similar methods to prevent damage. Notwithstanding this
requirement, alternative low-impact design solutions shall be encouraged.
      (5)   Landscaping required for front yards which abut parking areas may
apply toward up to 50% of the required parking lot landscaping.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1270.03   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All required landscaping and greenbelts shall comply with the following
requirements, in addition to all other applicable requirements of this chapter:
   (a)   Minimum Plant Material Standards.
      (1)   All plant materials shall be hardy, free of disease and insects,
and indigenous to Greene County.
      (2)   Artificial plant material shall not be used within any required
landscaped area. This shall not preclude the use of stone, shredded bark, wood
chips, lava rock or similar accent materials within planting beds.
      (3)   All plant material shall be installed in a manner that does not
alter drainage patterns on site or adjacent properties, or obstruct vision for
safety of ingress or egress.
      (4)   No substitution of plant species or sizes shall be allowed unless
approved by the Zoning Administrator in writing.
      (5)   All plant material shall be planted in a manner that will not cause
damage to utility lines (above- and below-ground) and public roadways.
      (6)   Existing plant material which complies with the standards and
intent of this chapter may be credited toward meeting the landscape
requirements.
      (7)   The overall landscape plan shall not contain more than 33% of any
one plant species.
      (8)   Plant material shall not be placed closer than four feet to any
fence or property line.
      (9)   Where trees are placed in two or more rows, planting shall be
staggered in rows.
   (b)   Minimum Standards for Berms.
      (1)   If  berms are constructed, they shall be constructed to maintain a
side slope not to exceed a one- foot rise to a three-foot run ratio. When
topography or other site conditions prevent construction of berms at this
ratio, retaining walls or terracing may be permitted. If a berm is constructed
with a retaining wall or by terracing, the earthen slope shall face the
exterior of the site.
      (2)   Bermed areas not containing planting beds shall be covered with
grass or other living ground cover maintained in a healthy condition.
      (3)   Berms shall be constructed so drainage patterns on site or toward
adjacent properties will not be altered and vision will not be obstructed for
safety of ingress and egress.
      (4)   If berms are used for any part of a screen or greenbelt, all
required plant material shall be placed on the top and side slope facing the
exterior property line.
   (c)   Rain Gardens. Rain gardens are encouraged as part of a site
development and may be approved within a required greenbelt.  If provided, rain
gardens shall be prepared according to the following guidelines:
      (1)   The purpose of the rain garden is to absorb rain water and to
improve the attractiveness of the site.
      (2)   The size of the rain garden shall be appropriate for the soils
located on the site.
      (3)   Soils used in the rain garden shall be appropriately prepared and
amended following any compaction that may have occurred during construction.
      (4)   The rain garden shall be graded to assure that rain water entering
the garden will spread out over a large flat area and will soak into the soil.
      (5)   To minimize hazards to pedestrians, the rain garden shall be graded
so that at its deepest it is approximately six inches.
      (6)   The rain garden is planted with native perennial flowers, grasses
and sedges.
      (7)   The rain garden shall be maintained with minimal or no fertilizers;
no herbicides or pesticides will be used.

   (b)   Performance Guarantees. The Planning Commission, Board of Zoning
Appeals or Village Council, as applicable, may require an applicant to deposit
a performance guarantee to ensure compliance with this code, the completion of
improvements and to protect natural resources and the health, safety and
welfare of Village residents and the future users or inhabitants of the
project.
      (1)   A "performance guarantee" shall mean a cash deposit, certified
check, letter of credit or other legal surety approved by the Village in an
amount equal to the estimated cost for any improvements to be made, as
determined by the applicant and confirmed and verified by a representative of
the Village.
      (2)   The performance guarantee shall be deposited with the Village
before any building permits can be issued. The Treasurer shall retain the
performance guarantee, in accordance with this section.
      (3)   When a performance guarantee is required as a condition of
approval, the approving body shall also specify when the related improvement
must be completed.
      (4)   As the project is constructed, the Village may rebate money to the
applicant based on a reasonable proportion of the completed work, provided that
at least 10% shall be retained for each related element until the entire
project has been satisfactorily completed. The Village may solicit the opinion
of a civil engineer or other licensed professional in the State of Ohio to
determine the value of the completed work.
      (5)   Once a project has been satisfactorily completed, as determined by
the Zoning Administrator, and all the landscaping (if required) has been
established, the Treasurer shall return any remaining funds to the applicant.
The Village may retain up to 10% of the performance guarantee to cover any
administrative or consultant costs directly associated with reviewing and/or
inspecting any improvements.
      (6)   In the event an applicant does not make the improvements for which
the performance guarantee was required within the established time period, or
if improvements are not constructed in accordance with this zoning code and/or
any required conditions and attempts to attain compliance are unsuccessful, the
Village may enter the subject property and complete the improvements using the
performance guarantee to cover costs.
      (7)   In the event an applicant does not make or complete the
improvements and the performance guarantee is insufficient to allow the Village
to complete them, the applicant shall be required to pay the Village an amount
necessary to complete the improvements, plus any administrative or legal fees.

1272.05   ENFORCEMENT; PENALTY.
   (a)   Penalties. Any owner, person or entity that is found to be in
violation or assists in the violation of this zoning code shall, for each
violation or noncompliance, be guilty of a fourth degree misdemeanor and be
subject to a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).  Each day during which a
violation occurs shall be a separate offense.
   (b)   Enforcement Process.  The Zoning Administrator, along with such other
person or persons necessary, shall enforce the provisions of the zoning code. 
The following process shall be followed in the enforcement of this code:
      (1)   Upon complaint and/or credible information of a possible zoning 
code violation, based upon personal knowledge or other information, the Zoning
Administrator will investigate the matter and submit a written report
(including relevant photos of the violation, map of the property or other
attachments) to the Village Manager.
      (2)   If the Zoning Administrator believes there is probable cause that a
violation has or is occurring, then he or she shall take one or more of the
following actions to resolve the violation:
         A.   The Zoning Administrator may speak to the property owner and
attempt to resolve the matter through discussion and/or request that the
property owner work with the Village through the Village mediation program. If
discussion and/or mediation resolves the matter, the Zoning Administrator shall
inspect the property for compliance as soon as practical.  If the Zoning
Administrator does not believe that the mediation process is resolving or would
resolve the matter, he or she does not have to engage in or continue with
mediation.
         B.   In addition to, or in lieu of the mediation procedure, the Zoning
Administrator may also send a certified letter to the property owner(s).  Below
the return address on the envelope, the words "Address Service Requested" will
appear. Alternatively, the letter may be personally served in the same manner
as a civil complaint. The letter shall cite the section number of the ordinance
and the offense and explain what must be done to bring the property into
compliance with the ordinance.  The property owner will be given 30 days to
bring the property into compliance. The property address and parcel
identification number shall be referenced in the letter and any photos of the
violation as it existed on the date of investigation shall also be included.
The letter will be signed by the Zoning Administrator or other Village official
who has direct knowledge of the violations.
         C.   The property will be inspected on or as soon as possible after
the specified compliance date.
         D.   If the property owner(s) has not complied, the matter will be
referred to either the Municipal Prosecutor or Mayor’s Court at the discretion
of the Police Department.
   (c)   The Village may bring legal action to address any violation of this
zoning code, any enforcement order of the Zoning Administrator, or any term or
condition of a planned unit development, conditional use, site plan approval,
variance or other entitlement issued under this code, or to collect unpaid
fines.
   (d)   The penalties associated with a violation of this zoning code are in
addition to, not in lieu of, any other penalty applicable under Ohio law or any
legal remedy available to the Village.

hearings, except that the Council may question any of the parties represented
in the record.

by the Zoning Administrator, by any other reviewing body and by the public,
together with the record of public hearings and meetings. The record of

subordinate body shall be considered a final administrative decision and not
subject to an additional appeal to Council.

requirements and height, shall be in harmony with the intent and purposes of
the code, as provided below.
   (a)   Variance Standards. Variances from the terms of the code shall be
granted only where the applicant shows that the strict application of a zoning
requirement causes practical difficulties in the use of the property. The
factors to be considered and weighed by the Board in determining whether a
property owner has encountered practical difficulties in the use of the
property include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water distribution, sanitary sewer collection,
electric distribution, storm water collection, or refuse collection;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (7)   Whether the existing conditions from which a variance is being
sought were self-created; and
      (8)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (b)   The Board shall determine, after weighing the factors described above
and any other factors the Board deems relevant, whether the property owner has
shown practical difficulties so inequitable as to justify granting a variance
to the property owner.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1278.05   ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL.
   (a)   An administrative appeal of an order, requirement, decision or

administration of this code must be submitted no more than 20 calendar days
after the action or decision has been made that is being appealed.
   (b)   A submitted application for an administrative appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning
Administrator certifies to Village Council, after the notice of appeal is
filed, that by reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, and upon concurrence by the
Council, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order
which may be granted by a court of record.
   (c)   In deciding the appeal, the Board shall determine whether or not the
decision that was made was done so using the proper requirements and standards
in this code. The decision of the Board is limited to the information that was
available to the administrative official or body who made the decision being
appealed.
   (d)   Decision.  After the Board of Zoning Appeals public hearing and

CHAPTER 1282
Nonconforming Uses, Buildings and Lots
1282.01   Intent.
1282.02   Non-reversion.
1282.03   Nonconforming uses.
1282.04   Nonconforming buildings and structures.
1282.05   Nonconforming lots of record.
1282.01   INTENT.
   (a)   It is recognized that there exist within zoning districts certain
uses, buildings, structures and lots that were lawful before this code was
passed or amended, but are now prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this code. It is the intent to permit these legal nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuance.
   (b)   Nonconforming uses, buildings, structures and lots are declared by
this zoning code to be incompatible with the provisions of the districts in
which they are located. It is the intent of this code that these
nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded, or extended, except as
otherwise permitted in this chapter, nor be used as grounds for adding other
buildings, structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the district.
   (c)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this code and upon which actual building construction has been
diligently conducted.
   (d)   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as authorization for, or
approval of, the continuance of the use of a structure or premises in violation
of any regulation in effect at the time of the adoption of this code.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1282.02   NON-REVERSION.
   Any nonconforming use or structure that is changed, in whole or in part, for
any reason to a conforming use or structure, or to a use or structure that is
closer to conformity than it was prior to the change, shall to that extent
thereafter continue to be used or arranged for a conforming use or more
conforming use, or shall continue to be a conforming or more conforming
structure, and shall not revert to its prior nonconforming status, or to a less
conforming use or structure, at any time in the future.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1282.03   NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land or building than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code.
   (b)   No part of any nonconforming use shall be moved unless that movement
eliminates or reduces the nonconformity.
   (c)   If a nonconforming use is abandoned for any reason for a period of
more than one year, any subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of
this code. A nonconforming use shall be determined to be abandoned if one or
more of the following conditions exists, which shall be deemed to constitute an
intent on the part of the property owner to abandon the nonconforming use:
      (1)   Utilities, such as water, gas and electricity to the property, have
been disconnected;
      (2)   The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair;
      (3)   Signs or other indications of the existence of the nonconforming
use have been removed;
      (4)   Equipment or fixtures necessary for the operation of the
nonconforming use have been removed;
      (5)   Other actions which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator,
constitute an intention on the part of the property owner or lessee to abandon
the nonconforming use.
   (d)   A building or structure containing a nonconforming use, other than a
single- family detached dwelling, which is damaged by explosion, fire, flood,
wind or other Act of God to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement value
immediately prior to damage, shall not be reestablished except in conformance
with the requirements of this zoning code, unless an exception is granted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with subsection (e), below. In the
event that the Zoning Administrator's estimate of the extent of damage or
replacement value is not acceptable to the property owner or applicant for a
zoning permit to repair or reconstruct the building or structure, the applicant
may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (e)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a building containing a
nonconforming use to be enlarged, provided that the Board finds that all of the
following are true:
      (1)   The enlargement is necessary and incidental to the existing use of
the building.
      (2)   The enlargement conforms to the height, yard and area requirements
of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (3)   The enlargement does not prevent the future use of the structure
for a conforming use.
      (4)   The enlargement is not detrimental to present and potential
surrounding uses, will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this zoning code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the
Village.
   (f)   A detached single-family residential dwelling that is nonconforming
because it is in a Business, Industrial or other district where it is now
disallowed shall be considered conditionally permitted, and it may be enlarged,
extended or structurally altered, provided that it meets the requirements for a
single-family dwelling in the R-C District. If the dwelling is damaged by
explosion, fire, flood, wind or other Act of God to the extent of 50% or more
of its replacement value immediately prior to damage, it may be reconstructed,
provided that no nonconformity is increased and no new nonconformity is
created.
   (g)   Any change to a nonconforming use may only be toward bringing the use
into conformance; however, a nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use provided all of the following determinations are made by the
Board of Zoning Appeals:
      (1)   The proposed use shall be as compatible, or more compatible, with
the surrounding neighborhood than the previous nonconforming use, considering
factors such as hours of operation, traffic, noise and similar external
impacts.
      (2)   The proposed nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased,
nor extended to occupy a greater area of land or building area than the
previous nonconforming use.
      (3)   That appropriate conditions and safeguards are provided that will
ensure compliance with the intent and purpose of this zoning code.
(Ord. 2013-19. Passed 9-16-13.)
1282.04   NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Where a lawful nonconforming building or structure exists at the
effective date of this zoning code, or an amendment thereto, that does not
comply with the requirements of this code because of restrictions such as floor
area, lot coverage, width, height, or setbacks, that building or structure may
continue to be occupied and used as long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)    No nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged or altered
in a way that increases its nonconformity, except in cases in which the setback
of a building or structure is nonconforming by 50% or less of the distance
required by this code. Only in these cases may the nonconformin g setback be
extended along the same plane as the existing nonconformin g setback, provided
that in so doing, the setback itself is not further reduced.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2979.jpg]
 
      (2)   In the event that a nonconforming building or structure is
destroyed to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement value, exclusive of
the foundation, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the
provisions of this code; provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals may, upon
application, permit the reconstruction of the nonconforming building or
structure if all of the following conditions are met:
         A.   The prior nonconforming condition(s) shall not be increased.
         B.   The new building or structure shall be placed on the original
foundation, unless the building or structure could be so located as to reduce
the extent of its nonconformity on the lot.
         C.   The application to reconstruct the nonconforming building or
structure shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator within six months of the
event in which the building or structure was damaged or destroyed.
         D.   The reconstruction of the building or structure shall not be
detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood.
      (3)   If a nonconforming building or structure is moved for any reason
and for any distance, it shall be moved to a location which complies with the
requirements of this code.
   (b)   None of the provisions of this section are meant to preclude normal

1422.01  1998 EDITION ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by and for the
Village the Ohio Basic Building Code (OBBC), being particularly the 1998
edition thereof, as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards, Department
of Industrial Relations, and as published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC), save and except such portions thereof as may be
hereinafter amended or deleted.
1422.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the OBBC, as adopted in Section
1422.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.

1470.01  PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the elimination of vacant
structures which have become attractive nuisances and which are a blight upon
the neighborhood in which they are located and are likely to contribute to
crime or losses by fire and accidents.
(Ord. 1967-9.  Passed 10-10-67.)
1470.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply:
   (a)   “Public nuisance” means any fence, wall, garage, shed, house,
building, structure, tree, pole, smokestack, excavation, basement, cellar,
well, cistern or sidewalk subspace, swimming pool or spa, or part thereof,
which, by reason of the condition in which the same is permitted to be or
remain, shall or may endanger the health, life, limb or property of, or cause
any hurt, harm, inconvenience, discomfort, damage or injury to, any one or more
persons in the Village in any one or more of the following ways:
      (1)   By reason of being detrimental to the general health of the
community;
      (2)   By reason of being a fire hazard;
      (3)   By reason of being unsafe for occupancy, or use on, in, upon, about
or around the aforesaid premises;
      (4)   By reason of continued vacancy, thereby resulting in a lack of
reasonable or adequate maintenance of structures and grounds and causing
deterioration and a blighting influence on nearby properties and thereby
depreciating the enjoyment and use of the property in the immediate vicinity to
such an extent that it is harmful to the community in which such structure is
situated.
   (b)   “Owner” means an owner of record of the premises in fee or a lesser
estate therein, a mortgagee or vendee in possession, an assignee of the rents,
or a receiver, executor, administrator, trustee, lessee or other person, firm

   Whenever the Village Manager suspects the existence of a public nuisance in
the Village, he or she shall promptly cause to be inspected the premises on
which he or she suspects such public nuisance exists. Should the Manager find
that a public nuisance does exist, he or she shall promptly notify any two of
the following: the Fire Chief of Miami Township Fire Rescue; the Greene County
Combined Health District; or the Chief Building Official of Greene County or
their duly authorized agents. The two selected agencies shall cause to be
inspected the premises on which it is suspected such public nuisance exists.
Written reports of such inspection with respect to the existence of the public
nuisance shall be filed with the Manager.
   Should all of the aforesaid officers or their duly authorized agents agree
that a public nuisance exists, it shall be the duty of the Manager to cause
photographs of such nuisances to be made and to file and keep in his or her
office the written reports of the findings of the aforesaid officials or their
agents. The Manager shall cause a written notice to be served on such owner
stating the findings with respect to the existence of a public nuisance and
stating that unless the owner or owners thereof cause the abatement of the
public nuisance by removal of the building or structure the same will be abated
by the Village at the expense of such owner or owners.  Such abatement shall
start within fifteen days after service of such notice and shall be completed
within forty-five days or such additional time as the Manager may deem
necessary to complete the removal.

service of the written notice is not perfected by any of the hereinbefore
described methods, then the Village Manager shall cause such notice to be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village once each week
for two consecutive weeks and shall further cause a copy of the notice to be
left with the person, if any, in possession of the premises on which it is
alleged such public nuisance exists, or, if there is no person in possession
thereof, he or she shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted on the
premises. The Manager shall cause a return of service in the form of an
affidavit to be made by the person who served it, which affidavit shall set
forth the name and address of the person served, the manner of service and the
date thereof.

REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS.
   Upon being served notice, the owner or owners may make immediate application

undertake the repairs or replacement of items found to constitute a public
nuisance. Plans and specifications as required by the Manager covering the
repairs or replacements shall be furnished by the owner or owners to the
Manager within fifteen days after receipt of notice or such additional time as
the Manager may deem necessary to complete plans and specifications, not to
exceed ninety days. The Manager shall, upon approval of the plans and
specifications, cause a special building permit to be issued to the owner or
owners, which permit shall be valid for a period of thirty days. Within such
thirty days the owner or owners must effect and complete such repairs and/or
replacements unless the Village Manager grants an extension of the special
building permit, which extension may be granted if the owner or owners show
reason or cause for it and if it will more readily effect the repairs and/or
replacements.
(Ord. 1967-9. Passed 10-10-67.)
1470.06  APPEALS.
   The owner or owners may, within ten days after completion of service of the
notice, make a demand in writing to the Village Manager for a hearing on the
question of whether in fact a public nuisance exists. The hearing shall be held
within ten days following receipt of the written demand, and at least two days
notice in writing of the hearing shall be given to the owner or owners. The
hearing shall be conducted by the Board of Appeals, pursuant to Section 69 of
the Village Charter. In the event of an appeal to Council of the Board's
decision, a majority of the Council present must concur that a public nuisance
exists before enforcement of the abatement is carried out. A copy of the
decision of Council shall be promptly served upon the owner or owners in the
manner hereinbefore provided for.
(1971 Code § 1333.06)
1470.07  ABATEMENT BY VILLAGE; COSTS.
   (a)   Should a public nuisance not be abated at the expiration time stated
in the notice or upon the expiration of the time stated in the special building
permit issued by the Village Manager or such additional time as Council may
grant, the Manager shall be authorized, at any time thereafter, to enter upon
such premises, and the owner shall permit him or her entry to abate the
nuisance by demolition and removal of the structure or by taking any other such
action as may be required.
   (b)   In abating such nuisance the Manager may call upon any department of
the Village for whatever assistance may be necessary, or may, by private
contract, obtain the abatement thereof. The cost of such private contract shall
be paid for from Village funds specifically authorized by Council in order to
abate such public nuisance.

necessary to complete the abatement of the same, and the cost of the abatement

the cost of the abatement. The bill for the cost of the abatement shall be paid
within sixty days after receipt of the bill.

of the abatement to be levied as an assessment and recovered in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. 1967-9. Passed 10-10-67.)
