person, to allow the interment of a body without first receiving such permit.

licensed funeral director. The applicant shall also file with the burial permit
an application containing the name, age, sex, race and cause of death of the
deceased person for the records of the Cemetery Board. Upon completion of

which shall entitle the applicant to bury a deceased person in the municipal
cemetery. In the event that the removal of the body of any deceased person
is requested, the City shall issue no permit until the applicant shall have
first complied with the laws of the State of Nebraska with respect to such

subdivision. If no person appears to claim such lot or subdivision and pay all
delinquent assessments with interest within 15 days after the last date of
such publication, the Cemetery Board may by resolution reclaim such lot or
subdivision. Such reclamation shall be complete upon a filing of a verified
copy of such resolution, together with proof of publication, in the office of

A. Unless otherwise provided by law, the governing body may propose to
revise the previously adopted budget statement and shall conduct a

(1) There are circumstances which could not reasonably have been
anticipated at the time the budget for the current year was
adopted;
(2) The budget adopted violated Neb. RS 13-518 to 13-522, such that

insufficient, additional expenses will be necessarily incurred, or
there is a need to reduce the budget requirements to comply with
Neb RS. 13-518 to 13-522; or
(3) The governing body has been notified by the Auditor of Public
Accounts of a mathematical or accounting error or noncompliance

for what purpose;
(3) A statement setting forth the nature of the unanticipated
circumstances and, if the budget requirements are to be increased,
the reasons why the previously adopted budget of expenditures
cannot be reduced during the remainder of the current year to
meet the need for additional money in that manner;
(4) A copy of the summary of the originally adopted budget previously
published; and
(5) A copy of the summary of the proposed revised budget.

§ 44-1.13. Sinking funds.
The governing body, subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall have
the power to levy a tax not to exceed three mills on the dollar in any one
year upon the assessed value of all taxable property within the municipality,
except intangible property, for a term not to exceed 10 years in addition
to the amount of tax which may be annually levied for the purposes of
the adopted budget statement of the municipality, for the purpose of
establishing a sinking fund for the construction, purchase, improvement,
extension, or repair of the approved uses as authorized by state law. To
initiate the sinking fund, the governing body shall declare its purpose
by resolution to submit to the qualified electors of the municipality the
proposition to provide the improvement at the next general municipal
election. The resolution shall set forth the improvement, the estimated cost,
the amount of the annual levy, the number of years required to provide
the required revenue, the name of the sinking fund proposed, and the
proposition as it will appear on the ballot. Notice of the proposition shall

and approval of the proposed revised budget by the governing body, the
governing body shall file with the County Clerk of the county or
counties in which such governing body is located, and with the Auditor
of Public Accounts, a copy of the revised budget, as adopted. The
governing body may then issue warrants in payment for expenditures
authorized by the adopted revised budget. Such warrants shall be
referred to as "registered warrants" and shall be repaid during the next
fiscal year from funds derived from taxes levied therefor.
E. Within 30 days after the adoption of the budget under Neb. RS 13-506,
a governing body may, or within 30 days after notification of an error by
the Auditor of Public Accounts a governing body shall, correct an
adopted budget which contains a clerical, mathematical or accounting
error which does not affect the total amount budgeted by more than 1%
or increase the amount required from property taxes. No public hearing
shall be required for such a correction. After correction, the governing
body shall file a copy of the corrected budget with the County Clerk of
the county or counties in which such governing body is located and with
the Auditor of Public Accounts. The governing body may then issue
warrants in payment for expenditures authorized by the budget. (Neb.

conformity with the provisions of the proposition, and applicable state law.
The funds received by the Municipal Treasurer shall, as they accumulate,
be immediately invested with the written approval of the governing body in
the manner provided by state law. No sinking fund so established shall be

the ballot unless the governing body is authorized to do so by 60% of the
qualified electors of the municipality voting at a general election favoring
such a change in the use of the sinking fund. (Neb. RS 19-1301 through

mutual financial institutions of approved and responsible standing, all
money collected, received or held by him or her as City Treasurer. Such
deposits shall be subject to all regulations imposed by law or adopted
by the City Council for the receiving and holding thereof. The fact that a
stockholder, director, or other officer of such bank, capital stock
financial institution, or qualifying mutual financial institution shall also
be serving as Mayor, as a member of the City Council, or as any other
officer of such municipality, shall not disqualify such bank, capital stock

acting as a depository for such municipal funds. Neb. RS 77-2366 shall
apply to deposits in capital stock financial institutions. Neb. RS
77-2365.01 shall apply to deposits in qualifying mutual financial

situated within the boundaries of the county, or a county adjoining
thereto, where the City is situated, if the City is the depositor, as well as
in a commercial state or national bank if the cooperative credit
association performs all the conditions precedent required by the laws
of this state of commercial state and national banks to qualify them to
receive deposits of such public funds. It shall not be necessary for the
City, in making such a deposit of public funds, to purchase shares in
such cooperative credit association or become a member thereof, and
such a cooperative credit association is hereby authorized and
empowered to receive such money under such conditions.

of this Code. The certificates of deposit purchased and time deposits made
shall bear interest and shall be secured as set forth in this Code, except

require each depository to give bond for the safekeeping and payment
of such deposits and the accretions thereof, which bond shall run to the
City and be approved by the Mayor. Such bond shall be conditioned that
such a depository shall, at the end of every quarter, render to the
Treasurer a statement in duplicate, showing the several daily balances,
the amount of money of the City held by it during the quarter, the
amount of the accretion thereto, and how credited. The bond shall also
be conditioned that the depository shall generally do and perform
whatever may be required by the provisions of this Code and faithfully
discharge the trust reposed in such depository. Such bond shall be as
nearly as practicable in the form provided in Neb. RS 77-2304. No
person in any way connected with any depository as an officer or
stockholder shall be accepted as a surety on any bond given by the
depository of which he or she is an officer or stockholder. Such bond
shall be deposited with the City Clerk. Neb. RS 77-2366 shall apply to
deposits in capital stock financial institutions. Neb. RS 77-2365.01 shall
apply to deposits in qualifying mutual financial institutions. (Neb. RS
16-714)
B. The insurance or guarantee afforded to depositors in banks, capital
stock financial institutions, or qualifying mutual financial institutions
through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall be deemed
and construed to be a surety bond to the extent that the deposits are
insured or guaranteed by such corporation; and for deposits so insured
or guaranteed, no other surety bond or other security shall be
required.32

financial institution, or qualifying mutual financial institution giving a
personal bond, more than the amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation plus one-half of the amount of the bond of
such bank, capital stock financial institution, or qualifying mutual financial

stock financial institution, or qualifying mutual financial institution shall not
in either case exceed the amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation plus the paid-up capital stock and surplus of
such bank, capital stock financial institution, or qualifying mutual financial
institution. The City Treasurer shall not be liable for any loss sustained by
reason of the failure of any such bonded depository whose bond has been

all sources separately stated as to each such source, the actual
unencumbered cash balance available at the beginning of the
year, the amount received from taxation, and the amount of
actual and estimated expenditure, whichever is applicable;
(c) For the immediately ensuing fiscal year, an estimate of revenue
from all sources separately stated as to each such source, the

applicable, to be available at the beginning of the year, the
amounts proposed to be expended during the fiscal year, and
the amount of cash reserve based on actual experience of prior
years; and
(d) A uniform summary of the proposed budget statement which
shall include a total of all funds maintained for the proprietary
function.

fiscal year and shall note whether or not such reserve is
encumbered. The cash reserve projections shall be based upon the
actual experience of prior years.

written report shall be kept of such hearing. If the adopted
proprietary budget statement reflects a change from the proposed
proprietary statement presented at the hearing, a copy of the

Municipal Clerk within 20 days after its adoption and published in a
newspaper of general circulation within the governing body's
jurisdiction or by mailing to each resident within the governing
body's jurisdiction.
E. If the actual expenditures for a proprietary function exceed the
estimated expenditures in the proprietary budget statement during its
fiscal year, the governing body shall adopt a proprietary function
reconciliation statement within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year
which reflects any difference between the adopted proprietary budget
statement for the previous fiscal year and the actual expenditures and
revenue for such fiscal year. After the adoption of a proprietary function
reconciliation statement, it shall be filed with the Municipal Clerk and
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the governing
body's jurisdiction or by mailing to each resident within the governing
body's jurisdiction. If the difference between the adopted proprietary
budget for the previous fiscal year and the actual expenditures and

30 days nor more than 60 days from the date the governing body
received notification pursuant to § 72-2.6.
E. If a majority of voters voting on the initiative measure shall vote in favor
of such measure, it shall become a valid and binding measure of the
municipality 30 days after certification of the election results, unless

referendum shall not be reenacted or returned to its original form
except by a two-thirds majority of the members of the governing body.
No such attempt to reenact or return the measure to its original form
shall be made within one year of the repeal or amendment of the

meeting of the governing body scheduled outside the corporate limits

meeting.44
B. The minutes of the Municipal Clerk shall include the record of the

A. Any public body may hold a closed session by the affirmative vote of a
majority of its voting members if a closed session is clearly necessary
for the protection of the public interest or for the prevention of needless
injury to the reputation of an individual and if such individual has not
requested a public meeting. The subject matter and the reason
necessitating the closed session shall be identified in the motion to
close.
(1) Closed sessions may be held for, but shall not be limited to, such
reasons as:
(a) Strategy sessions with respect to collective bargaining, real
estate purchases, pending litigation or litigation which is
imminent as evidenced by communication of a claim or threat

concluded shall be recorded in the minutes. If the motion to close
passes, then immediately prior to the closed session the presiding
officer shall restate on the record the limitation of the subject matter of
the closed session. The public body holding such a closed session shall
restrict its consideration to matters during the closed portions to only
those purposes set forth in the motion to close as the reason for the
closed session. The meeting shall be reconvened in open session before
any formal action may be taken. For purposes of this section, "formal
action" shall mean a collective decision or a collective commitment or
promise to make a decision on any question, motion, proposal,

Such challenge shall be overruled only by a majority vote of the
members of the public body. Such challenge and its disposition shall be

circumventing the Open Meetings Act (Neb. RS 84-1407 through

there is no meeting of the body then intentionally convened, if there is
no vote or other action taken regarding any matter over which the

Bonds
§ 85-17.1. Councilmen.65
Each Councilman, before entering upon the duties of his office, shall be
required to give a bond or evidence of equivalent insurance to the
municipality. The bond shall be with two or more good and sufficient
sureties or some responsible surety company. If the bond is given by two
sureties, they shall each justify that he is worth at least $2,000 over and
above all debts and exemptions. Such bond or insurance amounts shall
be on file in the office of the Municipal Clerk and shall be conditioned
on the faithful discharge of the duties of the Councilman. The bond or
insurance will be further conditioned that if the Councilman shall vote for
any expenditure or appropriation of money or create any liability in excess
of the amount allowed by law, the Councilman and the sureties signing the
bond shall be liable thereon. The bond shall be filed with the Clerk and
approved by the Mayor. Upon approval, the City may pay the premium for
such bond. Any liability sought to be incurred, or debt created in excess
of the amount limited or authorized by law, shall be taken and held by any
court of the state as the joint and several liability of the Councilman voting
for and the Mayor approving such liability, obligation, or debt. Any such
liability or debt shall not be an obligation upon the municipality. Voting
for or approving of such liability or debt shall be conclusive evidence of
malfeasance in office. Any Councilman voting for such an appropriation or
any Mayor approving of the same may be removed from office. In the event
that any Councilman has not filed proper bond or insurance, as required
herein, prior to entering upon the duties of his office, said office shall be
declared vacant and shall be filled by appointment as provided in § 85-1.3
of this chapter. (Neb. RS 16-304)
§ 85-17.2. Form.
Official bonds of the municipality shall be in form, joint and several, and
shall be made payable to the municipality in such penalty as the governing
body may set by resolution, which sums shall be on file at the office of
the Municipal Clerk; provided the penalty amount on any bond shall not
fall below the legal minimum, when one has been set by the State of
Nebraska, for each particular official. All official bonds of the municipal
officials shall be executed by the principal named in such bonds and by at
least two sufficient sureties who shall be freeholders of the county, or by the
official as principal and by a guaranty, surety, fidelity, or bonding company;
provided no municipal official, while still in his official term of office, shall
be accepted as surety on any other official's bond, contractor's bond, license
bond, or appeal bond under any circumstances. Only companies that are

legally authorized to transact business in the State of Nebraska shall be
eligible for suretyship on the bond of an official of the municipality. All said
bonds shall obligate the principal and sureties for the faithful discharge of
all duties required by law of such principal, and shall inure to the benefit
of the municipality and any persons who may be injured by a breach of the
conditions of such bonds. No bond shall be deemed to be given or complete
until the approval of the governing board, and all sureties are endorsed in
writing on the instrument by the Mayor and Municipal Clerk pursuant to the
approval of the governing body. The premium on any official bond required
to be given may be paid out of the General Fund, or other proper municipal
fund, upon a resolution to that effect by the governing body at the beginning
of any municipal year. All official bonds, meeting the conditions herein, shall
be filed with the Municipal Clerk for his official records and it shall be the
duty of the Municipal Clerk to furnish a certified copy of any bond so filed
upon the payment of a fee which shall be set by resolution of the governing
body. In the event that the sureties on the official bond of any officer of
the municipality, in the opinion of the governing body, become insufficient,
the governing body may, by resolution, fix a reasonable time within which
the officer may give a new bond or additional sureties as directed. In the
event that the officer should fail, refuse, or neglect to give a new bond, or
additional sureties to the satisfaction and approval of the governing body,
then the office shall by such failure, refusal, or neglect become vacant,
and it shall be the duty of the governing body to appoint a competent and
qualified person to fill the office. Any official who is reelected to office shall
be required to file a new bond after each election. (Neb. RS 11-103 through

Prior to certifying to the Mayor the names of the persons eligible for the

vacancy, may decline to fill the vacancy, or may order that another
examination be held by the Civil Service Commission.

§ 95-1.2. Probationary period.

be deemed complete until after the expiration of a period of six months from
the date of employment and successful completion of certification by the
Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center for Police Officers, as may be
provided in the rules of the Civil Service Commission, during which time
the Mayor, with the approval of the Council, may terminate the employment
of the person appointed by him or her if, during the performance test this
afforded and upon an observation or consideration of the performance of
duty, the Mayor deems such person unfit or unsatisfactory for service in
the department. The Mayor, with the approval of the Council, may appoint
one of the other persons certified by the Commission and such person
shall likewise enter upon such duties until some person is found who is
fit for appointment, employment or promotion for the probationary period
provided and then the appointment, employment, or promotion shall be

1:185
fitness of the employee or precludes the employee from properly
performing the functions and duties of his or her position;
(5) Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor tending to injure the
employee's ability to effectively perform the duties of his or her
position; or
(6) Any other act or failure to act which, in the judgment of the Civil
Service Commissioners, is sufficient to justify the offender to be an
unsuitable and unfit person to be employed in the public service.
C. Disciplinary action procedure.
(1) No employee in the civil service who shall have been permanently
appointed or inducted into civil service shall be removed,
suspended, demoted, or discharged, except for cause and then only

citizen or taxpayer.
(2) The written accusation shall set forth the alleged misconduct,
charges, or grounds for investigation against the employee. The
written accusation shall be filed by the complainant with the
Secretary of the Commission, who shall cause a copy of such
written accusation to be delivered within 72 hours after the filing to
a) the Police Chief, b) the Mayor, and c) the employee personally or
by certified mail, addressed to the employee at the residence
address of the employee shown in the personnel records. The
Secretary of the Commission shall cause a return showing such
delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the Secretary's
office.
(3) The Police Chief shall have the authority to immediately suspend,
with pay, an employee against whom such written accusation has
been filed, pending the confirmation of the suspension, or a
decision of the Mayor to reinstate the employee, remove, demote,
discharge, or suspend the employee, with or without pay.
(4) Prior to the decision of the Mayor to reinstate the employee or
remove, demote, discharge, or suspend the employee, with or
without pay, the Police Chief shall, within a reasonable period of
time, investigate the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds
against the employee and explain the basis of the employer's
evidence to the employee and provide the employee an opportunity
to present his or her version of the circumstances which resulted in
the filing of the written accusation. If the Chief's investigation
reveals other misconduct, charges, or grounds, the Chief shall
amend the written accusation to include the other misconduct,
charges, or grounds by filing an amendment to the written
accusation with the Secretary of the Commission, who shall cause a
copy of such amended accusation to be delivered within 72 hours
after the filing to a) the Police Chief, b) the Mayor, and c) the
employee personally or by certified mail, addressed to the
§ 95-1.3 SEWARD CODE § 95-1.3
1:186
employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the
personnel records. The Secretary of the Commission shall cause a
return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed
in the Secretary's office. In the event that a Police Chief is being
disciplined, the Mayor shall follow the same procedures as are
followed by the Police Chief in disciplining employees under the
Act. Upon completion of this procedure within a reasonable period
of time, the Police Chief shall recommend in writing to the Mayor
that the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds set forth in the
written accusation be deemed 1) to be without merit; 2) to not
warrant disciplinary action, 3) to warrant disciplinary action less
severe than removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or
without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand, or 4) to warrant
removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension with or without pay.
(5) Within 20 calendar days after receiving the written
recommendation of the Police Chief, the Mayor shall decide to
accept the recommendation of the Police Chief, or shall decide that
the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds for investigation
against the employee set forth in the written accusation be
deemed: a) to be without merit, b) to not warrant disciplinary
action, c) to warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal,
demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or without pay, such as an
oral or written reprimand, or d) to warrant removal, demotion,
discharge, or suspension, with or without pay. If a discharge is
being recommended, Council approval shall be required. The
Mayor shall file a copy of his or her decision, within 25 calendar
days after receiving the written recommendation of the Police
Chief, with the Secretary of the Commission, who shall cause a
copy of such decision to be filed within 72 hours after the filing to 1)
the Police Chief, and 2) the employee, personally or by certified
mail, addressed to the employee at the residence address of the
employee shown in the personnel records. The Secretary of the
Commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing
to be executed and filed in the Secretary's office.
(6) Any employee so removed, suspended, demoted or discharged may,
within 10 calendar days after receiving written notice of the
Mayor's decision, file a written demand for an investigation and
public hearing by the Civil Service Commission. The employee shall
file the request for the hearing with the Secretary of the
Commission and simultaneously send a copy of the request to the
Mayor. The failure to file such request with the Secretary of the

Building Inspector
§ 225-1.1. Power and authority.
The Building Inspector shall be the municipal official who shall have the
duty of enforcing all building and housing regulations of the municipality.
The Building Inspector shall inspect all buildings repaired, altered, built,
or moved in the municipality as often as necessary to ensure compliance
with all municipal ordinances. The Building Inspector shall have the power
and authority to order all work stopped on any construction, alteration,
or relocation which violates any building or housing regulations of the
municipality. The Building Inspector shall issue permission to continue
any construction, alteration, or relocation when the Building Inspector is
satisfied that no provision will be violated. If the stop order is an oral one,
it shall be followed by a written stop order within 24 hours. Such written
order may be served by any municipal police officer. (Neb. RS 16-308)
§ 225-1.2. Right of lawful entry.
It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to inspect, as often as
necessary, any building which is being constructed, altered, repaired or
relocated to determine if the work being done therein is in conformity with
all municipal building and housing regulations.
§ 225-1.3. Appeal from decisions; variances.
In the event it is claimed that the true intent and meaning of this chapter
has been wrongly interpreted by the Building Inspector; that the time
allowed for compliance with any order of the Building Inspector is too short;
or that conditions peculiar to a particular building make it unreasonably
difficult to meet the literal requirements prescribed by this chapter and the
Building Inspector, the owner, his agent, or the occupant may file a notice of
appeal within a reasonable time after the decision or order of the Building
Inspector has been made. The Board of Adjustment shall hear all appeals
and shall have the power and authority, when appealed to, to modify the
decision or order of the Building Inspector. Such a decision shall be final,
subject only to any remedy which the aggrieved person may have at law or
equity. Applications for review shall be in writing and shall state the reasons
why the variance should be made. A variance to the interpretation of the
code shall be granted only where it is evident that reasonable safety and
sanitation are assured and may include conditions not generally specified
by this code to achieve that end. A copy of any variance so granted shall be
sent to both the Building Inspector and the applicant.
§ 225-1.4. Plans, maps and specifications.
A municipal official charged with the duty or responsibility of accepting
or approving plans, specifications, geological maps, and reports shall not

Building Permits
§ 225-2.1. Building permit required; application; fees.107
Any person desiring to commence or proceed to erect, construct, enlarge,
alter, repair, improve, remove, convert or demolish any building or dwelling,
or cause the same to be done, shall file with the Building Official an
application for a building permit. The application shall be in writing on a
form to be furnished by the Building Official for that purpose. Every such
application shall set forth the legal description of the land upon which the
construction, relocation or demolition is to take place, the nature of the
use or occupancy, the principal dimensions of the building or dwelling,
the estimated cost, the names of the owner, architect, and contractor, and
such other information as may be requested thereon. Applications shall
be accompanied by three sets of building plans. The Building Official will
be responsible for the issuing of permits, plan review, collecting of permit
fees, and ensuring that the repairing, remodeling or new construction is in
compliance with zoning district regulations, and all adopted City building
and housing codes. Fees payable upon a permit granted for the work listed
and above set forth shall be based on the estimated costs as listed in
Subsections A through H below:
A. Valuation schedule - residential.
(1) Residential construction fees shall be assessed in accordance with
the provisions of this section. The method used for the
determination of value or valuation for the purpose of assessing the
permit fee shall be made by the Building Inspector calculated from
the square-footage costs provided below. The value to be used in
computing the building permit and plan review fees shall be the
total value of all construction work for which the permit is issued.
The valuation will be set forth during the plan review, figured at no
less than the following:
(a) Per square foot of finished new construction: $112.65.
(b) Per square foot for finished basement: $56.30.
(c) Per square foot for unfinished basement: $15.
(d) Per square foot for garage, attached or detached: $44.63.
(e) Note: The square footage costs indicated above are from the
Building and Standards tabulation charts. These costs are
periodically updated, and will be kept current by the Building
and Inspection Department for establishing the valuation.
107. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 225-2.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-2.1
1:255
(2) Once the valuation of the building has been established, the fee will
be calculated from the Fee Schedule provided below in Subsection
D.
B. Valuation schedule - commercial. The commercial fee for each building
permit shall be determined by the valuation provided by the owner and/
or contractor on the building permit application. However, during the
plan review this valuation will be adjusted to a valuation of no less than
the square footage construction costs provided by the Building and
Standards tabulation charts. Once the valuation of the building has
been established, the fee will be calculated from the Fee Schedule
provided below. The determination of value or valuation for the purpose
of assessing the permit fee shall be made by the Building Inspector. The
value to be used in computing the building permit and plan review fees
shall be the total value of all construction work for which the permit is
issued.
C. Valuation schedule method - remodels, additions, and accessory
buildings.
(1) For all additional types of building permits, such as for remodel/
additions and other accessory-type construction, the fees shall be
determined by the valuation set forth by the owner and/or
contractor on the building permit application. However, during the
plan review this valuation will be adjusted to a valuation of no less
than the square footage construction costs provided by Building
and Standards tabulation charts. Once the valuation of the building
has been established, the fee will be calculated from the Fee
Schedule provided below.
(2) The determination of value or valuation for the purpose of
assessing the permit fee shall be made by the Building Inspector.
The value to be used in computing the building permit and plan
review fees shall be the total value of all construction work for
which the permit is issued.
D. Building permit fee schedule.
(1) Once the valuation of the building has been established, the
subsequent fee will be calculated according to the fee schedule
established from time to time by the City Council.108
(2) Additional costs associated with the residential permit fee are as
follows:
(a) The plan review fee is equal to 10% of the building permit.
(b) Energy fees are valued at $25 per dwelling.
108. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).

permit fee calculated by valuation of construction of said structure.
F. Moving permit requirements. For the purposes of this section and
chapter, all houses and/or structures that are to be moved out of this
jurisdiction shall be treated as a demolition of a structure, and
therefore shall maintain the same fees and deposits as provided in
Subsection G of this section for the demolition of structures. All houses
and/or structures being moved into this jurisdiction shall be treated as a
new construction addition and meet the applicable code guidelines and

90 days from the expiration date, he or she shall lose all rights of his/her
license and proceed in the same manner as if he or she had never held a

violated the provisions of this code, he/she shall have the power to impose
any revocation or suspension clause contained within the context of this
article.

Administration
§ 237-1.1. Ownership; tax; Light Commissioner; rates and charges.
The municipality owns and operates the municipal electrical system through
the Light Commissioner. The governing body, for the purpose of defraying
the cost of the care, management, and maintenance of the municipal
electrical system, may each year levy a tax not exceeding the maximum
limit prescribed by state law, on the actual valuation of all real estate and
personal property within the corporate limits that is subject to taxation. The
revenue from the said tax shall be known as the Electrical Fund and shall
remain in the custody of the Municipal Treasurer. The Light Commissioner
shall have the direct management and control of the municipal electrical
system and shall faithfully carry out the duties of his office. He shall have
the authority to adopt rules and regulations for the safe and efficient
management of the electrical system, subject to the supervision and review
of the governing body. The governing body shall by ordinance set the rates
to be charged for services rendered and shall file the same in the office of
the Municipal Clerk for public inspection at any reasonable time. (Neb. RS

4-19-1988 by Ord. No. 5-88; 8-3-1999 by Ord. No. 28-99]
A. Every person or persons desiring electrical service must make
application therefor at the Utility Office located in City Hall. The
application must state truly and fully all uses to which said electric
current is to be applied and no additional use will be allowed.
B. For new consumers, blanks will be furnished for that purpose by the
Utility Office. All landlords shall make an application with the City to
receive electric service for their rental properties. This application shall
be signed one time only and shall place the responsibility for payment
of all usage on the landlord when any of his rental properties are not
rented. It shall be the duty of the landlord to notify the Utility Office of
any changes of electric usage by tenants on his properties. If the
landlord wishes to assume the responsibility for payment of electric
service on any of his rented or leased properties when they are rented,
he must so notify the Utility Office in writing upon blanks furnished for
that purpose. Upon receiving such notification, all bills will be mailed
directly to the landlord and he will be held responsible for their
payment. Otherwise, all requirements for service deposits must be met.
C. Applications for electrical service are not transferable. Any person
wishing to change from one location to another shall make a new
application. If any consumer shall sell, dispose, or remove from the
premises where service is furnished in his name, or if the premises is
destroyed by fire or other casualty, he shall at once inform the Utility

charged for all electricity used on the premises until the Utility Office
is otherwise advised of such circumstances.
D. The municipality, through its Electric Department, shall furnish electric
current for light and power purposes to persons whose premises abut
on any supply wire of the distribution system. The rules, regulations,
and rates for electric service, hereinafter named in this chapter, shall
be considered a part of every contract between every consumer now
served by the Electric Department. Without further formality, the
making of an application on the part of any applicant or the use or
consumption of electric energy by present consumers and the
furnishing of electric service to said applicant or consumer shall
constitute a contract between applicant and the municipality, to which
both parties are bound. If a consumer should violate any of the
provisions of said contract or any reasonable rules and regulations that
the Council may hereafter adopt, the Utility Office shall cause the
service to be disconnected from the building or place of such violation
and no further connection of electric service for such building or place
shall again be made except by order of the Utility Office.
E. Electric service will be discontinued upon the request of the consumer
at no cost. If the same consumer at some future time requests
restoration of the same electric service, a charge as set from time to
time by the City Council, payable in advance, will apply.177

may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Council. All such
funds shall be retained by the City as a guarantee of payment of all
charges and service fees incurred by the depositor. For deposits over
$500, interest will be payable for a one-year time period based on the
average rate of interest earned by the City on investments over the
immediate past 12 months preceding the return of the deposit. There
will be no charge made for electrical activation services.179
B. Utility deposits are in the nature of trust funds and shall be refunded to
consumers after two years of service and no delinquencies, audited and
allowed by the City Clerk-Treasurer and ordered paid out of the Electric
Fund with proper deductions made for arrearages or delinquencies due
the City, if any. Said utility deposit funds shall be refunded only to the
original depositor, or his/her estate, and are not transferable unless
approved by the City Clerk-Treasurer. The City shall have the authority
to increase or decrease commercial electric service deposits, based on
the usage, if it is determined necessary by order of the City Clerk-
Treasurer. If a commercial deposit is increased and the commercial
consumer neglects or refuses to pay the increase within 30 days,
service shall be discontinued by the procedure provided for in Chapter
370, Utilities, § 370-1.2.
C. All utility deposits heretofore or hereafter deposited with the City that
are not demanded by the depositor within four years after the
discontinuance of such electric service shall be deemed forfeited and
shall be transferred to the Electric Fund of the City.
A. The City will designate a point on the consumer's premises where
service will be delivered. All meters for electric service shall be
furnished, shall be set in place, and shall remain the property of the
City. All such supply wires shall be considered property of the City. It
shall be unlawful for any person to employ any scheme, device or
contrivance for the purpose of evading the proper service and
registration of any meter or to employ any scheme or device whereby
he may obtain current which does not pass through the meter furnished
him by the Electric Superintendent. Finding apparatus attached to the
power meter or any device in or near any meter which causes the same
to register incorrectly shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the
occupier of said premises, or of said consumer, to convert electric
current to his own use, which is hereby declared unlawful, and the
person convicted of violation of the same shall be punished as
hereinafter provided; and if it shall appear to the Electric
Superintendent that any light or power meter shall have been tapped or
tampered with, he is hereby empowered to install or cause to be
installed, at the consumer's expense, a special meter as specified by the
Electric Superintendent and accessible only to the Electric

12-2-1980 by Ord. No. 42-80; 8-3-1999 by Ord. No. 26-99181]
All electric current furnished hereafter to consumers by the electric
distribution system of the City shall be measured by meters, which are the
property of, furnished and set by the City. No person except an authorized
agent of the City shall be allowed to set meters or make connections to the
electric service of the distribution system of this City. The City will hereafter
furnish all necessary meters to consumers and will keep all meters clean
and in repair at the expense of the City. The owner of the premises where
a meter is located shall provide ready and convenient access to the meter
so that it may easily be examined and read by authorized agents of the City.
Any consumer of current from the electric distribution system of the City
may request the Light Commissioner to test any current meter or meters in
use which the consumer may have reason to believe are not registering the
correct amount of current. Such request shall be made at the Utility Office/
City Hall and such consumer shall deposit with said office the sum of $50
per meter to be tested by a firm qualified to test meters. If, upon test, the
meter is determined to be defective and does not register the amount of
current 2% or less, the meter shall be repaired at City expense and such
$50 so paid shall be refunded to the consumer. If, however, upon such test,
the meter is determined to perform and register the electric current with
an accuracy of 2% or less, then such $50 shall be retained by the City Light
Department as payment for the expense incurred by the test requested by
such consumer.

9-16-1980 by Ord. No. 24-80; 10-18-2005 by Ord. No. 50-05]
When for any reason an electric meter is not registering accurately the
amount of kilowatt hours, the consumer shall be charged for the electric
current during the time such meter is out of repair in a sum equal to the
charge for the amount during the corresponding period of the preceding
year; provided that if no basis for such comparison exists, or in the opinion
of the Electric Superintendent such basis is unfair, the consumer shall pay
such reasonable sum for the electricity during such period as the Electric
Superintendent or his agents. The consumer shall safeguard and
provide adequate protection of the property of the City, including
metering equipment located on the consumer's premises, and maintain
clear and safe access thereto at all reasonable times.180
B. Master metering shall be prohibited in new multifamily residential
buildings. Provisions for individual-tenant metering will be installed at
the time of construction so that if the use of the building changes from
the above criteria, the living units can be easily converted to individual
metering and billing in accordance with City standards.

A. The Electric Superintendent shall monthly examine and read, or have
examined and read under his supervision, all meters of consumers of
electric service from the electric distribution system of the City. The
employees of the Utility Office shall prepare and cause to be made bills
for collection from each consumer for the amounts of current consumed
since the last reading or examination of his meter or meters. The bills,
so prepared, shall be mailed to the customers on or about the first day
of the next month. For record-keeping purposes, bills shall be
considered delinquent if they are received by the Utility Office after the
close of business on the 15th day of the month.

§ 237-3.1. Determination of rates.
A. As a tariff of rates based on monthly consumption by each consumer of
current from the Electric Distribution System of the City, the following
schedule based on meter readings is established.
B. One meter shall be installed to service one user. If additional buildings
are required for a given user, they shall be interconnected by the

(1) The following formula is used to determine the power cost
adjustment charge when it is invoked. The PCA will be calculated to
the nearest one-tenth of a $1.00/MWh or $0.10/KWh.
(2) When unexpected increases in the cost of power or other
emergencies are estimated to be greater than a deviation of 10% in
FY power costs budgeted the PCA formula is:
PCA = (Total Estimated Cost Difference from Budget for
Application Period) divided by (Estimated kWh Sales for
Application Period)

§ 260-1.1. Adoption of Natural Gas Regulation Act. [Amended
12-15-1987 by Ord. No. 33-87205]
The provisions of the State Natural Gas Regulation Act (Neb. RS 66-1801 et
seq.) and any amendments made thereto, except as otherwise provided for
in this article, are hereby adopted by this reference thereto and made a part
of this article as fully as if set forth at length herein, except as otherwise
provided in this article.206
§ 260-1.2. Rate changes. [Amended 10-20-1987 by Ord. No. 26-87]
A. In the event the franchisee desires to change its rates for natural gas
service within the City other than to reflect an adjustment for the cost
of purchased gas, the franchisee will present to the City copies of
present and proposed rate schedules and information supporting the
proposed rates to be charged for natural gas service within the City.
The rate schedule and information submitted with the rate schedules
shall be referred to as the "rate filing." Any such rate filing shall be
deemed filed upon receipt of the same and the filing fee by the City
Clerk. A filing fee as set from time to time by the City Council shall be
paid to the City with the rate filing. Such fee shall be considered as an
operating cost of the franchisee and shall not be separately itemized on
any customer bill.207
B. The governing body of the City shall have the right to select and engage
rate consultants, accountants, auditors, attorneys, engineers and other
experts as deemed necessary or desirable to advise and represent the
governing body in evaluating any proposed rate change. The franchisee
shall reimburse the City within 90 days of the presentation of a bill by
the City for the reasonable costs of those services only to the extent that
said costs exceed the filing fee for the rate filing.
C. If the proposed rates sought by the franchisee in its rate filing have not
been passed on final reading by the City Council within 90 days after it
was filed, or as such time may be extended by agreement between the
franchisee and City in order to supply additional information if
requested by the City, the proposed rates shall be put into effect as
interim rates and shall be collected subject to refund pursuant to Neb.
RS 66-1838, as the same may be amended from time to time. Such
interim rates shall remain in effect pending final determination by the

amount not to exceed $500 for any one offense, recoverable with costs, and

City, which determination shall be made within one year or, in the event
of litigation, final rate determination by the courts.208
D. The rates proposed to be charged for non-contract firm natural gas
service within the City shall be based upon the utility's cost of providing
service to the City or the representative costs in that part of the utility's
service area which includes the City. The period for which the cost of
service is to be recognized is to be a projected twelve-month period
commencing not later than the proposed effective date of the increase.
The cost of service shall be determined in a manner consistent with
regulated public utility practices and shall include 1) appropriate costs
as defined and set forth in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Natural Gas Companies
FERC Accounts, and 2) a reasonable return on the utility's rate base.
E. In determining a reasonable return, a rate (percentage) shall be
employed that is representative of the cost of debt, preferred stock, and
common equity capital. The rate base shall consist of the applicable net
investment in utility plant (as defined in the FERC Accounts), allowance
for working capital, and such other items as may reasonably be
included; less such investment as may, unless otherwise prevented by
law, be attributed to other than investor capital.
F. The franchisee's appropriate costs and items of rate base shall include
allocated or apportioned expenses and rate base items, when such
allocations or apportionments are reasonably representative of
assigned common costs and arise from the manner in which the
franchisee's operations are conducted or from an avoidance of
excessive and costly financial recordkeeping.
G. Rate filings, not including changes reflecting the cost of gas, shall be
limited to a maximum of one in any twelve-calendar-month period.209

The municipality owns and operates the municipal sewer system through
the Water/Wastewater Superintendent. The governing body, for the purpose
of defraying the cost of the construction of the municipal sewer system, may
each year levy a tax not exceeding the maximum limit prescribed by state
law on the actual valuation of all real estate and personal property within
the corporate limits that is subject to taxation. The revenue from said tax
shall be known as the "Sewer Construction Fund." The Water/Wastewater
Superintendent shall have the direct management and control of the Water/
Wastewater Department and shall faithfully carry out the duties of his office.
He shall have the authority to adopt rules and regulations for the sanitary
and efficient management of the department, subject to the supervision and
review of the governing body. (Neb. RS 16-667 through 16-672, 16-249,

A. Every person or persons desiring sewer service must make application
therefor at the Utility Office located in City Hall. The application must
state truly and fully all uses to which said sewer service is to be applied
and no additional use will be allowed.
B. For new consumers, blanks will be furnished for that purpose by the
Utility Office. All landlords shall make an application with the City to
receive sewer service for their rental properties. This application shall
be signed one time only and shall place the responsibility for payment
of all usage on the landlord when any of his rental properties are not
rented. It shall be the duty of the landlord to notify the Utility Office of
any changes of sewer usage by tenants on his properties. If the landlord
wishes to assume the responsibility for payment of sewer service on any
of his rented or leased properties when they are rented, he must so
notify the Utility Office in writing upon blanks furnished for that
purpose. Upon receiving such notification, all bills will be mailed
directly to the landlord and he will be held responsible for their
payment. Otherwise, all requirements for service deposits must be met.
C. Applications for sewer service are not transferable. Any person wishing
to change from one location to another shall make a new application. If
any consumer shall sell, dispose of, or remove from the premises where
service is furnished in his name, or if the premises are destroyed by fire
or other casualty, he shall at once inform the Utility Office, which shall

cause the sewer service to be shut off from the premises. If the
consumer should fail to give such notice, he shall be charged for all
sewer service used on the premises until the Utility Office is otherwise
advised of such circumstances.
D. The municipality, through the Water/Wastewater Department, shall
furnish sewer services to persons within its corporate limits whose
premises abut a street or alley in which a commercial main is now or
may hereafter be laid. The municipality may also furnish sewer service
to persons whose premises are situated outside the corporate limits of
the municipality, as and when, according to law, the governing body
may see fit to do so.257
E. The rules, regulations, and sewer use rates hereinafter named in this
chapter shall be considered a part of every application hereafter made
for sewer service and shall be considered a part of the contract between
every consumer now or hereafter served. Without further formality, the
making of the application on the part of any applicant or the use of
sewer service by present consumers thereof shall constitute a contract
between the consumer and the municipality, to which said contract both
parties are bound. If the consumer shall violate any of the provisions of
said contract or any reasonable rules and regulations that the
governing body may hereafter adopt, the Utility Office shall cause the
sewer service to be shut off from the premises. If the consumer should
fail to give such notice, she shall be charged for all sewer use on the
premises until the Utility Office is otherwise advised of such
circumstances.258

[Amended 11-15-1977 by Ord. No. 1101]
§ 325-6.1. Unlawful use; prohibited discharges.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater,
surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, including
interior and exterior foundation drains, uncontaminated cooling water,
or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
B. Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm
sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent.
Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be
discharged, on approval of the Superintendent, to a storm sewer,
combined sewer, or natural outlet.279
C. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
(1) Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid, or gas.
(2) Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids,
or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment
process, constitute a hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage
treatment plant, including but not limited to cyanides in excess of
two mg/l as CN in the wastes as discharged to the public sewer.
(3) Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5, or having any
other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment, and personnel of the sewage works.
(4) Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference
with the proper operation of the sewage works, such as, but not
limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass,
rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood,
paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups,
milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
(5) Any waters or wastes having a five-day BOD greater than 300 parts
per million by weight, or containing more than 350 parts per
million by weight of suspended solids, or having an average daily
flow greater than 2% of the average sewage flow of the City, shall
be subject to the review of the Superintendent. Where necessary, in
the opinion of the Superintendent, the owner shall provide, at his

expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to
reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to 300 parts per million
by weight, or reduce the suspended solids to 350 parts per million
by weight, or control the quantities and rates of discharge of
such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications, and other pertinent
information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities
shall be submitted for the approval of the Superintendent, and
no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said
approvals are obtained in writing.280
D. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, that such wastes can harm either
the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse
effect on the receiving stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb,
public property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to
the acceptability of these wastes, the Superintendent will give
consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction
of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the
sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited
are:281
(1) Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 65° C.
(2) Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances
which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32°
F. and 150° F. (0° C. and 65° C.).
(3) Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation
and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor 3/4
horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Superintendent.
(4) Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes,
or concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not.
(5) Any water or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and
similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting any
excessive chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such

(7) Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration
as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
(8) Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
(9) Materials which exert or cause:
(a) Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues)
or dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride
or sodium sulfate).
(b) Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions).
(c) Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine
requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant
load on the sewage treatment works.
(d) Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined herein.
(10)Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements
of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
A. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances
or possess the characteristics enumerated under § 325-6.1 of this
article, and which, in the judgment of the Superintendent, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life to
constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
(1) Reject the wastes;
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

§ 325-6.3. Grease, oil and sand interceptors.283
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be located so as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
§ 325-6.4. Maintenance of flow-equalizing facilities.
Where preliminary treatment of flow-equalizing facilities are provided for
any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
§ 325-6.5. Control manhole.284
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in
the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole will be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
§ 325-6.6. Testing and measurement standards.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined
in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public
Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the
event no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall
be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer
to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall
be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of

the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of § 325-6.7 of this article.
B. If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, and subject
to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.

hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will
determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be
taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
§ 325-6.7. Special agreements.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may
be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern.
§ 325-6.8. Special conditions.
A. Where, in the judgment of the Council by reason of special conditions,
the application of the use charges hereinbefore set forth would be
inequitable or unfair to either the City or the user, or in the cases where
the character of the sewage from a consumer is such that an additional
burden is placed upon the sewerage system greater than that imposed
by the average sewage delivered to the sewage disposal plant, a special
rate may be established by contract or by resolution, duly passed and
approved by the Council. To assist the Council in determining whether
or not special conditions exist or additional burden is placed upon the
sewerage systems, the consumer shall, upon the request of the Council,
provide access to the owner's sewer lateral at a point where
representative samples may be taken. Strength from the character of
this waste shall be tested and it shall be determined to the satisfaction
of the Council, at the owner's expense, the strength of the waste and
any special characteristics the waste may have.
B. If any user can show to the satisfaction of the Council that any
substantial portion of the water consumed by the user as determined by
this section is used for such purpose that it does not contribute to the
sanitary sewerage, that water shall be disregarded for the purpose of
determining the sewer use charges to the user.

In addition to all other remedies, if a customer shall for any reason remain
indebted to the municipality for sewer service furnished, such amount due,
together with any rents and charges in arrears, shall be considered a
delinquent sewer rent which is hereby declared to be a lien upon the real
estate for which the same was furnished. Any delinquent sewer rentals
which remain unpaid for a period of three months after they become due
may be, by resolution of the Council, assessed against said real estate as
a special assessment, which special assessment shall be certified by the
Municipal Clerk to the County Clerk of Seward County, Nebraska. The
County Clerk shall thereupon place the same on the tax rolls for collection,
subject to the same penalties and to be collected in like manner as other
City taxes; provided that the City shall notify in writing nonoccupying
owners of premises or their agents whenever their tenants or lessees are
60 days' delinquent in the payment of sewer rent. Thereafter, if the owner

user shall be charged for the month or months in which the meter is
accurate, a sum equal to the charge for the amount of water used on
said premises during the corresponding period of the preceding year;
provided that if no basis for such comparison exists, or if the Water/
Wastewater Superintendent determines such basis is unfair to the
consumer, the consumer shall pay such reasonable sum for sewer use
during such period as the Water/Wastewater Superintendent shall
determine. In the event of any unusual circumstances causing a higher
water use than normal during the month in which residential rates are

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 329-1.1. Purpose and findings.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the inappropriate location and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market; neither is it
the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
B. Findings. Based on evidence concerning the advance secondary effects
of adult use on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases
of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v.
American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theater,
Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., TDA "Kandyland",

Winslow v. Sheets, 261 Neb. 203; 622 N.W.2d 595 (2001); Major
Liquors, Inc. v. City of Omaha, 188 Neb. 628, 198 N.W.2d 483 (1972);
and on studies on other communities, including, but not limited to,
Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Garden Grove, California; Los
Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Adams County, Colorado;
Denver, Colorado; Manatee County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Kansas City, Kansas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Las

Bellevue, Washington; Des Moines, Washington; Seattle, Washington;
St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and also on findings from the
Environmental Research Group to the American Center for Law and
Justice (March 31, 1996), the Council finds:
§ 329-1.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 329-1.1
1:497
(1) Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no
mechanism to make the owners of these establishments
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
(2) Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence
of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
(3) Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos,
or live sex shows.
(4) Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
(5) Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex
within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
(6) Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those
substantial governmental concerns.
(7) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a
licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see
that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent
with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as
well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of
the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
(8) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult theaters.
(9) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past
employees will help reduce the incidents of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential
witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in
such establishments.
(10) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
§ 329-1.1 SEWARD CODE § 329-1.1
1:498
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially
related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of
such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases.
(11) The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in
contravention of this chapter.
(12) The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(13) The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the
City will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

Municipal Property
§ 340-1.1. Definitions.
The following definitions shall be applied throughout this chapter. When no
definition is specified, the normal dictionary usage of the word shall apply.
SIDEWALK SPACE  That portion of a street between curblines and
adjacent property lines.
§ 340-1.2. Sale and conveyance. [Amended 11-17-1998 by Ord. No.
45-98; 3-20-2012 by Ord. No. 18-12]
A. The municipality may sell and convey any real estate or personal
property owned by the municipality, including park land, in such
manner and upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed in the
best interests of the municipality; except that real estate owned by the
municipality may be conveyed without consideration to the State of
Nebraska for state armory sites or, if acquired for state armory sites,
shall be conveyed in the manner strictly as provided in Neb. RS 18-1001
to 18-1006.
B. The power to sell and convey any real estate owned by the municipality,
including park land, except real estate used in the operation of public
utilities and except real estate for state armory sites for the use of the
State of Nebraska as expressly provided in Subsection A of this section,
shall be exercised by ordinance directing the conveyance of such real
estate and the manner and terms thereof. Notice of such sale and the
terms thereof shall be published for three consecutive weeks in a legal
newspaper published in or of general circulation in the municipality
immediately after the passage and publication of such ordinance.
C. If within 30 days after the passage and publication of such ordinance a
remonstrance against such sale is signed by registered voters of the
municipality equal in number to 30% of the registered voters of the
municipality voting at the last regular municipal election held therein
and is filed with the governing body, the property shall not then, nor
within one year thereafter, be sold. If the date for filing the
remonstrance falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the
signatures shall be collected within the thirty-day period, but the filing
shall be considered timely if filed or postmarked on or before the next
business day.
D. Upon the receipt of the remonstrance, the governing body, with the aid
and assistance of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, shall
determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the
remonstrance. The governing body shall deliver the remonstrance to
the Election Commissioner or County Clerk by hand carrier, by use of
law enforcement officials, or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Upon receipt of the remonstrance, the Election Commissioner or
§ 340-1.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 340-1.2
1:535
County Clerk shall issue to the governing body a written receipt that
the remonstrance is in the custody of the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
compare the signature of each person signing the remonstrance with
the voter registration records to determine if each signer was a
registered voter on or before the date on which the remonstrance was
filed with the governing body. The Election Commissioner or County
Clerk shall also compare the signer's printed name, street and number
or voting precinct, and municipal or post office address with the voter
registration records to determine whether the signer was a registered
voter. The signature and address shall be presumed to be valid only
if the Election Commissioner or County Clerk determines that the
printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and municipal
or post office address matches the registration records and that the
registration was received on or before the date on which the
remonstrance was filed with the governing body. The determinations
of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk may be rebutted by
any credible evidence which the governing body finds sufficient. The
express purpose of the comparison of names and addresses with the
voter registration records, in addition to helping to determine the
validity of the remonstrance, the sufficiency of the remonstrance, and
the qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud, deception,
and misrepresentation in the remonstrance process. Upon completion
of the comparison of names and addresses with the voter registration
records, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in
writing a certification under seal setting forth the name and address
of each signer found not to be a registered voter and the signature
page number and line number where the name is found, and if the
reason for the invalidity of the signature or address is other than the
non-registration of the signer, the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk shall set forth the reason for the invalidity of the signature. If
the Election Commissioner or County Clerk determines that a signer
has affixed his or her signature more than once to the remonstrance
and that only one person is registered by that name, the Election
Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
under seal setting forth the name for the duplicate signature and shall
count only the earliest dated signature. The Election Commissioner or
County Clerk shall certify to the governing body the number of valid
signatures necessary to constitute a valid remonstrance. The Election
Commissioner or County Clerk shall deliver the remonstrance and the
certifications to the governing body within 40 days after the receipt
of the remonstrance from the governing body. The delivery shall be by
hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified mail,
return receipt requested. Not more than 20 signatures on one signature
page shall be counted.
E. The governing body shall, within the 30 days after the receipt of the
remonstrance and certifications from the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk, hold a public hearing to review the remonstrance and
certifications and receive testimony regarding them. The governing

Trees and shrubs growing upon, or near, the lot line, or upon public ground,
and interfering with the use or construction of any public improvements
shall be deemed an obstruction under this article. Said trees, shrubs and
their roots may be removed by the municipality at the expense of the owner
of the property upon which the tree or shrub is located should the owner
fail or neglect, after notice, to do so. It shall be unlawful for any person,
persons, firm, or corporation to obstruct or encumber, by fences, gates,
buildings, structures, or otherwise, any of the streets, alleys, or sidewalks.
(Neb. RS 16-207)
body shall, following the hearing, vote on whether or not the
remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the remonstrance if sufficient
valid signatures have been received.
F. Subsections B through E shall not apply to the sale of real property if
the authorizing resolution directs the sale of real property having a
total fair market value of less than $5,000. Following passage of the
resolution directing the sale of the property, notice of the sale shall be
posted in three prominent places within the City for a period of not less
than seven days prior to the sale of the property. The notice shall give a
general description of the property offered for sale and state the terms
and conditions of sale. Confirmation of the sale by passage of an
ordinance may be required.307
G. The power of the municipality to convey any personal property owned
by it shall be exercised by resolution directing the sale and the manner
and terms of the sale. Following passage of the resolution directing the
sale of the property, notice of the sale shall be posted in three
prominent places within the City for a period of not less than seven days
prior to the sale of the property. If the fair market value of the property
is greater than $5,000, notice of the sale shall also be published once in
a legal newspaper published in or of general circulation in such City at
least seven days prior to the sale of the property. The notice shall give a
general description of the property offered for sale and state the terms
and conditions of sale.308
H. Personal property may be conveyed, notwithstanding the procedure in
Subsection G of this section, when:
(1) Such property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs; or
(2) Such property is being conveyed to another public agency

§ 340-1.4. Permitted obstructions.309
Persons engaged in the erection, construction, reconstruction, wrecking,
or repairing of any building, or the construction or repair of a sidewalk
along any street, may occupy the public street space with such building
material and equipment as long as is necessary if such persons shall make
application to and receive a permit in writing from the Street
Superintendent to do so; provided that no permit for the occupancy of the
sidewalk space, and more than 1/3 of the roadway of the public space
adjacent to the real estate on which said building is to be constructed,
erected, reconstructed, wrecked, or repaired, shall be granted; and
provided, further, that a suitable passageway for pedestrians shall be
maintained within the public space included in the permit, which shall be
protected and lighted in the manner required by the Street Superintendent.
§ 340-1.5. Weeds.310
It is hereby the duty of the Street Superintendent or his duly authorized
agent to view and inspect the sidewalk space within the corporate limits for
growing weeds during the growing season, and if rank and noxious weeds
are found growing thereon, he shall notify the owner or occupant thereof
to cut down such weeds as close to the ground as can be practicably done
and keep the weeds cut thereon in like manner during the growing season
for weeds. In the event that the owner of any lot or parcel of land within
the municipality is a nonresident of the municipality or cannot be found
therein, the notice may be given to any person having the care, custody,
or control of such lot or parcel of land. In the event that there can be
found no one within the municipality to whom notice can be given, it shall
be the duty of the Street Superintendent or his agent to post a copy of
the notice on the premises and then to cut or cause the weeds thereon to
be cut as therein provided and report the cost thereof in writing to the
governing body. The cost shall then be audited and paid by the municipality
and the amount thereof shall be assessed against the lot or parcel of land
as a special tax thereon and shall be collected as are other taxes of the
municipality or may be recovered by civil suit brought by the municipality
against the owner of the parcel of land. In the event the property owner
is a nonresident of the county in which the property lies, the municipality
shall, before levying any special assessment against that property, send a
copy of any notice required by law to be published by means of certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the nonresident
property owner. The last known address shall be that address listed on the
current tax rolls at the time such required notice was first published. (Neb.

§ 340-1.6. Awnings in sidewalk space.
All awnings hereafter erected or suffered to remain in the sidewalk space
shall be elevated at least seven feet at the lowest part from the top of the
public sidewalk and shall not project over said sidewalk to exceed 3/4 of
the width thereof. They shall be supported without posts by iron brackets
or by any iron framework attached firmly to the building, so as to leave
the sidewalk wholly unobstructed thereby; provided that nothing herein
shall be construed to prevent the owner of any building from constructing a
substantial awning or marquee of noncombustible material supported with
or without posts over the sidewalk space if located flush with the outer edge
thereof and if permission in writing shall have first been secured from the
Mayor and Council.
§ 340-1.7. Curb pumps and filling stations.
No curb pump or filling station used for the storage and sale of petroleum
products shall be constructed or suffered to remain within the limits of any
street between lot line and lot line. All such curb pumps or filling stations
now erected or hereafter constructed in the streets of the City are hereby
declared to be a nuisance and, regardless of any permit heretofore granted
by the Mayor and Council, the Mayor and Council are hereby empowered
at any time the public good demands to order the removal of such curb
pump or filling station. Before any curb pump or filling station now located
within the limits of any street shall be removed, the Chief of Police shall
serve a notice on the owner and tenant or user of such pump or station, if
there be any, to remove said pump or filling station beyond the limits of the
street. The Chief of Police shall not serve such order of removal until the
Council by resolution shall direct the same upon a vote of a majority of the
members of the Council. If the owner or lessee of said curb pump or filling
station shall refuse or neglect to comply with the notice of removal, then
the Chief of Police shall remove said obstruction from the street in which
it is situated, shall restore the street to a condition safe for public travel
thereon, shall notify the owner or lessee that the salvage from said curb
pump or filling station is located at a definite place within the corporate
limits at the expense or risk of said owner or lessee, shall report the expense
of such removal to the Mayor and Council, and, if the expense incident to
the removal thereof be approved by the Council, then a warrant shall be
drawn on the General Fund to reimburse the Chief of Police for the money
expended by him in abating said nuisance. The City shall thereupon recover
the sum so expended by civil suit brought against the owner or lessee of the
pump or filling station in any court of competent jurisdiction.

maintaining adequate clearance from trees and branches
approaching overhead primary, secondary and service electrical
lines. The City Street Department is similarly responsible for
ensuring that the City's streets, alleys and walkways are clear of
any trees, branches or shrubs which could obstruct the path or
sight distance of the motorist and/or pedestrian.
(2) The City of Seward is also cognizant of the fact that trees serve an
important aesthetic and energy-saving purpose for the residents of
§ 364-1.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 364-1.8
1:585
the City. It is therefore necessary to establish clear and specific
rules regulating how the trimming and/or removal of trees and
shrubs is to be implemented when necessary.
B. Notices to residents.
(1) When it is determined that a tree or shrub requires trimming or
removal, the City shall deliver or mail by means of certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the owner or tenant of the abutting or
affected property a notice advising him/her of the problem, the
approximate location, and the suggested remedy. In addition, the
notice shall advise the owner/tenant that he/she has 10 days in
which to contact the City if questions or objections concerning the
action exist; and that if no contact is made with City personnel
during this time, the City will proceed with the project as described
in the notice.
(2) The notice, as described above, shall apply to all cases, except
when an emergency exists or when it is necessary to remove a tree
or branches in order to restore electrical service or to open up a
street blocked by a tree or branch.
C. Removal of trees or shrubs. Trees shall be taken out only if the
following conditions exist:
(1) If the tree of concern is dead or affected by disease to the extent
that it could not survive on a long-term basis.
(2) If the tree or shrub of concern is located in such a position that it
cannot be trimmed properly to resolve the problem, without
ruining its aesthetic appearance.

back from the power line a minimum of 48 inches.
(2) Tree branches nearer to a street or sidewalk than the standards set
forth in § 364-1.6 of this article shall be trimmed back to a point
which meets these standards.
(3) Wherever feasible, branches shall not be stubbed in the middle of a
branch; rather, the branch shall be trimmed at that point where it
joins with a greater sized branch of the tree.
E. Removal of branches. Trees, branches and shrubs taken down by the
City shall be removed from the property as soon as is practical after
they have been felled. In no case shall the timber be left on the property
longer than five working days after the trimming took place.

any portion of such trees. The preceding restrictions do not apply to proper
planting, staking and guying practices.

F. Appeal of conflicts between City personnel and property owner or
tenant. If a property owner and/or tenant objects to the action proposed
by City personnel and efforts to mutually resolve the objection between
the parties involved fail, the City's Tree Board shall serve as a hearing
board to resolve the dispute. Appeal to the Tree Board shall be made in

alcohol content if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that
such person has alcohol in his or her body; or

content of 0.08 of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210
liters of his or her breath.
B. Any person who refuses to submit to such preliminary breath test shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person who refuses to submit to a
chemical blood, breath, or urine test as required above or who shall
operate or be in actual physical control of any motor vehicle while
under the influence of alcoholic liquor or of any drug or while in a
condition described in Subsection A of this section shall be deemed

cost of the materials, including the meter and any required City labor.
Each new deduct meter must be installed by a licensed plumber. The
master meter owner may not shut off water to deduct meters except for
maintenance or repairs, which must be done as expediently as possible.
If any water on the master meter is discharged to the sewer system,
then the master meter will be billed for water and sewer rates for its
size and class. The owner of the master meter must maintain all
plumbing in good repair and keep accurate records of layout of all pipes
and fixtures. All deduct meters must be accessible and installed in a
location to prevent freezing. All piping and fixtures must be protected
from freezing. The master and deduct meter accounts will be set up
similar to other accounts for billing purposes, except the usage

§ 390-1.8. Licensed plumber required.406
It shall be unlawful for any master or journeyman plumber to do any
work upon any of the pipes or appurtenances of the Water/Wastewater
Department, or to make any connection with, or extension of, the supply
pipes of any consumer taking water from the City until such master or
journeyman plumber shall have first procured a license and permit.407
§ 390-1.9. Inspection of plumbing.408
All plumbing shall be skillfully done, and in a manner required by the Water/
Wastewater Director, and shall be subject to his inspection and approval.
The quality and pattern of all appurtenances shall in like manner be subject
to his approval; and no work shall be covered until examined by him.
§ 390-1.10. Service pipe and stop box installation and repair.
[Amended 5-1-1979 by Ord. No. 1162; 6-20-2000 by Ord. No. 28-00]
A. All service pipes hereafter installed from the point of union with the
commercial main to the stop box of the consumer shall be of one inch in
diameter unless a larger tap is applied for, necessary or required, and of
such strength and quality as prescribed by the Water/Wastewater
Director; provided that if pipe of a larger diameter is necessarily
installed, the tap fee provided in this article shall be increased to cover
the service pipe of larger diameter furnished by the City. The City will
hereafter replace and keep in repair all service pipe from the
commercial main to and including the stop box. The consumer, at his or
her own expense, will replace and keep in repair all service pipe from
the stop box to, in, or upon his or her premises. When leaks occur in the
service and supply piping of the consumer between the stop box and
meter, the Water/Wastewater Director shall shut off the water service of
the consumer until the leak is repaired at the expense of the consumer
to the satisfaction of the Water/Wastewater Director. There shall be a
stop box and a stop and waste box installed in connection with each
water service. If any water service shall have no stop box installed in
connection therewith, the Water/Wastewater Director shall forthwith
cause it to be installed. Stop boxes hereafter installed shall be placed
uniformly at right angles with the commercial main and seven feet
outside the property line in the street running parallel with the
commercial main on the same side of the street to the property line it is
to serve. All stop boxes shall be uniformly placed five feet under
ground.409
B. There shall be a stop and waste box attached to every supply pipe at a
point in the building so as to admit water being shut off in frosty
weather and pipes being emptied.

§ 390-1.11. Service pipe excavations.410
In making excavations in the streets or highways for the laying of service
pipe or making repairs, the planks, paving stones, pavement, and earth
removed must be deposited in a manner that will occasion the least
inconvenience to the public and provide for a passage of water along the
gutters. Excavations in the streets shall be made only in accordance with
the provisions of this Code relating thereto. No person shall make any
excavation on any street or highway within 10 feet of any laid water pipe
while ground is frozen, or dig up or uncover so as to expose to the frost any
pipe or sewer of the City except under direction of the Water/Wastewater
Director.
§ 390-1.12. Refilling excavations and restoring pavement; no
openings when ground is frozen.411
After service pipes are laid, in refilling the opening the earth must be laid
in layers of not more than nine inches in depth, with each layer thoroughly
tamped and settled with water. The streets, sidewalks, and pavements must
be restored to as good a condition as previous to making the excavation, and
all dirt, stones and rubbish must be removed immediately after completing
the work. Should any excavation in any street, alley, or highway be left open
or unfinished for the space of 24 hours, or should the work be improperly
done or the rubbish not removed, the Water/Wastewater Director shall have
the right to finish or correct the work, and the expense incurred shall be
charged to the plumber or to the drainlayer and shall be paid by him before
the water is turned on. No opening of the streets for the tapping of mains
will be permitted when the ground is frozen except by permission of the
Water/Wastewater Director.
§ 390-1.13. Protection of excavations.
No person shall leave an excavation made in the street or highways open at
any time without barricades, and during the night warning lights must be
maintained at such excavation.
§ 390-1.14. Protection of service pipe; limitations on City liability.
C. All service pipe must be laid to prevent rupture by freezing.
A. All house boilers shall be constructed with one or more air holes near
the top of the inlet pipe, and sufficiently strong to bear the pressure of
the atmosphere under the vacuum. The stop box and other
appurtenances must be sufficiently strong to bear pressure and run off
the water in the mains. All persons taking the water shall keep their
own service pipes, stop boxes and apparatus in good repair and protect
them from frost or freezing at their risk and expense and shall prevent

all unnecessary waste of water; and it is hereby expressly stipulated
by the Council and Water/Wastewater Director that no claim shall be
made against them or either of them by reason of breaking of any
service box or, if from any cause the supply of water should fail, damage
arising from shutting off water to repair mains, making connections or
extensions, or for any other purpose that may be deemed necessary,
and the right is hereby reserved to cut off the supply of water at any
time, any permit to the contrary notwithstanding.412
B. No reduction in rates will be made for the time any service pipe may be
frozen or out of use from any cause.
A. All water service hereafter connected with the water plant and system
of the City shall have placed thereon a water meter, set in place by the
City. All such water meters shall remain the property of the City. No
person other than the Water/Wastewater Director, his assistants, or a
plumber under the direction of the Water/Wastewater Director shall be
allowed to set meters. All meters so set and installed will be kept in
repair at the expense of the City unless the damage done was caused by
the negligence or willful conduct or act of the consumer; provided that
when water meters get out of repair on account of the consumer's
negligence or willful conduct, the Water/Wastewater Director shall
repair or replace said meter and the total expense thereof shall be paid
for by the consumer. When such meters are entirely worn out, they will
be replaced by the City. Hereafter, all meters shall be sealed in three
places: once on the burr connections, on each side, and on the cover of
the registering dial; and no person shall deface, injure or break said
seal unless authorized to do so by the Water/Wastewater Director. All
water meters will be tested for accuracy on a regular basis and changed
or calibrated as required. In addition, at a consumer's request, a field
test of meter accuracy may be accomplished by the Water/Wastewater
Director. If, after the accomplishment of a field test indicating accuracy
of a consumer's meter, said consumer is not satisfied with the field
results, the consumer may pay a deposit to the City in an amount set
from time to time by the City Council and request that a meter test be
performed by an outside meter testing facility. If the test results
indicate accuracy within published American Water Works Association
(AWWA) standards, the deposit will be forfeited by the consumer to
defray the expenses of testing. If the test indicates inaccuracy
according to AWWA standards, the deposit will be returned to the
consumer and adjustments will be made to the last billing, if deemed
necessary by the Water/Wastewater Director.

12-15-1981 by Ord. No. 44-81; 8-3-1999 by Ord. No. 29-99414]
Water meters will be removed and service discontinued upon the request of
the consumer at no cost. If the same consumer at some future time requests
reinstallation of a meter to restore the same water service, a charge as
set from time to time by the City Council, payable in advance, will apply.
If a consumer requests a change in the meter size currently in place or
previously in place, a deposit in an amount set from time to time by the City
Council shall be paid by such consumer to defray the cost of installation
by the City for both parts and labor. The balance of the deposit, if any, will
be refunded to the consumer with an itemized statement of costs. Costs
in addition to the deposit will be billed after installation. If the Water/
Wastewater Director determines that extensive plumbing modification is
required, the consumer shall hire, at his own additional expense, a licensed
plumber to accomplish modifications prior to City installation of the meter.
§ 390-1.17. Meter location.415
All meter pits, if meters are not set in basements, shall be constructed by
an applicant or consumer at his own expense at such point near and inside
the lot line as shall be agreed upon by the City and consumer and shall
be of such design as sanctioned and approved by the Mayor and Council;
provided that all meters shall be set in a horizontal position so that the
same may be easily read by the Water/Wastewater Director, or his agents,
whether set in a meter pit or in a basement. The Water/Wastewater Director,
or his agent for reading meters, shall, whenever it is inconvenient to make
readings of any meter now set or hereafter to be set in meter pits or in
basements, be empowered to give the consumer 20 days' notice in writing
to reset said meter in a horizontal position, and if the consumer refuses or
neglects to do so, then the Water/Wastewater Director or his agent shall
reset said meter horizontally and the cost thereof shall be charged to and
paid by said consumer as water rent.
§ 390-1.18. Meter tampering prohibited.
It is hereby declared unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to tamper
with any water meter or by means of any contrivance or device to divert
the water from the service pipe so that the same will not pass through said
meter or while passing through said meter to cause the same to register
inaccurately.
B. The Water/Wastewater Director shall have the right to order a meter
applied to any service pipe whenever he may deem it advisable, and
collect meter rates for water. Meters shall be located on premises so
they will be conveniently accessible for inspection and reading strictly
in accordance with the provisions of this code.

§ 390-1.19. Separate stop boxes required.416
When a service pipe supplies two or more distinct premises or tenements,
there shall be provided, subject to the control of the Water/Wastewater
Director, a separate stop for each of such premises or tenements so the
water supply may be shut off from one without interfering with the supply
of the other.
§ 390-1.20. Turning water on.417
Water will not be turned into any house or private service pipe except on
order of the Water/Wastewater Director, or his duly authorized agent, and
plumbers are prohibited from turning the water into service pipe except on
permission of the Water/Wastewater Director or his duly authorized agent.
This rule shall not be construed to prevent any plumber from admitting
water to test the pipes, and for that purpose only.
§ 390-1.21. Waste and improper use of water.
All persons using water shall keep the fixtures using water closed except
when obtaining water for use, and shall be responsible for any damage or
injury that may result to others from the improper use of said water.
§ 390-1.22. Diversion of water prohibited.418
No consumer shall supply water to other families, or suffer them to take
water off his premises, nor, after water is introduced into any building or
upon any premises, shall any person make or employ any plumber or other
person to make any tap or connection with the pipe upon premises for
alteration, extension, or attachment without the permission of the Water/
Wastewater Director.
§ 390-1.23. Hydrants in streets; drinking fountains.
No hydrant, except for public drinking fountains, shall be placed within the
limits of any street, unless such hydrant is securely closed and protected
against general use. No drinking fountain which has openings by which it
can be used as a source of domestic supply shall be placed within the limits
of any street for public use.
§ 390-1.24. Right of entry for inspection. [Amended 4-3-2018 by

A. All water service customers of the City to whom water is supplied,
whether tenants, occupants or owners of premises, shall deposit at the
City Utility Office a utility deposit in such amount as may be fixed from
time to time by resolution of the Council. All such funds shall be

When for any reason a water meter is not registering accurately the volume
of water passing through it, the consumer shall be charged, for the month
or months in which the meter is inaccurate, a sum equal to the charge for
the preceding year; provided that if no basis for such comparison exists,
or in the opinion of the Water/Wastewater Director such basis is unfair, the
consumer shall pay such reasonable sum for the water rent during such
period as the Water/Wastewater Director shall fix. In no event shall either
the City be able make a claim for underpayment by the consumer or the

§ 390-2.2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AIR-GAP  The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere
between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a
tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of said vessel.
An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe,
A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is:
(1) To protect the public potable supply of the City of Seward,
Nebraska from the possibility of contamination or pollution by
isolating within the customer's internal distribution system(s) or by
the consumer's private water system(s) such contaminates or
pollutants which could backflow into the public water systems; and
(2) To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the consumer's in-plant potable water
system(s) and nonpotable water system(s), plumbing fixtures and
industrial piping systems; and
(3) To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively
prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
B. Responsibility. The Water/Wastewater Director shall be responsible for
the protection of the public potable water distribution system from
contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or
pollutants through the water service connections. If, in the judgment of
said Water/Wastewater Director, an approved backflow prevention
assembly is required (at the customer's water service connection; or
within the customer's private water system) for the safety of the water
system, the Water/Wastewater Director or his designated agent shall
give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved
backflow prevention assembly(s) at a specific location(s) on his
premises. The consumer shall immediately install such approved
assembly(s) at the consumer's own expense; and failure, refusal or
inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain
said assembly(s) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water
service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily
met.424

source other than its intended source, caused by the reduction of pressure
in the potable water supply system.
CONTAMINATION  An impairment of the quality of the potable water by
sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to
a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health
through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
CROSS-CONNECTION  Any physical connection or arrangement of piping
or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which
contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids
of questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may
occur into the potable water system. This would include any temporary
connections, such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug
valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over devices or
sliding multiport tubes.
CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL BY CONTAINMENT 
The installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly at the
water service connection to any customer's premises where it is
physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently
eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the
customer's water system; or

evaluation program resulting in an approval by a recognized and approved
testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. To be approved, these
assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance.
HAZARD, DEGREE OF  The term is derived from an evaluation of the
potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the
potable water system.
HAZARD, HEALTH  Any condition, device, or practice in the water supply
system and its operation which could create or in the judgment of the Water/
Wastewater Director may create a danger to the health and well-being of
the water consumer.426
HAZARD, PLUMBING  A plumbing-type cross-connection in a consumer's
potable water system that has not been properly protected by an approved
air-gap or approved backflow prevention assembly.
HAZARD, POLLUTIONAL  An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the
consumer's potable water system which would constitute a nuisance or
be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its
appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
HAZARD, SYSTEM  An actual or potential threat of severe damage to the
physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's
potable water system of a pollution or contamination which would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.

waters connected to an open cooling tower and/or cooling towers that
are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances;
contaminated natural waters such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers,
bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine,
paraffins, caustic and acid solutions and other liquid and gaseous fluids
used in industrial or other purposes or for fire-fighting purposes.
POLLUTION  The presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic,
or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute
a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree
which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does
adversely and unreasonably affect such waters or domestic use.
REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE ASSEMBLY  An assembly of two
independently acting approved check valves together with an hydraulically
operating, mechanically independent differential pressure relief valve
located between the check valves and at the same time below the first
check valve. The unit shall include properly located test cocks and tightly
closing shut-off valves at each end of the assembly. The entire assembly
shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by a
laboratory and a field-approved evaluation program resulting in an approval
by a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention
assemblies. The assembly shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone
between the two check valves at an acceptable level less than the pressure
on the public water supply side of the assembly. At cessation of a normal
flow, the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the
pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage
of either of the check valves, the differential relief valve shall operate to
maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by
discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per
square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be
approved, these assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line testing
and maintenance and be installed location where no part of the assembly
will be submerged.
WATER, NONPOTABLE  Water which is not safe for human consumption
or which is of questionable potability.
WATER, POTABLE  Any water which, according to recognized standards,
is safe for human consumption.
WATER SERVICE CONNECTION  The terminal end of a service
connection from the public potable water system; i.e., where the water
purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point
of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the
end of the service connection, then the "service connection" shall mean the
downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from
the service line ahead of any meter or any backflow prevention assembly
located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. "Service
connection" shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant
and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the
public potable water system.
§ 390-2.2 SEWARD CODE § 390-2.2
1:694
WATER, USED  Any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public
potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed
through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of
the water purveyor.
WATER/WASTEWATER DIRECTOR  The Director in charge of Water/
Wastewater Department of the City of Seward, who is invested with the
authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective crossconnection
control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of
this article.427
§ 390-2.3. Water system elements.
The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the utility
system and the customer system.
§ 390-2.4. Required cross-connection control.
A. The utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water
system under the complete control of the utility, up to the point where
the customer's system begins.
(1) The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in
the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the
distribution system.
(2) The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used
for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system.
B. The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond
the termination of the utility distribution system which are utilized in
conveying utility-delivered domestic water to points of use.
A. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected
as required by state laws and regulations and this Code. Service of
water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a
backflow prevention assembly required by this Code is not installed,
tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention
assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected crossconnection
exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.
B. The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the Water/Wastewater Director
to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary
hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a
condition becomes known, the Water/Wastewater Director shall deny or
immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a

physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the
conditions in conformance with the state and City statutes relating
to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto.428
A. In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or
may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the Water/Wastewater Director,
the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the
premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the
service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.429
B. In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an
actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system
shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an
approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate
to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process
waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been
subject to deterioration in quality.
C. In the case of premises having internal cross-connection that cannot be
permanently corrected or controlled, or intricate plumbing and piping
arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections
exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from
the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in
the service line.
A. The type of protective assembly required under § 390-2.5 shall depend
upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:
(1) In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply
as stated in § 390-2.5A and it is not subject to any of the following
rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved
air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly.

that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if
introduced into the public water system, the public water system
shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.
(3) In the case of any premises where there is material dangerous to
health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public water
system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an
approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist
include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations,
chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating
plants.
(4) In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" crossconnections,
either actual or potential, the public water system
shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an
approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly at the service connection.
(5) In the case of any premises where, because of security
requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible
or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey,
the public water system shall be protected against backflow from
the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an
approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly on each service to the premises.
B. Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and
size approved by the Water/Wastewater Director. The term "approved
backflow prevention assembly" shall mean an assembly that has been

ARTICLE 3
Use Types
§ 410-3.1. Purpose.
Article 3 shall be known as the "Use Types." The purpose of the use types
is to establish a classification system for land uses and a consistent set
of terms defining uses permitted or conditionally permitted within various
zoning districts. The use types article also provides a procedure for
determining the applicable use type of any activity not clearly within any
defined use type.
§ 410-3.2. Classification of uses; records.

Agricultural use types include the planting, cultivating, harvesting, and
storage of grains, hay, or plants commonly grown in Seward County; or the
raising and feeding of livestock or poultry.
A. Classification of uses. In the event of any question as to the appropriate
use types of any existing or proposed use or activity, the Zoning
Administrator of the City of Seward shall have the authority to
determine the appropriate use type. A determination of the Zoning
Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment. In making
such determinations, the Zoning Administrator and Board of
Adjustment shall consider such characteristics or specific requirements
of the use in common with those included as examples of use types.
Those examples, when included in use type descriptions, are intended
to be illustrative, as opposed to exclusive lists.

of appropriate use types in writing. The record of the determination
shall contain a report explaining the reasons for the determination.

§ 410-4.7. Interpretation of district boundaries.
The following rules shall apply in determining the boundaries of any zoning
district shown on the Zoning Map:
§ 410-4.8. Vacation of streets and alleys.

each side of such right-of-way shall be extended out to the former center
line.
§ 410-4.9. Annexation of territory.
All unimproved or agricultural territory that may hereafter be annexed
to the City shall be considered as lying in the AG Agricultural District
until such classification shall be changed as provided by this chapter. Any
improved property that is annexed into the City shall be zoned according to
the zoning district that most nearly describes either its present use or the
use proposed by Seward's Comprehensive Development Plan. This zoning
shall be established by the Planning Commission and the City Council at the
time of annexation.
damaged or destroyed, or for purposes of clarity due to a number of
boundary changes, or to correct drafting errors or omissions; provided,
however, that any such adoption shall not have the effect of amending
the original Unified Land Development Ordinance or any subsequent
amendment thereof.
A. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot
lines, such lot lines shall be considered the district boundaries.
B. Where district boundaries are indicated as within a street or alley,
railroad, streams or creeks, or other identifiable rights-of-way, the
center line of such rights-of-way shall be deemed the district boundary.
C. Where a district boundary divides a property, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the
Zoning Map.
D. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
corporate limits, such corporate limits shall be considered the district
boundaries.
E. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
section lines, quarter-section lines, or quarter-quarter-section lines,
such lines shall be considered the district boundaries.
F. Boundaries not capable of being determined as set forth in Subsections
A through E shall be as dimensioned on the Official Zoning Map or if not
dimensioned shall be determined by the scale shown on the map.
§ 410-4.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-4.10
1:761
§ 410-4.10. Required conformance.
Except as specified in this chapter, no building or structure shall be erected,
converted, enlarged, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall any
building or land be used, which does not comply with all of the district
regulations established by this chapter for the district in which the building
or land is located.
§ 410-4.11. Required frontage.
No lot shall contain any building used in whole or in part for residence
purposes unless such lot abuts for at least 20 feet on at least one public
street, or unless it has an exclusive unobstructed private easement of access
or right-of-way of at least 20 feet wide to a street; and there shall be not
more than one single-family dwelling for such frontage or easement, except
that a common easement of access at least 50 feet wide may be provided
for two or more such single-family dwellings or for one or more two-family
or multiple dwellings.
§ 410-4.12. Use Matrix; levels of permitted uses.
Within zoning districts in Seward, different uses are permitted with
different conditions. These are displayed in the Use Matrix.461 Levels of
permission include:
§ 410-4.13. Guide to site development regulators.
The regulators set forth in the tables in Articles 5 through 19 establish the
limits and requirements for most development in the City of Seward and its
A. Uses which are permitted by right. These uses are permitted subject to
issuance of a building permit by the Building Official, subject only to
compliance with all regulations of this chapter. Uses permitted by right
might be subject to supplemental regulations contained in this chapter.
These uses are indicated in the Use Matrix by a "P" in the applicable
cell.
B. Conditional uses. These uses are subject to approval of a conditional
use permit by the Planning Commission, following the procedure set
forth in § 410-44.3. These uses are indicated in the Use Matrix by an "S"
in the applicable cell.462
C. Site plan approval. Some use types require an additional site plan
approval by the Zoning Administrator/Building Official, based on
specific criteria for review. This procedure is set forth in § 410-44.2.
These uses are indicated in the Use Matrix by an asterisk (*) following
the citing of a specific use type.
461. Editor's Note: The Use Matrix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
462. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 410-4.10 SEWARD CODE § 410-4.13
1:762
extraterritorial jurisdiction. This section is intended to provide guidance for
applying the regulators contained in these tables.
A. Site area per housing unit. This indicates the gross land area per unit
within a residential development. For example, a forty-lot subdivision
on a ten-acre (435,600 square foot) tract will have a site area per unit of
10,890 square feet. Site area per unit, which measures gross density,
may differ from minimum lot size. In conservation development, the site
area per unit will be larger than minimum lot size, permitting the
clustering of lots in exchange for common open space. In multifamily
development, the site area per unit will usually be smaller than
minimum lot size, because the lot is the legal parcel on which a
multiple-unit building is built.
B. Minimum lot area. This indicates the minimum size of a legally
described and recorded parcel upon which development can take place.
As noted above, minimum lot area and site area per unit may not be the
same.
C. Minimum lot width. This is the required minimum distance connecting
at points along opposite side lot lines, measured at the required front
yard setback. For example, the lot width of an irregular lot in a district
requiring a twenty-five-foot front yard setback is determined by:
(1) Locating the points along each side lot line at a distance of 25 feet
back from the front property line.
(2) Drawing a line connecting these two points.
(3) Measuring the length of this line. The length is the lot width.
D. Minimum yards. These define the required setbacks of buildings from
front, side, and rear property lines. While the yard requirements apply
to a majority of development, this chapter provides for a number of
exceptions. Some of these include:
(1) Planned developments. Front yard setbacks can be varied within
planned developments, which are reviewed and approved by the
City Council after a recommendation from the Planning
Commission.
(2) Major streets. The City may require greater than normal setbacks
along segments of the City's arterial street system, as defined in
the Comprehensive Development Plan.
(3) Flexibility provided by supplemental development regulations.
Article 32 establishes supplemental regulations, many of which
provide flexibility or variations in setback regulations for specific
contexts.
(4) Maximum setbacks. Some specific zoning districts provide
maximum as well as minimum setbacks. These setbacks establish

1:763
"build-to" lines that may be necessary to protect the appearance
and character of special urban districts.
E. Maximum height. Height normally measures the vertical distance from
the established grade to the highest point of a building. However, as
established by the definition of "height,"463 the point of measurement
may vary for different types of buildings and roof slopes.
F. Maximum building coverage. This measures the percentage of a site
that may be covered by the footprint of buildings. Thus, a 20,000 square
foot building on a 40,000 square foot site has a building coverage of
50%. This is a method of regulating the scale of buildings in an area.
G. Maximum impervious coverage. This measures the percentage of a site
that may be covered by buildings and other surfaces and development
features which prevent the penetration of water into the ground (such
as driveways, porches, parking lots, and other features). Limits on
impervious coverage help control the velocity and quantity of
stormwater runoff and provide for groundwater recharge.
H. Floor area ratio. Just as site area per unit controls the density of
residential development, floor area ratio (FAR) controls the density of
nonresidential development. FAR is the ratio of gross floor area of a
building to total site area. Thus, in an area with a maximum permitted
FAR of 1.0, a 40,000 square foot building may be located on a 40,000
square foot site. Naturally, because of coverage ratios, landscaping, and
parking requirements, such a building will be multi-story.
I. Maximum amount of total parking located in street yard. This controls
the maximum amount of parking that can be located in the area
between a building facade and the street. When applied in certain
zoning districts, it is intended to reduce the number of cars seen from
the street, encourage site planning which locates parking in rear and
side yards, and produce a stronger relationship between buildings and
streets. For example, a project with 100 parking stalls and a fiftypercent
limit on the amount of parking located in street yards must
locate 50 of its stalls in rear or side yards without street exposure.
J. Minimum depth of landscaping adjacent to street rights-of-way. This
establishes the depth of landscaping that must be provided on private
property adjacent and in from the right-of-way line. Thus, if the
required minimum depth is 15 feet, a project must landscape the first
15 feet of its site back from the right-of-way line. All landscaping must
be done in accordance with Article 33, establishing landscaping
standards.
K. Minimum bufferyard requirements. This establishes the depth of a
bufferyard that must be provided by intensive land uses adjacent to
primarily residential land uses in residential zoning districts. All

landscaping must be done in accordance with Article 33, establishing
landscaping standards.
L. Supplemental use regulations. Certain permitted uses require
satisfaction of specific requirements in order to function successfully in
their urban or rural contexts. These supplemental requirements are set
forth in Article 31. These requirements are cross-referenced in the
"Supplemental Regulations" column of the Use Matrix.464

AG Agricultural District
§ 410-5.1. Purpose.
The AG District provides for and preserves the agricultural and rural use of
land, while accommodating extremely low-density residential development
generally associated with agricultural uses. This district is designed to
maintain permanent and comprehensive agricultural uses within the
Seward extraterritorial jurisdiction. It recognizes that major agriculture
has industrial aspects and negative effects on nearby neighborhoods that
often create conflicts between agricultural and residential uses. In addition,
land included in the Urban Reserve in the Comprehensive Plan should
be retained in the AG District to prevent premature or inappropriate
development.

and 100 feet from any public right-of-way or easement.
B. Animal waste holding facilities. All animal waste holding facilities shall
meet the current minimum requirements of the Nebraska Department
of Environmental Quality, Title 130, Chapter 10, Livestock Waste
Control Facilities. Approval of any such facility shall be subject to the
conditional permit use approval process. The facility shall meet at least
the minimum setback and separation standards for waste lagoons. The

RR Rural Residential District
[Amended 6-5-2007 by Ord. No. 9-07]
§ 410-6.1. Purpose.
The RR District provides for the rural residential use of land,
accommodating agriculture and very-low-density residential environments.
It is designed for permanent development of relatively remote areas that
are beyond the reach of Seward's foreseeable urban development pattern,
making eventual extension of urban services extremely unlikely. RR
Districts do not permit comprehensive agriculture, and are intended for
areas where farming is not a primary, permanent land use. Subdivisions
in RR Districts generally will be developed to rural standards, with gravel
roads, surface drainage, and individual water and wastewater management
systems. In parts of the Seward jurisdiction with distinctive landforms,
conservation development design is required to maintain the character
of the land. These areas are designated by the RC Rural Conservation
Development Overlay District and are subject to special standards and
planning procedures set forth in Article 27 of the Unified Land Development
Ordinance. These standards encourage the preservation of important open
space resources without reducing the density permitted the developer or
property owner.

Note 1: Rural Preservation Development (RPD)
The purpose of this regulator exception is to permit the creative design of
alternate living areas, as distinguished from subdivisions of standard lot
sizes and standard street systems with the intention of preserving the rural
character of the agricultural land use, including open fields, pastures, and
natural wooded areas.
The Planning Commission and City Council may permit the site area per
housing unit utilizing the designated regulator of three acres per housing
unit, provided that there is sufficient evidence and facts showing that the
proposed Rural Preservation Development meets the following conditions:
1. That the surrounding tracts for the proposed Rural Preservation
Development will not be adversely affected;
2. That the proposed Rural Preservation Development is consistent with
the intent and purpose of this section;
3. That the average allocated site area housing unit within the Rural
Preservation Development will not be less than the minimum site area
housing unit per parcel required in the Rural Residential District in
which the parcels of the proposed Rural Preservation Development
is located, except that the land appropriation will meet the following
criteria:
a. Each individual parcel plotted for sale must have an allocated
equivalence of five total acres, with three of the acres being retained
to the site area facilitating the residence for private ownership. The
remaining two acres shall be designated as permanent undivided
open space;
b. All undivided land including any lot capable of further subdivision
shall be designated as permanent open space and shall be restricted
from further subdivision and protected through a conservation
easement, or a restrictive protective covenant presented in a form
acceptable to the City and duly recorded in the Seward County
Register of Deeds Office. In the event that the City's growth extends
to a point where the designated open area tract of land becomes
contiguous or adjacent to the City limits, the controlling ownership
of said land may appeal to the City Council for the repeal of the
protected easement for further subdivision;
§ 410-6.2 SEWARD CODE § 410-6.2
1:770
4. Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest
practicable number of lots within a Rural Preservation Subdivision. To
achieve this, the majority of the house lots should abut undivided open
space in order to provide direct views and access.
Note 2: Rural Community District (RCD)
The purpose of this regulator exception is to produce a more attractive and
functional rural neighborhood and permit more usable open space, protect
build-through land for future annexation, and protect the environmental
features by preserving the rural character of the agricultural land use.
The Planning Commission and City Council may permit the site area per
housing unit utilizing the designated regulator of 1.5 acre lots per housing
unit, provided that there is sufficient evidence and facts showing that the
proposed Rural Community District meets the following conditions:
1. That the surrounding tracts for the proposed Rural Community District
will not be adversely affected;
2. That the proposed Rural Community District is consistent with the
intent and purpose of this section;
3. That the average allocated site area housing unit within the Rural
Community District will not be less than the minimum site area housing
unit per parcel required in the Rural Residential District in which the
parcels of the proposed Rural Community District is located, except that
the land appropriation will meet the following criteria:
a. Each individual parcel plotted for sale must have an allocated
equivalence of five total acres, with 1.5 of the acres being retained
to the lot site area facilitating the residence for private ownership.
The remaining 3.5 acres shall be designated as permanent undivided
open space;
b. All undivided land including any lot capable of further subdivision
shall be designated as permanent open space and shall be restricted
from further subdivision and protected through a conservation
easement, a restrictive protective covenant presented in a form
acceptable to the City and duly recorded in the Seward County
Register of Deeds Office. In the event that the City's growth extends
to a point where the designated open area tract of land becomes
contiguous or adjacent to the City limits, the controlling ownership
of said land may appeal to the City Council for the repeal of the
protected easement for further subdivision;
4. Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest
practicable number of lots within a Rural Preservation Subdivision. To
achieve this, the majority of the house lots should abut undivided open
space in order to provide direct views and access;
§ 410-6.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-6.2
1:771
5. The proposed method of providing sanitary sewer service to the area
shall be a public or community sewage system that complies with any
and all of the regulations set forth by the regulating state agency.
Therefore, the developer shall indicate the size and location of all
proposed sanitary sewers, manhole locations, and sewage treatment
facility shown on the plot documents;
6. The proposed method of providing an adequate water supply shall be
public or community water system or rural water district, that complies
with any and all of the regulations set forth by the regulating state
agency. Therefore, the developer shall indicate the size and location of
the proposed water mains, hydrants and the location of the community
well, including the type of water treatment to be used on the plot
documents.
Note:
Floodway - This land is not considered buildable due to flood zone
regulations. Therefore, since there is no preservation being deemed from
this regulator it should not be allowed to be calculated for use as open land.
Floodplain - This land could be considered as buildable if the floor level
is one foot above the base flood elevation (BFE). This would provide an
element of land preservation as detailed in the regulators. Therefore, it
should be allowed to be calculated into the open land designation.

R-1 Urban Residential Single-Family District (Low-Density)
§ 410-7.1. Purpose.
The R-1 District is intended to provide for urban residential development,
with gross densities generally below six units per acre. These areas
generally include single-family detached and attached dwellings on
relatively large lots with supporting community facilities and urban
services, including City water and sanitary sewer service. The R-1 District
may also be used as a "holding zone" prior to subdivision for areas
designated in the Comprehensive Plan for residential development. The use
of the R-1 District for development using wells and individual septic systems
should be discouraged, although it is not prohibited.

UC Urban Corridor Mixed Use District
§ 410-12.1. Purpose.
The UC District recognizes the mixed-use character of major urban
corridors, including traditional arterials such as 6th Street and Main Street,
as well as emerging mixed-use corridors. These corridors sometimes
accommodate a combination of residential, commercial, and office uses.
In many cases, these streets were traditional residential corridors, and
include houses that are converting to nonresidential use. Design standards
maintain their character as important urban streets. Some uses in the UC
District will require development above normal standards in order to assure
compatibility with surrounding uses.

C-1 Community Commercial/Mixed Use District
§ 410-13.1. Purpose.467
The C-1 District accommodates commercial and office facilities that serve
the needs of markets ranging from several neighborhoods to the overall
region. While allowed commercial and office uses are generally compatible
with nearby residential areas, traffic and operating characteristics of some
uses may have an impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods. Use
regulations require conditional permit review for these selected uses. C-1
Districts are most appropriate at intersections of collector and arterial
streets, at the junction of several neighborhoods, along major commercial
or mixed-use corridors, or at substantial commercial subcenters. The
district also permits other uses with similar urban impacts to substantial
commercial development.

C-2 Highway Commercial District
§ 410-14.1. Purpose.469
The C-2 District accommodates a variety of commercial uses, some of
which have significant traffic or visual effects. These districts may include
commercial uses that are oriented to services, including automotive
services, rather than retail activities. These uses may create land use
conflicts with adjacent residential areas, requiring provision of adequate
buffering. This district is most appropriately located along major arterial
streets, along major highway corridors characterized by large-scale uses
and traveler services such as Highway 15 south of Seward, or in areas
that can be adequately buffered from residential districts. The district
permits residential uses by conditional use permit, requiring such uses to be
reviewed for compatibility with primary commercial uses in busy corridors.

U/MU University Mixed Use District
§ 410-22.1. Purpose.
The U/MU University Mixed Use District is based on an understanding
that a college campus is a special kind of planned district, for which the
requirements of traditional zoning districts may be inappropriate or difficult
to apply. It provides an opportunity by which an official campus master plan
may be prepared and adopted as the development plan for a specific area
of the City. This relieves the university from receiving approval for each
project that is consistent with the overall adopted master plan.
§ 410-22.2. Permitted uses.
The U/MU District permits college and university use, including all facilities
and services that are auxiliary to campus use. Permitted auxiliary uses
includes residential development, commercial services, including retail and
food services that serve the campus community, maintenance facilities, and
any other use included within an official campus master plan.
§ 410-22.3. Site development regulations.
A. The minimum area of any U/MU District is 20 acres.
B. The City Council, following a recommendation by the Planning
Commission, may approve an official campus master plan as part of the
U/MU District designation. The campus master plan shall include at a
minimum:
(1) A conceptual site layout, including the location of proposed
buildings, parking, open space, and other facilities.
(2) General location, capacity, and conceptual design of parking
facilities.
(3) Description of all use types to be included in the project or area,
and maximum floor area devoted to each general use.
(4) Schematic location and design of campus open spaces and greens
on the site, including a landscaping plan.
(5) Vehicular and pedestrian circulation plan, including relationship to
external transportation systems.
(6) Proposed sewer, utility, and other infrastructure improvements.
(7) Proposed development regulations, including height limitations,
perimeter setbacks, and impervious coverage limitations.
(8) The range of flexibility and variation requested to maintain
consistency with the master plan.

The Zoning Administrator is authorized at his/her discretion to approve
amendments to an approved development plan, provided that:
(9) Relevant design or architectural standards included in the master
plan.
A. The Planning Commission and City Council shall review and evaluate
the campus master plan and the U/MU application. The City may
impose reasonable additional conditions, as deemed necessary to
ensure that the campus master plan shall be compatible with adjacent
land uses, will not overburden public services and facilities and will not
be detrimental to public health, safety and welfare.
B. The Planning Commission, after proper notice, shall hold a public
hearing and act upon each application.
C. The Planning Commission may recommend amendments to U/MU
District applications.
D. The recommendation of the Planning Commission shall be transmitted
to the City Council for final action.

become a part of the ordinance creating or amending the U/MU
District. All approved plans shall be filed with the City Clerk.
A. A written request is filed with the Zoning Administrator, along with
information specifying the exact nature of the proposed amendment.
B. The amendment is consistent with the provisions of this section.
C. The amendment does not alter the approved site regulations of the
development plan and does not materially alter other aspects of the
plan, including traffic circulation, mixture of use types, and physical
design; or does not increase density, floor area ratios.

C/OS Conservation and Open Space District
§ 410-23.1. Purpose.
The C/OS District accommodates Seward's policy of retaining large areas
of environmental importance for conservation and recreational purposes.
These include large purchases along the Plum Creek and Blue River
corridors and major areas of passive recreation, such as Wilderness Park.
These natural resource areas, recognized by the City's Comprehensive
Development Plan, are not appropriately described by traditional base
zoning districts.
§ 410-23.2. Property ownership.
All land within C/OS Districts shall be owned by the City of Seward, another
public agency, or a nonprofit organization or corporation whose primary
purpose is resource conservation. The C/OS District is not ordinarily
intended to apply to other private property and is not intended to restrict
the development rights of private property owners.
§ 410-23.3. Permitted uses.470
Land within C/OS Districts may be used for low-impact purposes associated
with open space and recreation. Permitted uses include horticulture, crop
production, cultural services, parks and recreation. Recreational clubs that
include primarily outdoor uses may be permitted following approval of a
conditional use permit.
§ 410-23.4. Site development regulations.
Because of the primary open space character of the C/OS District, site
development regulations that apply to development districts do not apply.

PUD Planned Unit Development District
§ 410-25.1. Purpose.
The PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District is intended to provide
flexibility in the design of planned projects; to permit innovation in project
design that incorporates open space and other amenities; and to ensure
compatibility of developments with the surrounding urban environment.
Planned unit developments often involve groupings of buildings or sites
that are designed as an integrated unit on land under unified control
or ownership at the time of grant of development permission. The
requirements of a PUD run with the land regardless of the subsequent sale
or conveyance of property The PUD District may be used in combination
with any base district specified in this chapter. The PUD District, which
is adopted by the City Council with the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, assures specific development standards for each designated
project.
§ 410-25.2. Permitted uses.
Uses permitted in a PUD Overlay District are those permitted in the
underlying base district. A PUD also may be combined with an MU Mixed
Use District to allow a combination of use types not anticipated by
conventional base districts.
§ 410-25.3. Objectives.
In evaluating applications for PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay
Districts, the Planning Commission and City Council shall consider the
following general objectives:
A. Residential PUD Districts. Residential PUD Districts should be designed
to produce more usable open space, provide better recreation
opportunities, enhance pedestrian scale, protect or create
neighborhood amenities and environmental features, and produce more
attractive neighborhoods than those produced by conventional
development techniques.
B. Commercial PUD Districts. Commercial PUD Districts should be
designed to produce more attractive and functional clusters and
commercial centers than the strip development that is frequently
produced by the application of conventional zoning regulations.
Techniques encouraged by PUD Districts include consolidated access,
shared parking, consistent architectural quality, improved pedestrian
and trail access to commercial facilities, public space, and integrated
landscaping and signage programs.
C. Industrial PUD Districts. Industrial PUD Districts should promote the
establishment of industrial parks and encourage groups of industrial

§ 410-25.4. Site development regulations.
Site development regulations are developed individually for each Planned
Unit Development District, but must comply with the minimum or maximum
standards established for the base district. Base district regulations provide
flexibility, including higher densities, within Planned Unit Development
Districts.
§ 410-25.5. Access to public streets.
Each PUD District must abut a public street for at least 100 feet and gain
access from that street.
§ 410-25.6. Application process.
buildings with integrated site design and architectural and landscaping
themes.
D. Mixed-use PUD Districts. Mixed-use PUD Districts should promote the
objectives of innovative design of their individual uses and encourage
creative groupings of different but complementary uses to establish
high-quality urban environments. Mixed-use PUD Districts may
encourage co-location of living and working areas, or activity centers
that incorporate a variety of uses.
E. PUD Districts in sensitive contexts. PUD Districts may be utilized to
provide a high level of detail and define the requirements of project
approval for developments proposed within settings that are so
sensitive that normal zoning requirements, including landscaping and
buffering requirements, do not provide sufficient protection for
neighboring properties.
A. Development plan. The application for a Planned Development District
shall include a development plan containing the following information
indicated in this section.
B. Application requirements. An application for approval must contain at a
minimum the following information:
(1) A detailed site map, including:
(a) A boundary survey.
(b) Site dimensions.
(c) Contour lines at no greater than two-foot intervals.
(d) Adjacent public rights-of-way, transportation routes, and
pedestrian or bicycle systems.

TND Traditional Neighborhood Design District
§ 410-26.1. Purpose.
The TND Traditional Neighborhood Design District is intended to
encourage innovative mixed-use residential environments that reflect the
planning and development patterns in place when Seward was initially
developed. The TND District produces environments which manage
automobiles but maintain a scale and set of linkages that promote
pedestrian travel and civic space. These theories of urban design have
been classified as "New Urbanism," although they transport the patterns of
development of traditional Seward into new settings. The TND regulations
included in this article are intended to capture the essence of this design
technique, while avoiding excessive requirements that will discourage the
use of the concept. The Seward regulations are intended to capture the
general concept and vision of traditional neighborhood design, without
being so prescriptive as to inhibit the use of the concept or discourage
design flexibility.
§ 410-26.2. Size.
The minimum size of a TND District shall be 10 acres.
§ 410-26.3. Application process.
§ 410-26.4. Permitted uses.
A. The application and adoption process shall be the same as those
established by PUD Planned Unit Development Districts.
B. All applications for a TND subdivision must be accompanied by a TND
development plan, in addition to other documents required by this
chapter. This plan shall illustrate the distribution of land uses
throughout the subdivision; the location and design of public spaces,
streets, and alleys; the location and nature of special design features;
architectural controls; and other information necessary to
communicate the concept of the TND subdivision. The TND subdivision
plan shall be a part of the approved subdivision. Subsequent building
and development permits shall be issued by the City only in consistency
with the TND development plan.
C. Articles of Incorporation and/or covenants for a homeowners'
association or other provision assuring maintenance or operation of all
common spaces shall be submitted with the TND application.
A. Mixed land uses.
(1) Retail, service, civic, office, and various types of residential land
uses may be combined within a TND development, notwithstanding
the use regulations of the underlying zoning district. The

distribution and location of land uses shall be consistent with the
TND plan submitted for the subdivision.
(2) The gross floor area of commercial area permitted within a TND
shall not exceed 10,000 square feet per 100 people projected to live
in the development. For the purpose of calculating projected
population, the following factors shall be used:
(a) Single-family detached: 3.5 people per unit.
(b) Single-family attached: 2.75 people per unit.
(c) Townhouses: 2.5 people per unit.
(d) Multifamily: 2.0 people per unit.
(3) Parks and public open spaces shall make up at least 10% of the
total area of the TND development.
A. The average site area per unit of a TND shall be established by the
underlying zoning district. However, the density of individual parts of
the TND may exceed the average density.
B. Overall density permitted by the underlying zoning district of the TND
may be increased as follows for specific amenities: 10% for the
provision of a centrally located town square of at least one acre for each
25 acres of developed area; 10% for the provision of approved
ornamental lighting throughout the TND subdivision; and 10% for the
development of a central community boulevard. Cumulative density
bonuses shall not exceed 25% of the density permitted by the
underlying zoning district.
A. Lot dimensions. Individual lot size dimensions, including minimum
width, may be reduced to 75% of the requirement of the underlying
zoning district. Any savings on lot size shall be devoted to public space,
including but not limited to town squares, small parks, greenways, and
community facilities.
B. Lot setbacks.
(1) Lot setbacks may be varied from those otherwise specified for the
zoning district. Typically, the front yard setback should respect a
build-to line that is not less than five feet nor greater than 20 feet.
Different setbacks may be incorporated as part of the TND District
approval. Setback limits must be established on the preliminary
and final plat.
§ 410-26.4 SEWARD CODE § 410-26.6
1:828
§ 410-26.7. Street system design.
(2) The distance across a street from building face to building face
shall not exceed 100 feet except along a community street or
boulevard.
(3) The setback from any garage entrance to any circulation way,
including an alley, must be at least 20 feet unless the project design
makes other specific provisions for dedicated off-street parking.
Garage access from the rear of lots by way of an alley is
encouraged.
A. Street continuity. All streets within a TND District connect to other
streets within the district, forming a continuous network. All streets
and alleys shall terminate at other streets within the TND District and
shall connect to other streets on the edge of the district.
B. Street and block characteristics.
(1) The design of the street system shall create an open network that
creates blocks with a length of no more than 660 feet.
(2) Street loops and culs-de-sac may be included as part of the street
system design. However, no street with a single point of access
onto a connecting street should be longer than 200 feet.
(3) Street or right-of-way widths may be varied for local streets within
TND subdivisions as provided in Article 40, Circulation System
Design.
C. Pedestrian system. Each project within a TND District shall include a
complete pedestrian system, providing access to all residential lots or
sites and major activity centers within the project. In addition, each
project shall provide direct access to any public multiuse recreational
trails that run through or are adjacent to the project site.
D. Community streets and boulevards. Community streets and boulevards
are streets that are designed as central open space features within a
TND development. The incorporation of these facilities within a TND is
strongly encouraged and receives a density bonus, as provided in
§ 410-26.5. Characteristics of such a street include:
(1) Alignment that generally runs more than 50% of the longest
dimension of the development.
(2) Orientation to a main activity center in the development, including
parks and neighborhood greens, civic facilities, commercial activity
centers, or designed landmarks.
(3) Extensive street landscaping and parallel sidewalks and trails.
(4) Thematic lighting and street furniture.
§ 410-26.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-26.7

RC Rural Conservation Development Overlay District
§ 410-27.1. Purpose.
The RC Rural Conservation Development Overlay District is intended to
require development design standards and techniques in sensitive
environmental areas around Seward that preserve unique landforms and
the character of land. The techniques of the RC District require that the
natural landforms determine the design and character of new residential
development in these sensitive areas. Areas of environmental sensitivity and
potential application of the RC Overlay District may be established by the
City's Comprehensive Development Plan.
§ 410-27.2. Process.472
Subdivisions in an RC Overlay District generally follow the approval
procedures outlined in Article 44, establishing the process for preliminary
and final plat approval. Projects which do not require subdivision follow
approval procedures appropriate to the specific project, including
conditional use permits, zoning amendments, site plan review, or other
applicable measures. The requirements and standards included in this
article are in addition to those established procedures.
§ 410-27.3. Permitted uses.
Land uses permitted in an RC District are the same as those permitted in
the underlying base district.
§ 410-27.4. Permitted density yield.473
Developments in RC Overlay Districts are permitted the same density on
developable area as would be allowed to conventional residential
development in the underlying zoning district. Yield in housing units (Y) is
calculated by the formula:
Y =
0.90(TA - UA)

B. The above areas shall generally be designated as undivided open space,
to facilitate easement monitoring and enforcement, and to promote
appropriate management by a single entity according to approved land
management standards.
C. All undivided open space and any lot capable of further subdivision
shall be restricted from further subdivision through a permanent
conservation easement, in a form acceptable to the City and duly
recorded in the Seward County Register of Deeds' office.
D. The required open space may be used, without restriction, for
underground drainage fields for individual or community septic
systems, and for "spray fields" for spray irrigation purposes in a "land
treatment" sewage disposal system. However, "mound" systems
protruding above grade and aerated sewage treatment ponds shall be
limited to no more than 10% of the required minimum open space.
E. Stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of
the minimum required open space, as may land within the rights-of-way
for underground pipelines. However, land within the rights-of-way of
high-tension power lines shall not be included as comprising part of the
minimum required open space.
A. The location of open space shall be consistent with the policies
contained in the City of Seward's Comprehensive Development Plan,
§ 410-27.4 SEWARD CODE § 410-27.6
1:832
and with the recommendations contained in this section and the
following section ("evaluation criteria").
B. Open space shall be comprised of two types of land: "primary
conservation areas" and "secondary conservation areas." All lands
within both primary and secondary conservation areas shall be
protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting future
development, and setting other standards safeguarding the site's
special resources from negative changes.
(1) Primary conservation areas. This category consists of wetlands
designated by the National Wetlands Survey, Water of the United
States, slopes exceeding 20%, floodways, and soils subject to
slumping, as indicated on the medium intensity maps contained in
the county soil survey published by the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service.
(2) Secondary conservation areas. Secondary conservation areas
comprise at least 35% of the net developable area and shall be
designated and permanently protected. Full density credit shall be
allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable
under local, state, and federal regulations, so that their
development potential is not reduced by this designation. Such
density credit may be applied to other unconstrained parts of the
site. Secondary conservation areas are determined by specific
project design and typically include all or some of the following
kinds of resources:
(a) A one-hundred-foot-deep greenway buffer along all water
bodies and watercourses, and a fifty-foot greenway buffer
alongside wetlands soils classified as "very poorly drained" in
the medium intensity county soil survey of the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service. These areas must be
conserved as secondary conservation areas but are considered
as developable areas for the purpose of calculating yield.
(b) One-hundred-year floodplains.
(c) Woodlands, individual specimen trees, or small stands of
significant trees.
(d) Aquifer recharge areas and areas with highly permeable
("excessively drained") soil.
(e) Significant wildlife habitat areas.
(f) Class I and Class II farmlands.
(g) Historic, archaeological or cultural features listed (or eligible
to be listed) on the National Register of Historic Places or the
Historic Resources Surveys of the Nebraska State Historical
Society.
§ 410-27.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-27.6
1:833
§ 410-27.7. Location standards for open space.
§ 410-27.8. Special processes for conservation developments.
The review and approval process for subdivisions in the RC Overlay District
is the same as that for conventional subdivisions, as set forth in Article 38.
Additional provisions and approval processes are set forth in this section.
(h) Slopes in excess of 15%.
(i) Ridgelines and view corridors.
(j) Land with soils that do not support residential development.
A. Access to residential lots. Undivided open space shall be directly
accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within a
conservation subdivision. To achieve this, the majority of house lots
should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and
access. Safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from
all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided (except in the
case of farmland, or other resource areas vulnerable to trampling
damage or human disturbance). Where the undivided open space is
designated as separate, noncontiguous parcels, no parcel shall consist
of less than three acres in area nor have a length-to-width ratio in
excess of 4:1, except such areas that are specifically designed as village
greens, ballfields, upland buffers to wetlands, water bodies or
watercourses, or trail links.
B. Interconnection of open spaces. Protected open spaces in each new
subdivision are encouraged to adjoin each other, ultimately forming an
interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas
across the county. The only elements of the network that would
necessarily be open to the public are those lands that have been
required to be dedicated for public use and typically configured in a
linear fashion as an element of Seward's long-range open space
network through the Comprehensive Development Plan.
A. Existing features plan.
(1) Plans analyzing each site's special features are required for all
proposed subdivisions. The existing features plan shall include, at a
minimum:
(a) A contour map based at least upon topographical maps
published by the United States Geological Survey;
(b) The location of severely constraining elements such as steep
slopes (over 25%), wetlands, watercourses, intermittent
streams and one-hundred-year floodplains, and all rights-ofway
and easements;
§ 410-27.6 SEWARD CODE § 410-27.8
1:834
(c) Soil boundaries as shown on USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service medium intensity maps; and
(d) The location of significant features such as woodlands,
treelines, open fields or meadows, scenic views into or out from
property, watershed divides and drainageways, fences or stone
walls, rock outcrops, and existing structures, roads, tracks and
trails.
(2) The existing features plan shall identify both primary conservation
areas and secondary conservation areas, as described in
§ 410-27.6B(1) and (2) of this article. The existing features plan
shall form the basis for the conceptual preliminary plan, which
shall show the tentative location of houses, streets, lot lines, and
greenway lands in new subdivisions, according to the four-step
design process described in Subsection B below.
B. Conceptual preliminary plan.
(1) A sketch plan or a conceptual preliminary plan shall be submitted
for all proposed subdivisions to the Zoning Administrator before
submission of a formal preliminary plat application. A conceptual
preliminary plan presents a conceptual layout for greenway and
open lands, house sites, and street alignments. Each conceptual
preliminary plan shall follow a four-step design process, as
described below. Applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to
the Zoning Administrator that these four design steps were
followed in the preparation of the plan.
(a) Step One: Designating the Open Space. During the first step,
all potential conservation areas (both primary and secondary
as defined above) are identified, using the existing features
plan.
(b) Step Two: Location of House Sites. During the second step,
potential house sites are located. Subdivision applicants shall
identify tentative house sites on the conceptual preliminary
plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan. House
sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet to
primary conservation areas, but may be situated within 50 feet
of secondary conservation areas, in order to enjoy views of the
latter without negatively affecting the former.
(c) Step Three: Street and Lot Layout. The third step consists of
aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each
house in the most reasonable and economical way. When lots
and access streets are laid out, they shall be located in a way
that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on both the
primary and secondary conservation areas. To the greatest
extent practicable, wetland crossings and streets traversing
existing slopes over 15% shall be strongly discouraged. Street
connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the
§ 410-27.8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-27.8
1:835
§ 410-27.9. Ownership and maintenance of common open space.
Developments in the RC Overlay District shall provide for ownership and
maintenance of common open space. Common open space within a
development shall be owned, administered, and maintained by any of the
following methods, either individually or in combination, and subject to
approval by the City.
number of new culs-de-sac to be maintained and to facilitate
easy access to and from homes in different parts of the
property (and on adjoining parcels). Where culs-de-sac are
necessary, those serving six or fewer homes may be designed
with "hammerheads" facilitating three-point turns. In TND
Districts, the location of house sites follows the location of
streets and squares.
(d) Step Four: Lot Lines. The fourth step is simply to draw in the
lot line (where applicable). These are generally drawn midway
between house locations and may include L-shaped "flag lots"
meeting the City's minimum standards for the same.
(2) Review and comments. The Zoning Administrator and the Public
Works Director shall return written comments on the conceptual
preliminary plan to the applicant within 30 days of submittal. These
comments should recommend changes to be made prior to
submittal of a preliminary plat application.
A. Offer of dedication. The City of Seward, Seward County, or the Natural
Resources District shall have the first and last offer of dedication of
undivided open space in the event said land is to be conveyed.
Dedication shall take the form of a fee simple ownership. The City or
other public agency may, but shall not be required to accept undivided
open space, provided: 1) such land is accessible to the residents of the
county; 2) there is no cost of acquisition other than any costs incidental
to the transfer of ownership, such as title insurance; and 3) the county
agrees to and has access to maintain such lands. Alternatively, a public
agency may accept an easement, subject to the above conditions.
B. Homeowners' association. The undivided open space and associated
facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowners'
association. The association shall be formed and operated under the
following provisions:
(1) The developer shall provide a description of the association,
including its bylaws and methods for maintaining the open space.
(2) The association shall be organized by the developer and shall be
operated with financial assistance from the developer, before the
sale of any lots within the development.
(3) Membership in the association is automatic (mandatory) for all
purchasers of homes therein and their successors. The conditions
§ 410-27.8 SEWARD CODE § 410-27.9
1:836
§ 410-27.10. Maintenance standards.
and timing of transferring control of the association from developer
to homeowners shall be identified.
(4) The association shall be responsible for maintenance of insurance
and taxes on undivided open space, enforceable by liens placed by
the county on the association. The association may place liens on
the homes or house lots of its members who fail to pay their
association dues in a timely manner. Such liens may require the
imposition of penalty interest charges.
(5) The members of the association shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing such undivided open space. Shares
shall be defined within the association bylaws.
(6) In the event of a proposed transfer, within the methods here
permitted, of undivided open space land by the homeowners'
association, or of the assumption of maintenance of undivided open
space land by a public agency, notice of such action shall be given
to all property owners within the development.
(7) The homeowners' association may lease open space lands to any
other qualified person, or corporation, for operation and
maintenance of open space lands.
C. Condominiums. The undivided open space and associated facilities may
be controlled through the use of condominium agreements. Such
agreements shall be in conformance with the state statute. All
undivided open space land shall be held as a "common element."
D. Transfer of easements to a private conservation organization. An owner
may transfer easements to a private, nonprofit organization, among
whose purposes it is to conserve open space and/or natural resources,
provided that:
(1) The organization is acceptable to the City, and is a bona fide
conservation organization with perpetual existence;
(2) The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for proper
reverter or retransfer in the event that the organization becomes
unwilling or unable to continue carrying out its functions; and
(3) A maintenance agreement acceptable to the Planning Commission
is entered into by the developer and the organization.474
A. Financial responsibility. The ultimate owner of the open space (typically
a homeowners' association) shall be responsible for raising all monies
required for operations, maintenance, or physical improvements to the
open space through annual dues, special assessments, etc. The

§ 410-27.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-27.10
1:837
§ 410-27.11. Evaluation criteria.
In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will
be considered by the Planning Commission and City Council as indicating
design appropriate to the site's natural, historic, and cultural features, and
meeting the purpose of this chapter:
homeowners' association shall be authorized under its bylaws to place
liens on the property of residents who fall delinquent in payment of
such dues or assessments.
B. Maintenance enforcement.
(1) In the event that the association or any successor organization
shall, at any time after establishment of a development containing
undivided open space, fail to maintain the undivided open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the City may serve written notice upon the
owner of record, setting forth the manner in which the owner of
record has failed to maintain the undivided open space in
reasonable condition.
(2) Failure to adequately maintain the undivided open space in
reasonable order and condition constitutes a violation of this
chapter.
(3) Should any bill or bills for maintenance of undivided open space by
the City or county be unpaid, a late fee of 15% shall be added to
such bills and a lien shall be filed against the premises in the same
manner as other municipal claims.
A. Protection of floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing,
grading, filling, or construction, except as may be approved for
essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities.
B. Preservation and maintenance of woodlands, existing fields, pastures,
meadows, and orchards, and sufficient buffer areas to minimize
conflicts between residential and agricultural uses.
C. Maintenance of buffers at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands
and surface waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and
ponds.
D. Design around existing treelines between fields or meadows, and
minimal impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres),
especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife
habitat.
E. Maintenance of scenic views.
F. Avoidance of new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by
taking advantage of lower topographic features.
§ 410-27.10 SEWARD CODE § 410-27.11
1:838
G. Protection of wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered,
threatened, or of special concern by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency.
H. Design around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological, or
cultural value, including stone walls, barn foundations, cellar holes,
earthworks, and burial grounds.
I. Protection of rural character and improves public safety and vehicular
carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly onto
existing public roads.
J. Landscaping of common areas if appropriate.
K. Provision of active or passive recreational areas in suitable locations
that offer convenient access by residents and adequate screening from
nearby house lots.
L. Inclusion of a pedestrian circulation system providing access between
properties, activities, or special features within the neighborhood open
space system. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails.
M. Provision of open space that is reasonably contiguous, avoiding
fragmented open spaces.

ARTICLE 29
FP/FW Floodplain/Floodway Overlay District
§ 410-29.1. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize losses to property by applying the
provisions of this article to:
§ 410-29.2. Findings; applicability; enforcement officer;
interpreting district boundaries; interpretation; appeals.
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights
or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that
serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction.
C. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuitable for intended
purposes because of flood hazard.
D. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance
Program when identified by the Federal Insurance Administration as a
flood-prone community.
A. Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. Flood hazard areas of
the City of Seward, Nebraska, are subject to inundation that results in
loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(1) General causes of these flood losses. These flood losses are caused
by:
(a) The cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing
increases in flood heights and velocities;
(b) The occupancy of flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flood damages.
(2) Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This article uses a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards that consists of a
series of interrelated steps:
(a) Selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors
as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated
§ 410-29.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-29.2
1:843
and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this
article is representative of large floods that are reasonably
characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general
order of a flood which could be expected to have a one-percent
chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated by
applicable Flood Insurance Studies and the Federal
Emergency Management Administration's Flood Insurance
Rate Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, or any
subsequent effective Flood Insurance Studies, Rate Maps, and
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps issued after the effective
date of this article and adopted by the City of Seward.
(b) Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and
overbank areas to convey the base flood.
(c) Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood
without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any
point.
(d) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in
flood height.
(e) Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the
floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to
inundation by the base flood.
B. Land to which article applies. This article shall apply to all lands within
the jurisdiction of the City of Seward identified on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) as numbered and unnumbered A Zone and/or within
the Overlay Districts FP and FW established in this article. In all areas
covered by this article, no development shall be permitted except upon
a permit to develop granted by the City Council or its duly designated
representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City
Council may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of
the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community as
contained in the City Code.
C. Enforcement officer. The Chief Building Official of the City of Seward is
hereby designated as the City Council's duly designated enforcement
officer under this article. Unless otherwise provided by the City
Council, the Central Platte or Tri-Basin Natural Resources District shall
assist the City of Seward on interpretation of floodplain/floodway rules
and regulations. The enforcement officer shall obtain comments from
the NRD as part of his/her review of all proposed activity in this overlay
district.
D. Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the
Floodway and Floodway Fringe Overlay Districts shall be determined
by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is
§ 410-29.2 SEWARD CODE § 410-29.2
1:844
needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown
on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be
a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the
enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such
cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment
will resolve the dispute. The base flood elevation for the point in
question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary
on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board
and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires.
E. Compliance. No development located within known flood hazard areas
of the community shall be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other
applicable regulations.
F. Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this article to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
G. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the City of Seward and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state
statute.
H. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study.
Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas
outside floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses
permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Seward or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
I. Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this article is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected thereby.
J. Application for appeal. Where a request for a permit to develop is
denied by the Chief Building Official, the applicant may apply for such
permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment. Procedures for
appeals to the Board of Adjustment shall proceed as set forth by
§§ 410-44.8 through 410-44.10 of this chapter.
§ 410-29.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-29.3
1:845
§ 410-29.3. Floodplain and floodway permits; administration.
A. Permit required. No person, firm, or corporation shall initiate any
development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done
without first obtaining a separate permit for development as defined in
this section.
B. Administration.
(1) The Chief Building Official is hereby appointed to administer and
implement the provisions of this article.
(2) Duties of the Chief Building Official shall include, but not be limited
to:
(a) Review of all development permits to assure that sites are
reasonably safe from flooding and that the permit
requirements of this article have been satisfied.
(b) Review permits for proposed development to assure that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those federal,
state or local governmental agencies from which prior
approval is required.
(c) Notify adjacent communities and the appropriate Natural
Resources District prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Insurance Administration when participating in the
National Flood Insurance Program.
(d) Notify the appropriate Natural Resources District of any
proposed construction and development activity in floodplain
areas, and/or upon land situated within the Floodplain/
Floodway Overlay Zoning District.
(e) Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying
capacity is not diminished.
(f) Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures.
(g) Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the new or substantially improved structures
have been floodproofed.
(h) When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the
Chief Building Official shall be presented certification from a
registered professional engineer or architect.
§ 410-29.3 SEWARD CODE § 410-29.3
1:846
§ 410-29.4. Establishment of zoning districts.
The mapped floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this article are
hereby divided into the two following districts: a Floodway Overlay District
(FW) and a Floodplain Overlay District (FP) as identified in the official
Floodplain Study. Within these districts, all uses not meeting the standards
of this article and those standards of the underlying zoning district shall
be prohibited. These zones shall be consistent with the numbered and
unnumbered A Zones as identified on the official FIRM when identified
in the Flood Insurance Study provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration.
§ 410-29.5. District standards.
C. Application for permit. To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file
an application in writing on a form furnished for that purpose. Every
such application shall:
(1) Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit.
(2) Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot,
block, tract and house and street address, or similar description
that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building
or work.
(3) Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is
intended.
(4) Be accompanied by plans for the proposed construction.
(5) Be signed by the permittee or his authorized agent, who may be
required to submit evidence to indicate such authority.
(6) Give such other information as reasonably may be required by the
Chief Building Official.
A. No permit for development shall be granted for new construction,
substantial improvement or other improvements, including the
placement of manufactured homes, within the identified floodplain
unless the conditions of this section are satisfied.
B. All areas identified as unnumbered A Zones by the Federal Insurance
Administration are subject to inundation of the one-hundred-year flood;
however, the water surface elevation was not provided. The
unnumbered A Zones shall be subject to all development provisions of
this article. If Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the
community shall utilize any base flood elevation data currently
available within its area of jurisdiction. Further, in cases of proposed
development within unnumbered A Zones, the developer's engineer
shall be required to conduct the necessary studies to determine the
one-hundred-year flood elevation and its extent in relation to such
development.

C. New construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvement,
prefabricated buildings, placement of manufactured homes and other
development shall require:
(1) Design or anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
(2) New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage
systems designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into
floodwaters, and on-site waste disposal systems to be located so as
to avoid impairment or contamination.
(3) Construction with materials resistant to flood damage, utilizing
methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and with
electrical, heating, and ventilation that are designed and/or located
so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
(4) All utility and sanitary facilities to be elevated or floodproofed one
foot above the regulatory flood elevation. Such floodproofing is
permitted only for nonresidential properties.
(5) That until a floodway has been designated, no development,
including landfill, may be permitted within the identified floodplain
unless the applicant for the land use has demonstrated that the
proposed use, when combined with all other existing and
reasonably anticipated uses, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the one-hundred-year flood more than one foot on the
average cross-section of the reach in which the development or
landfill is located as shown in the official floodplain study
incorporated by reference herein.
(6) Storage of materials and equipment.
(a) The storage of processing of materials that are in time of
flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to
human, animal or plant life is prohibited.

(d) Proposals for development (including proposals for
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) of five acres or 50
lots, whichever is less, include within such proposals the
regulatory flood elevation.
A. Permitted uses. Any use permitted in the underlying base district shall
be permitted in the Floodplain Overlay District. No use shall be
permitted in the district unless the standards of this section are met.
B. Standards for the Floodplain Overlay District.
(1) Any new construction or substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
one foot above the base flood elevation.
(2) Any new construction or substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation, or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be
floodproofed so that below such a level the structure is watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the enforcement official. Such floodproofing is
permitted only for nonresidential properties.
(3) All new construction and substantial improvements that fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding
shall be designated to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by the registered professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two
openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be

(b) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any
space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Such certification
shall be provided to the official as set forth in § 410-29.3.
(c) Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be
required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from
proposed structures.
A. Permitted uses. Only uses having a low flood-damage potential and not
obstructing flood flows shall be permitted within the Floodway District
to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance and
provided that they do not require structures, fill or storage of materials
or equipment. No use shall increase the flood levels of the base flood
elevation. These uses are subject to the standards of § 410-29.5 and
other applicable sections.
(1) Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries,
forestry.
(2) Accessory residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and
play areas.
(3) Nonresidential areas such as loading areas, parking, and airport
landing strips.
(4) Public and private recreational uses such as golf courses, archery
ranges, picnic grounds, parks, wildlife and nature preserves. New
placement of residential structures, including manufactured

alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Chief Building Official in the enforcement or
administration of this article.
C. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court as provided by
Nebraska state statutes.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this article, and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of a proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.

transport of the floodwaters and the effect of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(11) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
E. Conditions for variance.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided items
§ 410-29.8 SEWARD CODE § 410-29.8
1:852
§ 410-29.9. Nonconforming uses.
(2) through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical jurisdiction
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) In addition to the criteria for variances set forth in Subsection D of
this section, variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a
written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
lowest floor elevation.
A. Continuance of nonconforming uses. A structure or the use of a
structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or
amendment of this article but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this article may be continued, subject to the following
conditions:
(1) No such use or substantial improvement of that use shall be
expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its
nonconformity.
(2) If such use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this article. The
Utility Department shall notify the Building Inspector in writing of
instances of nonconforming uses where utility services have been
discontinued for a period of 12 months.

or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be
reconstructed if the cost is more than 50% of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred within those areas identified as
floodway (FW). This limitation does not include the cost of any
alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary,
building, or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a
structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State
Inventory of Historic Places.
C. Replacement of nonresidential uses. If any nonresidential
nonconforming use of structure is destroyed by any means, including
flood, it should not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred, except if it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this article. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic
Places.

a definite bed and banks to confine and conduct continuously or periodically
flowing water. Channel flow, thus, is that water which is flowing within the
limits of a defined channel.
COMMUNITY  Any state or area or political subdivision thereof which has
authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for the
area within its jurisdiction.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real

components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM  Those physical structural works
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent
of the area within a community subject to a special flood hazard. Such a
system typically includes levees or dikes. These specialized modifying works
are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODWAY (FW)  The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent portion of the floodplain that must be reserved in order to
discharge the one-hundred-year flood without cumulatively increasing the
water surface elevation more than one foot at any point, assuming equal
conveyance reduction outside the channel from the two sides of the
floodplain.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the heights calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE  The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that
such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this article.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.
For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also
includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on
a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the
term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers,
and other similar vehicles.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A parcel (or
contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home
lots for rent or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION  Structures for which the start of construction or
substantial improvement is commenced on or after the effective date of the
FIRM.
OVERLAY DISTRICT  A district which acts in conjunction with the
underlying zoning district or districts.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  For other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub.
§ 410-29.10 SEWARD CODE § 410-29.10
1:856
Law 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such
as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of street
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation of the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building that is principally above
ground, as well as a manufactured home, and a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any repair, reconstruction, or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure either 1) before the improvement or repair
is started, or 2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored,
before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial
improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The
term does not, however, include either 1) any project for improvement
of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or
safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or 2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register
of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
VARIANCE  A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

AV Aviation Overlay District
§ 410-30.1. Purpose.
The AV Aviation Overlay District is intended to provide for the safe
operation of aircraft into and out of Seward Municipal Airport, located in
Section 5, Township 10 North, Range 3 East in Seward County, Nebraska.
The district provides special regulations to maintain adequate clearance
and to eliminate potential hazard, safety, and development conflicts
between airport operations and surrounding development. The following
additional regulations shall apply to such lands within the corporate limits
of Seward, Nebraska and its two-mile zoning jurisdiction within the area of
three miles in all directions from the boundaries of any airport. This area
within three miles of the boundaries of said airport shall be known as the
"airport hazard area" and shall be regulated as follows.
§ 410-30.2. Boundaries and zone descriptions.
A. Detailed description of hazard area. The hazard area consists of
approach and operation zones, transition zones, and turning zones.
(1) The outer boundary of the hazard area is composed of a series of
connected tangents and simple curves which also constitute the
outer boundaries of the approach and turning zones.
(2) The inner boundary of the hazard area is a boundary consisting of a
series of intersecting tangents, 500 feet from and parallel to the
center line of the instrument runway or landing strip and 250 feet
from and parallel to the respective center lines of all other runways
or landing strips and connecting the inner boundaries of adjacent
approach zones at the ends of the runways, landing strips or
proposed runways or landing strips.
B. Zone descriptions.
(1) An operation zone shall be located at each end of each existing or
proposed runway, landing strip or other portion of the airfield used
regularly, or to be used regularly, for the landing or taking off of
airplanes. Such approach zones shall begin 200 feet beyond the
ends of their respective strips and at such beginning shall be 1,000
feet in width for the instrument runway or landing strip and 500
feet in width for all other runways and landing strips. The approach
zones shall begin at the ends of their respective operation zones
and shall extend and expand uniformly centered along the
extended center line of the respective landing strip, to the outer
boundary of the approach zone at a rate of 30 feet of width for each
100 feet of horizontal length for the instrument runway or landing
strip and 20 feet of width for each 100 feet of horizontal length of
all other runways.
§ 410-30.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-30.2
1:859
§ 410-30.3. Height restrictions.
(a) The inner area of each approach zone shall be that portion of
the approach zone beginning 200 feet beyond the end of the
respective or proposed landing strip and extending to the
intersection of the controlling glide angle with a plane 150 feet
above the highest elevations of the end of the respective
runway or landing strip.
(b) The outer area of each approach zone shall be the area
between the inner area of the approach zone and the outer
limit of the approach zone.
(2) The transition zones shall be the areas bounded by the inner
boundary of the hazard area, the sides of contiguous inner areas of
approach zones and the outer limits of the transition zones; said
outer limits of the transition zones being the intersections, at
elevations of 150 feet above the highest elevation at the ends or
edges of the closest runway or landing strip, or proposed runway or
landing strip, of a series of contiguous planes originating from
bases established by the inner boundary of the hazard area and the
edges of adjacent inner areas of approach zones; said planes rising
from their respective bases at the rate of one foot vertically to
seven feet horizontally to the lines of intersection previously
referred to.
(3) The turning zones shall comprise all portions of the hazard area not
contained in the approach zones and in the transition zones. The
outer limits of the turning zones shall be a series of points forming
a line which is a horizontal distance of three statute miles from the
nearest points of the airport's property line boundary.
A. Height regulations. No building, transmission line, communication line,
pole, tree, smokestack, chimney, wires, tower or other structure or
appurtenance thereto of any kind or character shall hereafter be
erected, constructed, repaired or established, nor shall any tree or
other object of natural growth be allowed to grow:
(1) In inner areas of approach zones to a height above the elevation of
the nearest point on the end or proposed end of said instrument
runway or landing strip in excess of 1/50 and all other runways or
landing strips in excess of 1/40 of the distance from the end of the
approach zone to said structure or object.
(2) In the outer area of approach zones and in turning zones to a height
in excess of 150 feet above the elevation at the end or proposed end
of the nearest runway or landing strip.
(3) In the transition zones to a height above the planes forming the
transition slopes.

(4) In the existing or proposed operation zones to a height above the
existing or proposed finished grade of said runways or landing
strips or the surface of the ground.
B. Exceptions. In the outer area or approach zones and within the turning
zones, these height regulations shall not apply to construction or
planting which is no higher than 75 feet above the elevation of the end
of the nearest runway or landing strip.
A. Permit required. It shall hereafter be unlawful to erect, construct,
reconstruct, repair or establish any building, transmission line,
communication line, pole, tree, tower, smokestack, chimney, wires or
other structure or appurtenance thereto of any kind or character or to
plant or replant any tree or other object of natural growth within the
boundary of the hazard area of said airport without first obtaining a
permit from the Building Official of Seward, Nebraska.
B. Application forms. Application for a permit as required under these
regulations shall be made upon a form to be available in the office of the
Building Official, Seward, Nebraska, and shall indicate the approximate
location, ground elevation with reference to the elevation at the end of
the nearest runway or landing strip and height of the proposed
structure or planting.
A. Nonconforming structures. Within the hazard area as hereinbefore
defined, no nonconforming building, transmission line, communication
line, pole, tree, tower, smokestack, chimney, wires or other structure or
appurtenance thereto of any kind or character or object of natural
growth shall hereafter be replaced, substantially reconstructed,
repaired, altered, replanted or allowed to grow, as the case may be, to a
height which constitutes a greater hazard to air navigation than existed
before these regulations were adopted; if such structures or objects of
natural growth have been torn down, destroyed, have deteriorated or
decayed to an extent of 80% or more, or abandoned for a period of 12
months or more. "Transmission lines" and "communication lines" as
referred to in these regulations shall be interpreted to mean all poles,
wires, guys and all other equipment necessary for the operation and
maintenance of same within the zone regulated.
B. Marking of nonconforming structures. Whenever the Building Official
shall determine, or shall be notified by the Joint Zoning Board or the
Nebraska Department of Aeronautics, that a specific nonconforming
structure or object exists and has existed prior to the passage of these
regulations and within the zones area hereinbefore described at such
height or in such position as to constitute a hazard to the safe operation
of aircraft landing at or taking off from said airport, the owner or
owners and the lessor or lessors of the premises on which such

4-3-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-10]
A. Tower siting.
(1) It is the policy of the City of Seward to encourage co-location of
new communications towers with existing towers or as part of
suitable existing structures. All applications for approval of a
communications tower location shall include evidence that all
potential alternatives for location on existing towers have been
explored and exhausted. Applicants may not be denied space on an
existing tower within the City of Seward and its jurisdiction unless
mechanical, structural, regulatory factors, or legitimate business
expansion plans prohibit co-location.
(2) The applicant for a communications tower location is required to
demonstrate as part of its application that the tower must be
located on the proposed site in order to satisfy its function in the
company's system. The applicant must also demonstrate that the
proposed height is the minimum height necessary for the
successful functioning of the tower.
§ 410-31.7 SEWARD CODE § 410-31.8
1:878
B. Tower setbacks, design, and height.
(1) Freestanding towers shall be located so that the distance from the
base of the tower to any adjoining property line or the supporting
structure of a separate neighboring tower is a minimum of 100% of
the tower height. The Planning Commission may recommend and
the City Council approve a reduction to the setback with a
conditional use permit if they determine that such reduction does
not constitute a hazard to safety or property on adjacent properties
or rights-of-way.
(2) The tower installation shall be designed to be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with the built environment of the City of
Seward. The City encourages efforts to hide towers or restrict their
visibility from public rights-of-way or neighboring properties.
Associated support buildings shall be designed with materials that
are consistent with those in the surrounding neighborhood. Metal
exteriors shall generally not be permitted for accessory support
buildings.
(3) All tower installations shall maintain landscaped peripheral yards
with a minimum depth of 35 feet from surrounding property lines.
One tree consistent with the provisions of Article 33 shall be
planted for every 500 square feet of required peripheral yard area.
(4) As part of the conditional use permit approval process, the City
Council may permit the tower to exceed the height restrictions
otherwise allowable in the district.
(5) Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or
background that minimizes their visibility, unless a different color
is required by the FCC or FAA.
(6) Lights, signals and signs. No signals, lights or signs shall be
permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or the FAA. Should
lighting be required, at the time of construction of the tower in
cases where there are residential users located within a distance
which is 300% of the height of the tower from the tower, then dualmode
lighting shall be requested from the FAA. Lighting on towers
shall not exceed the minimum requirements of the FAA or other
regulatory agencies.
(7) Adequate security measures are required at the base of the tower
to prevent vandalism or hazards resulting from casual access to the
facility.
C. City site selection criteria in evaluating applications for
communications towers.
(1) Consistent with the policy of this chapter, the telecommunications
company proposing to construct an antenna support structure, or
mount an antenna on an existing structure, shall demonstrate,
§ 410-31.8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-31.8
1:879
using technological evidence, that the antenna must go where it
is proposed in order to satisfy its function in the company's grid
system. Further, the company must demonstrate by technological
evidence that the height requested is the minimum height
necessary.
(2) Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the
applicant demonstrates that it is either an FCC-licensed
telecommunications provider or has in place necessary agreements
with an FCC-licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease
of the support structure.
(3) Personal wireless service facilities should be located and designed
to minimize any impacts on residential property values. Sites
should be placed in locations where the existing topography,
vegetation, buildings or other structures provide the greatest
amount of screening.
(4) Location and design of sites in all districts should consider the
impact of the site on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual
impact within the zone district. In residential districts and
residential land use areas, the minimum lot size for towers shall be
three acres.
D. Priorities for siting.
(1) The following establishes the order of priorities for locating new
communications facilities:
(a) Public property (excluding prairie, conservation or wildlife
areas, or historic structures).
(b) Appropriate existing structures, such as buildings, towers,
water towers, and smokestacks in other zoned districts.
(c) AG, I-1 or I-2 Districts that do not adjoin or adversely impact
residential neighborhoods.
(d) Private nonresidential property in C-2 or C-3 Districts.
(e) Private, nonresidential properties in C-1 or UC Districts.
(f) Placement of antennas and towers on multifamily residential
structures exceeding 30 feet in height in districts zoned R-3
and R-4.
(g) Residential districts only if locations for which a need has been
demonstrated are not available on existing structures or in
nonresidential districts; and only on or in existing churches,
parks, schools, utility facilities or other appropriate public
facilities.
§ 410-31.8 SEWARD CODE § 410-31.8
1:880
§ 410-31.9. Miscellaneous uses.
(2) An applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a
residential zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort
has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities on
a government structure, a private institutional structure, or other
appropriate existing structures within a nonresidential zoning
district, and that due to valid considerations, including physical
constraints, or technological feasibility, no appropriate location is
available. The telecommunications company is required to
demonstrate that it contacted the owners of structures in excess of
30 feet within a one-quarter-mile radius of the site proposed, asked
for permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was
denied for reasons other than economic ones. The information
submitted by the applicant shall include a map of the area to be
served by the tower, its relationship to other antenna sites in the
applicant's network, and an evaluation of existing buildings taller
than 30 feet, towers and water tanks within one-quarter mile of the
proposed tower.
A. Landfills.

in pollution in any public water-based recreational facility or in any
waterway or well that is a part of a public or private water supply.
(4) Minimum separation from residential uses. No nonputrescible
landfill may be established within 300 feet of a developed
residential or public use. No landfill involving the disposal of
putrescible or septic wastes shall be established within one-quarter
mile of any residential, public, or commercial zoning district; or any
state or federal highway.
(5) Restoration of site. The site of any landfill must be restored,
stabilized, planted, and seeded within six months after the end of
the operation. Dissipation of waste products must be accomplished
in a manner approved by the State of Nebraska's Department of
Environmental Quality.

B. Wind energy conservation systems (WECS).
(1) The distance from all lot lines or any building or power line to any
tower support base of a WECS shall be equal to the sum of the
tower height and the diameter of the rotor. A reduction of this
requirement may be granted as part of a conditional use permit
approval if the City Council, after recommendation by the Planning
Commission, finds that the reduction is consistent with public
health, safety, and welfare.484
(2) The distance between the tower support bases of any two WECS
shall be the minimum of five rotor lengths, determined by the size
of the largest rotor. A reduction of this requirement may be granted

after recommendation by the Planning Commission, finds that the
reduction does not impede the operation of either WECS.485
(3) Any tower or rotor shall maintain a distance of at least 100
horizontal feet from any structure, power line, or antenna located
on another property.
(4) The WECS operation shall not interfere with radio, television,

Supplemental Development Regulations
§ 410-32.1. Purpose.
The supplemental site development regulations establish basic
requirements for developable lots, including frontage requirements. They
recognize the existence of special conditions that cannot comply literally
with the site development regulations set out for each zoning district.
Therefore, these regulations qualify or modify the district regulations of this
chapter and provide for specific areas of exception.
§ 410-32.2. Required street frontage.
Except as permitted below, any lot used in whole or part for residential
purposes shall provide a minimum frontage of 20 feet along at least one
public street, or shall possess an exclusive, uninterrupted private easement
of access or right-of-way of at least 20 feet wide to a public street. There
shall not be more than one single-family housing unit for such frontage or
easement. A common easement of access at least 40 feet in width may be
provided for two or more single-family units or for one or more duplex, twofamily,
townhouse, or multiple-family housing units.
§ 410-32.3. Lot size exceptions.
In any district permitting residential use types, a single-family use type may
be located on any lot or plot of official record but nonconforming in size as
of the effective date of this chapter, regardless of its area or width.
§ 410-32.4. Setback adjustments.
A. Lots adjoining alleys. In calculating the depth of a required side or rear
yard setback for a lot adjoining a dedicated public alley, one-half of the
alley may be credited as a portion of the yard. However, no residential
structure may be nearer than five feet to the near side of the alley.
B. Encroachments on required yards. Every part of a required yard shall
be open and unobstructed from finished grade upward, except as
specified herein. [Amended 11-1-2005 by Ord. No. 54-05]

Landscaping and Screening Standards
§ 410-33.1. Purpose.
The landscaping and screening regulations provide additional guidance on
the development of sites within Seward by addressing landscaping and
screening requirements. They are designed to improve the appearance of
the community, buffer potentially incompatible land uses from one another,
and conserve the value of properties within the City of Seward and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction. The landscape and screening provisions are
further intended to expedite development approval by including
predictable, uniform standards for landscaping.
§ 410-33.2. Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall apply to all new development on each lot
or site upon application for a building permit, except for the following:
§ 410-33.3. Landscaping requirements.
Landscaping shall be required adjacent to each street property line and
shall extend to a minimum depth inward on private property as set forth in
the development regulations and summarized in Table 33A.
A. Reconstruction or replacement of a lawfully existing use or structure
following a casualty loss.
B. Remodeling, rehabilitation, or improvements to existing uses or
structures which do not substantially change the location of structures,
parking, or other site improvements.
C. Additions or enlargements of existing uses or structures which increase
floor area or impervious coverage area by less than 20% of the building
established on the site on the effective date of this chapter. Where such
cumulative additions or enlargements are 20% or greater, these
provisions shall apply only to that portion where the new development
occurs.

concept plan. The concept plan shall include:
(a) A location map showing the relationship of the proposed
subdivision to existing and proposed streets and public
facilities.
(b) A schematic plan illustrating the proposed layout of streets,
lots, and other features and their relationship to existing and
proposed site topography.
(3) Within 15 working days, the Zoning Administrator shall inform the
applicant about the consistency of the concept plan with the
objectives and policies of the City's Comprehensive Plan and
Unified Land Development Ordinance.
(4) The pre-application conference does not require a formal
application or payment of a fee.
D. Preliminary plat application.
(1) Application requirements. After the pre-application conference, the
applicant shall prepare and submit an application for preliminary
plat approval. The applicant shall prepare and file 20 copies of a
proposed preliminary plat. The application for preliminary plat
approval shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator at least 30
calendar days before the Planning Commission meeting at which
the application will be considered. The application shall consist of a
form established by the Zoning Administrator; the supporting
documents required for major subdivisions in Table 38A;523 and
payment of a filing fee and a notification fee as set from time to
time by the City Council. The plat shall not be accepted until the
filing fee has been paid.524
(2) Draft subdivision agreement. The preliminary plat application shall
include a draft of a subdivision agreement prepared by the City
following a format established by the City of Seward. The
subdivision agreement establishes the mutual responsibilities of
City and subdivider, including financing of public improvements;
the nature of performance bonds and guarantees that the
developer will offer; and the financing arrangements proposed for
the subdivision. The City may elect to waive this requirement if it
finds that such a subdivision agreement is unnecessary.

approval, or denial of the preliminary plat to the City Council.
In addition, the Commission may delay action on the
application in order to resolve outstanding issues.
(d) Following action by the Planning Commission, a written
recommendation summarizing the Commission's action shall
be transmitted to the City Council.
(e) The City Council, following proper notice, shall hold a public
hearing on each major subdivision and, following such public
hearing, shall take action on the application.
(f) Approval of a preliminary plat by the City Council shall not
constitute approval of a final plat. The approval shall be
considered an expression of conditional approval to guide the
preparation of a final plat, to be considered subsequently by
approving authorities. The preliminary approval shall confer
upon the applicant the following rights:
[1] The general terms and conditions under which the plat
was approved will not change.
[2] The applicant may submit for approval a final plat for the
whole or a part of the preliminary plat on or before the
expiration date of the preliminary approval. For some
subdivisions, the preliminary and final plats may be
submitted and approved simultaneously.
[3] The preliminary plat approval shall stay in force for an
indefinite period of time from the date of approval by the
City Council. The City Council may, at its discretion,
establish a specific effective period or expiration date for a
preliminary plat.
E. Final plat application process.
(1) Application requirements. The applicant shall prepare and submit
an application for final plat approval. The application for final plat
§ 410-38.4 SEWARD CODE § 410-38.4
1:942
approval shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator at least 21
calendar days before the Planning Commission meeting at which
the application will be considered. The application shall consist of a
form established by the City of Seward; the supporting documents
required for final plat approval of major subdivisions in Table
38A;525 and payment of a filing fee as set from time to time by the
City Council. The final plat shall not be accepted for filing until the
filing fee has been paid.
(2) Final subdivision agreement. The final plat application shall include
the final subdivision agreement to be executed between the City
and the applicant. The terms of this agreement shall be acted upon
along with action on the final plat.
(3) Performance bond. The subdivision agreement shall specify the
amount of the performance bond for public improvements to be
filed prior to receiving final plat approval or, alternately, shall
contain a statement that required improvements have been
satisfactorily completed. The performance bond, if required, must
be presented in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney prior to
final approval of the subdivision.
(4) Final plat approval.
(a) The Zoning Administrator and Planning Commission shall
review the final plat for consistency with the approved
preliminary plat and for compliance with the Unified Land
Development Ordinance and other applicable local, state, or
federal statutes and regulations. If the final plat meets all
conditions of the ordinance and is substantially consistent with
the terms of the preliminary plat approval, the Commission
shall have no recourse but to approve the final plat.
(b) If the Planning Commission finds in its review that the
submitted final plat is inconsistent with the preliminary plat,
does not comply with the conditions of relevant ordinances and
statutes, or requires a waiver of any section of the Unified Land
Development Ordinance, it shall hold a public hearing on the
final plat. Following such public hearing, the Commission shall
transmit its recommendation on the final plat to the City
Council.
(c) The City Council shall take final action on the application. The
City Council is further empowered to grant waivers of a section
of the Unified Land Development Ordinance after a waiver
request has received a recommendation from the Planning
Commission.
F. Filing the final plat.

Subdivision Design Criteria and General Standards
§ 410-39.1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide flexible design alternatives in
order to assure that subdivisions in the Seward area create functional
and attractive environments, minimize adverse effects, become assets to
the City's urban and natural setting, and adapt to their specific situation.
This article defines specific types of subdivisions that have varying design
characteristics, applicable to various settings within the City of Seward and
jurisdiction. It outlines specific design criteria that should be incorporated
into the concepts of various types of subdivisions.
§ 410-39.2. Site design and constraints.
A. Consideration of plans. The design of developments shall consider all
existing local and regional plans for Seward and its jurisdiction. These
include the Comprehensive Development Plan for the City of Seward.
B. Grading plan required.
(1) A grading plan is required for erosion and sediment control on all
construction sites greater than five acres in size. Prior to grading or
site-disturbing activity, the developer shall apply to the Building
Department for a grading permit. The application for a grading
permit shall include:
(a) A location map showing the location and extent of grading
activity.
(b) A sediment and erosion control plan.
(2) After submission of a complete application for a grading permit, the
Zoning Administrator shall review the application. As part of the
review, the Zoning Administrator shall circulate the petition to any
agency with statutory authority for the management of
drainageways and stormwater management.
(3) A grading permit shall be issued within 10 working days if the
Zoning Administrator has received assurances from applicable
state agencies that the sediment and erosion control plan is
compatible with statute, and further that it is compatible with the
objectives and policies of the City's Comprehensive Development
Plan and Unified Land Development Ordinance. If the submitted
sediment and erosion control plan is deemed inadequate, the
applicant will be given a list of mitigation measures that must be
included to ensure conformance. The Zoning Administrator shall
issue a grading permit to the applicant upon certification that
mitigation measures will be taken as prescribed, consistent with
applicable state and federal regulations regarding soil and
sediment erosion, and environmental water quality.
§ 410-39.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-39.2
1:945
C. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System stormwater permit.
The subdivider shall obtain coverage under the general National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit (Number NER
100000) for stormwater discharge. A copy of the general permit is
available at the office of the Public Works Superintendent. The
subdivider shall apply for authorization to discharge by submitting a
notice of intent (NOI) using Form CSW-NOI. The subdivider shall
comply with the terms and conditions of the general permit. A copy of
the NOI shall be submitted to the Public Works Superintendent along
with the agreement prior to the beginning of any construction
activities. This item shall be considered incidental to the project and
shall not be subject to a separate fee.
D. Preservation of natural features and drainage patterns.
(1) To the maximum extent possible, development shall be located to
preserve natural features of the site, to avoid areas of
environmental sensitivity, and to minimize negative impact and
alteration of natural features and drainage patterns.
(2) The subdivider shall give maximum consideration to the
preservation of the following areas as open space, to the extent
consistent with reasonable utilization of land:
(a) Wetlands and other unique environmental areas, as defined in
Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972
and delineated on wetlands maps prepared by the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service. Construction and fill activity
shall be prohibited on wetlands in excess of one acre in size.
Development and fill upon wetlands smaller than one acre in
size should be avoided whenever possible, but regulated by
permit authority of applicable state and federal agencies.
(b) Significant stands or mature specimens of trees shall be
designated by required tree surveys.
[1] Nonresidential and attached residential. No tree taller
than 20 feet or larger than 12 inches in diameter
(measured six inches above the ground) shall be removed
except when approved by the Zoning Administrator or his/
her designee. Trees removed subject to City approval shall
be replaced as noted in Table 39A. The owner of a site with
natural landscaping that is unhealthful (for example,
spaced too closely) may be permitted to plant replacement
trees in the parkway or elsewhere in the City, if approved
by the Zoning Administrator.
§ 410-39.2 SEWARD CODE § 410-39.2

Table 39A
Tree Replacement Schedule
Diameter of Removed
Tree
(inches)
Number of Replacement
Trees
12 to 25 4 trees at 2" or 2 trees at 4"
26 or greater 6 trees at 2" or 3 trees at 4"
[2] Single-family residential. Placement of the building must
avoid trees taller than 20 feet or larger than 12 inches in
diameter, measured 54 inches above the ground. Any such
tree removed or damaged shall be replaced by a species
compatible with existing trees, on a one-to-one basis. The
number of replacement trees will be limited by what can
be reasonably accommodated within the available lot area.
(c) Floodplain lands, other than areas that have already
experienced substantial development.
(d) Slopes in excess of 15% as measured over a ten-foot interval.
Development on slopes over 15% may be permitted only if an
erosion and slope stabilization plan is submitted and approved
with the development and if appropriate measures are taken in
compliance with this approved plan. The City may, at its
discretion, require the review and certification of such a plan
by a licensed professional engineer.
(e) Habitats of endangered species. Development shall avoid fill or
disturbance of habitat sites as identified on federal or state
lists administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service of the United States Department of the Interior, and
applicable state environmental regulatory agencies.
Developers are encouraged to preserve habitat areas as a
connected open space consistent with the parks and
greenways system designated in the Seward Comprehensive
Development Plan.
E. General guidelines for subdivision layout. Subdivisions shall be
designed to comply with the following overall performance objectives:
(1) Avoidance of adverse effects on groundwater and aquifer recharge.
(2) Reduction and minimizing of cut and fill.
(3) Avoidance or reduction of unnecessary impervious surfaces.
(4) Prevention of flooding and encroachment of water onto other
properties.
§ 410-39.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-39.2
1:947
(5) Provision of adequate access to lots, including alternative routes to
lots and sites within the subdivision and minimizing of culs-de-sac
over 600 feet.
(6) Mitigation of negative environmental effects on surrounding
properties, including effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic,
drainage, and utilities.
(7) Respect for the urban character and traditional layout of Seward,
including providing continuity to established street and community
facility networks; establishing linkages and connections between
new development and existing parts of the City; and preserving
historically and architecturally significant sites and buildings,
determined as those sites or districts either listed on or determined
to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places,
as determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer.
(8) Dedication of arterial, collector, and key local streets on the
general alignments specified in the Comprehensive Development
Plan.
F. Site design objectives and approval. The Planning Commission and City
Council shall take the above site design objectives into account during
their review and approval of subdivision applications.
§ 410-39.2 SEWARD CODE § 410-39.2
1:948
ARTICLE 40
Circulation System Design
§ 410-40.1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to assure the development of functional and
safe circulation patterns within new subdivisions, in order to encourage
economical and effective movement of motor vehicles, bicycles, and
pedestrians; provide access for public safety vehicles; and encourage the
development of circulation systems that enhance the quality of life within
new and existing neighborhoods in the City of Seward and its planning
jurisdiction.
§ 410-40.2. General standards.
The design of circulation systems should conform to the following general
standards and requirements:
A. Roadway system design.
(1) The road system shall be designed to permit safe and orderly
movement of traffic, to meet but not exceed needs of the present
and future served population; to be simple and logical; to respect
natural features, topography, and landscape; and to present an
attractive streetscape.
(2) The system shall conform with the City's Comprehensive
Development Plan. For streets not shown on the Comprehensive
Development Plan, the arrangement of streets shall provide for the
logical extension of existing streets.
(3) The street network of a subdivision should provide for logical,
continuous extensions of streets to subsequent later developments.
Such extensions shall make provision, when necessary, with a
temporary turnaround with a radius of at least 50 feet.
(4) The system shall provide adequate traffic flow through a
subdivision and provide at least two routes from each lot within the
subdivision to the rest of the City, except as explicitly permitted by
the approving authorities. Additionally, the system should be
designed to discourage through traffic from using local streets.
(5) The system should provide good internal street network
connectivity. Internal connectivity shall be measured by a
Connectivity Index, calculated as:
CI = L/N
§ 410-40.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-40.2
1:949
§ 410-40.3. Street hierarchy and design.
Where:
N = The number of nodes (including intersections and culde-
sac heads) in a subdivision.
L = The number of street links defined by those nodes.
A desirable target for street connectivity is an index of over 1.20.
B. Pedestrian and bicycle systems.
(1) A continuous pedestrian system shall be provided within each
nonindustrial subdivision, designed to conduct pedestrians
between every point in the subdivision in a safe manner.
(2) In conventional subdivisions, the pedestrian system will ordinarily
be provided by sidewalks placed parallel to and on both sides of
each street, with exceptions permitted to preserve natural
features, create visual interest, or maintain greenways and
pedestrianways proposed in the Seward Comprehensive
Development Plan.
(3) In innovative developments, the pedestrian system may be an
independent network diverging from streets but providing
continuous pedestrian access between all points.
(4) All aspects of the pedestrian system, including sidewalks and
intersection crossings, must be designed to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
(5) Bikeways or recreational trails shall be required only if specifically
indicated by the Comprehensive Development Plan. Any land
dedicated for trail development shall be credited toward the
satisfaction of pedestrian system and open space standards set
forth by this chapter.
A. Characteristics of the hierarchy.
(1) Streets shall be classified according to a street hierarchy with
design tailored to function.
(2) The street hierarchy shall be defined by road function and
projected average daily traffic (ADT), as calculated by trip
generation rates prepared by the Institute of Transportation
Engineers or other generally accepted standards.
(3) Each residential street shall be classified and designed to meet
appropriate standards for its entire length.
(4) The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the approving
agencies that the distribution of traffic created by the subdivision
§ 410-40.2 SEWARD CODE § 410-40.3
1:950
will not exceed the design capacity of the proposed street system
and its individual segments.
(5) The categories, functions, and projected traffic loads of the street
hierarchy are set forth in Table 40A.526
B. Cartway width.
(1) Cartway width for each street classification is determined by
parking and curbing requirements based on form or intensity of
adjacent development.
(2) To promote economical development of streets, minimum cartway
width should generally be used. Minimum cartway widths are set
forth in Table 40B.527
C. Curbs, gutters, and shoulders.
(1) Curbing shall be required for the purposes of safety, drainage, and
protection of the pavement edge, as set forth in Table 40C.528
(2) Requirements for curbs vary according to street function and the
nature of adjacent development. Adjacent development is defined
as "urban" or "rural" as follows:
(a) Rural: residential or predominately agricultural land use
where average lot frontage exceeds 150 feet and subdivisions
are not provided with urban services, including municipal
water and/or sanitary sewer. Rural subdivisions are typically
located within an RR District.
(b) Urban: residential land use where average lot frontage is less
than or equal to 150 feet and subdivisions are provided with
municipal water or sanitary sewer service; or adjacent land
uses include commercial, office, industrial, or civic use types.
(3) Where curbing is not required, edge definition and stabilization
shall be provided.
(4) Where curbing is required, shoulders and drainage swales may be
used only if soils or topography make the provision of shoulders
preferable to curbs; or where the character of an area is preserved
by the use of shoulders and drainage swales.
(5) Shoulders, when developed, shall be at least eight feet in width on
each side for all streets; and located within the right-of-way. Swale
width is site-specific. Shoulders shall consist of stabilized turf or
other acceptable material.

1:951
(6) All curbs shall provide ramps for accessibility by handicapped
people consistent with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
(7) Curb construction shall follow standards established by the City of
Seward.
D. Sidewalks.
(1) Sidewalk requirements are determined by road classification and
intensity of development, as set forth in Table 40C.529
(2) Where sidewalks are not otherwise required by Table 40C, the City
Council may require their installation if necessary to provide
access to generators of pedestrian traffic or major community
features; to continue a walk on an adjacent street; to link parts of
the City; or to accommodate future development.
(3) In conventional development, sidewalks shall be placed generally
parallel to streets within the right-of-way. Exceptions are possible
to preserve important natural features or to accommodate
topography or vegetation; when an applicant shows an alternative
for a safe and convenient pedestrian system; or in conservation or
traditional neighborhood development (TND) subdivisions.
(4) In commercial areas, sidewalks may abut curbs, provided they are
a minimum of five feet wide. In industrial areas, sidewalks are not
mandatory but may be ordered in by the City Council.
(5) Pedestrian rights-of-way at least 15 feet in width may be required
through the center of blocks over 600 feet in length if deemed
necessary by the approving agencies to provide access to schools
or community facilities; or to maintain a continuous pedestrian
network within and between subdivisions and districts of the City
of Seward and its jurisdiction. Such rights-of-way shall be
dedicated to the public in the same manner as streets.
(6) Sidewalks shall provide a clear path of at least four feet in width,
free of any obstructions.
(7) All sidewalks shall be constructed according to current standards
in use by the City of Seward. Sidewalks shall be of concrete
construction four inches thick except at points of vehicular
crossing, where they shall be six inches thick and no less than a
minimum of six sack mix.
(8) All sidewalks, crossings, and other segments of a continuous
pedestrian system must comply with standards of the Americans
with Disabilities Act.
E. Bikeways and recreational trails.
529. Editor's Note: Table 40C is included at the end of this article.
§ 410-40.3 SEWARD CODE § 410-40.3
1:952
(1) Bikeways and recreational trails shall be required in subdivisions
only when specified as part of the Comprehensive Development
Plan.
(2) All off-street recreational trails shall be a minimum of 10 feet in
width for two-way traffic and comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act. Surfacing of trails shall be acceptable to the City of
Seward. Gradients for bikeways and recreational trails should not
exceed 5%, except for short distances. Minimum dedicated trail
right-of-way shall be 20 feet unless varied by the City Council.
(3) Recreational trails may satisfy part of the requirements of this
chapter for sidewalks or open space.
(4) All residential streets shall utilize bicycle-safe drainage grates at
storm sewer inlets.
F. Alleys. It is the general policy of the City of Seward to discourage the
use of alleys outside of planned unit developments or traditional
neighborhood developments. When permitted in such projects, alleys
shall be paved and shall have a width of not less than 14 feet. Alleys
shall not be used for parking.
G. Right-of-way.
(1) Measurement. The right-of-way of a street shall be measured from
lot line to lot line, and shall be wide enough to contain the cartway,
curbs or shoulder, sidewalks and sidewalk setbacks, other
necessary graded areas, and utilities.
(2) Any right-of-way that continues an existing street shall be no less
than that of the existing street.
(3) The requirements for rights-of-way for functional categories of
roads is set forth in Table 40C.530
(4) Dedications. Dedications of rights-of-way for collector, community,
or arterial streets shall be made consistent with the Comprehensive
Development Plan.
H. Street design standards.
(1) Pavement.
(a) All streets shall be paved to current standards utilized in the
City of Seward except:
[1] Local streets in rural subdivisions. Rural subdivisions may
utilize a gravel or crushed rock surface of sufficient
thickness and with an adequate base to provide a durable
surface. This permission is subject to submission of a
530. Editor's Note: Table 40C is included at the end of this article.
§ 410-40.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-40.3
1:953
petition by the platting owners binding themselves and
all succeeding property owners to agree that all paving
would be completed by a special assessment project if the
subdivision were annexed by the City. Such petition shall
waive any required resolution of necessity, any applicable
limitations of the amount that could be assessed against
subdivision property owners, including intersection costs,
and other costs normally paid by the City in special
assessment projects. When hard-surfaced, local streets in
rural subdivisions may utilize forty-five-inch P.C.C.P.
nonreinforced paving or five-inch hot mix asphaltic paving.
[2] Courts or lanes, which may utilize six-inch concrete,
provided that such courts or lanes remain in private or
private cooperative ownership. The subdivision agreement
and plat should clearly indicate that such streets are
private and are not subject to City maintenance or
acquisition.
(b) Street pavement thickness shall relate to the role of the street
in the hierarchy, subgrade conditions, and pavement type.
(2) Continuity of arterial or collector streets. No subdivision shall
prevent the extension of arterial or collector streets through and
beyond the subdivision. The subdivider may plan and design
collector streets not designated in the Comprehensive
Development Plan, subject to the approval of the City Council.
(3) Culs-de-sac.
(a) Cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently
closed generally should not exceed 600 feet in length and shall
be designed so that vision from entrance to end is not
restricted. A longer length is permissible within conservation
developments or in the case of unconventional developments,
such as golf course subdivisions.
(b) The closed end of a cul-de-sac within a conventional
subdivision shall have a turnaround with a street property line
diameter of at least 100 feet in residential subdivisions. This
diameter may be increased by the Planning Commission if
deemed necessary in the case of a commercial or industrial
subdivision. In very low density settings, the Planning
Commission may allow the use of hammerhead designs or
other nonstandard designs.
(4) Street grades. Maximum permitted street grades are set forth in
Table 40B.531 In typical circumstances, the minimum permitted
street gradient shall be 1.0%. In exceptional circumstances, the
Public Works Superintendent may permit street gradients of less
531. Editor's Note: Table 40B is included at the end of this article.

than 1.0%; however, under no circumstances may the gradient be
less than 0.4%.
(5) Street intersections.
(a) Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible,
unless limited by topography, existing street alignments, or
other clearly defined constraints.
(b) In most cases, no more than two streets should intersect at a
single intersection. Exceptions may be made within TND or
planned unit developments.
(c) Local streets shall minimize intersections with major arterials.
(d) New intersections along one side of an existing or proposed
street shall, if possible, align with intersections on the other
side of the street. Offsets between adjacent intersections shall
measure at least 150 feet between center lines. The use of Tintersections
is encouraged on local streets within the interior
of a subdivision.
(e) Intersection design standards are set forth in Table 40B.532
(6) Block size. The length, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be suited
to the proposed land use and design of the proposed subdivision.
Blocks within urban subdivisions shall not exceed 600 feet in
length, unless necessitated by exceptional topography or other
demonstrable constraints. Blocks within rural subdivisions shall
not exceed 1,320 feet.
(7) Specific design standards are established by the City of Seward's
Subdivision Design Manual.
(8) Other design standards shall be as set forth in Table 40D.533
A. All electric, telephone, television, cable TV, and other communication
lines shall be provided by underground wiring within easements or
public rights-of-way, except where, in the opinion of the approving
authorities, such location is not feasible. Poles for permitted overhead
lines shall be placed in rear lot line easements; or in other locations
designed to lessen their visual impact.
B. New lots adjacent to existing overhead service may utilize that service;
however, new local service connections shall be underground.
C. Year-round screening of any aboveground utility apparatus is required.
Screening shall be consistent with the landscape and screening

ARTICLE 41
Public Improvements and Infrastructure
§ 410-41.1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to assure that all subdivisions developed in the
City of Seward and its jurisdiction are adequately furnished with necessary
public services. These services include adequate water, wastewater
management, and stormwater drainage utilities; and park and open space
resources.
§ 410-41.2. Water.534
A. Connection.
(1) All installations shall be properly connected to an approved and
functioning community water system, constructed in conformance
with the applicable design standards of the City.
(2) All residential subdivisions inside of the corporate limits of Seward
shall be connected to an existing public water supply system if such
a system is available within 300 feet of the subdivision.
(3) Developments with more than 15 units and located within 0.5 mile
of an existing public water system must provide adequate
justification as to why they are unable to connect to such a system.
For developments with more than 15 units and located more than
0.5 mile from a public water supply, the water supply strategy shall
be considered by the approving authorities on a case-by-case basis.
(4) In a preexisting subdivision that is served by well and/or septic
systems that would otherwise require connection under the
provisions of this section, the Board of Adjustment may grant
permission to build on previously undeveloped lots of record,
subject to compliance with Title 124 of the Nebraska
Administrative Code, satisfactory percolation tests reviewed by the
Public Works Superintendent, and other applicable requirements.
(5) All proposals for new water supplies, extensions, or main
installation shall be approved by the City of Seward.
B. Capacity.
(1) The water supply system shall be adequate to handle the necessary
flow, based on complete development of the subdivision.
(2) The demand rates for all uses, including emergency fire demand,
shall be included in the computation of total water demand.
(3) Fire protection shall be furnished for any development connected
to the municipal water system. Computation of minimum fire flows
534. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 390, Water.
§ 410-41.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-41.2
1:961
shall be based on calculations of the American Insurance
Association.535
(4) Hydrants shall be spaced for necessary fire flow and provided with
adequate means of drainage as approved by the Public Works
Superintendent and Fire Chief. All mains serving hydrants shall be
at least eight inches in diameter, should be looping mains, and
should have appropriate state approvals. All fire hydrant leads shall
be a minimum of six inches in diameter.
(5) Installation of water systems shall conform to current design
standards in use within the City of Seward, as set forth by the
Subdivision Design Manual.
(6) A certification from a registered professional engineer shall be filed
with the City of Seward certifying that the water supply system of
the subdivision is designed and constructed in accordance with the
requirements of this section; and all applicable standards of the
State of Nebraska. This certification shall be affixed to an accurate
set of "as-built" system plans. The subdivision's engineer shall
furnish five sets of as-built drawings and one electronic file
compatible with the current version of AutoCAD®.
(7) All state requirements shall be met and approvals from the
Department of Health and Human Services Regulations and
Licensure Division shall be obtained for all water systems.
C. Private or community well systems. If the development does not meet
the required criteria for connection to a public water system or for
reasons of topography, economic feasibility, or other special condition
proposes water service by a community and/or private well, the
developer shall request a variance according to the following
provisions:
(1) The developer shall submit with the preliminary plat application an
economic feasibility study report and an environmental impact
study report, prepared by a professional engineer, which document
the cost of providing City water service to the subdivision versus
the cost of the proposed well system.
(2) If a well system is approved by the City with the preliminary plat
approval, the system shall be designed and built in accordance with
regulations of the Public Works Superintendent and the Nebraska
Department of Health and Human Services Regulations and
Licensure Division. Both agencies shall approve its construction
before the City issues certificates of occupancy for any buildings in
the subdivision.
(3) If a public water supply system is proposed to be provided to an
area within a ten-year period from the time of platting, as indicated
535. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).

§ 410-41.3. Sanitary sewers.536
in an officially adopted document of the City or other authorized
agency, the City may require installation of a capped system or dry
lines. Alternately, the City may require a payment in lieu of the
improvement, to be credited toward the extension and connection
of the subdivision to a future public water supply.
(4) City approval to install a community and/or private well system
shall be allowed, subject to the following additional provisions:
(a) The system, including all distribution lines, hydrants, valves,
and appurtenances, shall conform to current design standards
in use within the City of Seward and shall remain the property
of the developer and/or homeowners' association.
(b) The developer and all successive lot owners shall agree to
connect to the City water system if installed to the subdivision.
Such connection shall not be required for 10 years after the
date of construction of the initial well system.
(c) With connection to the City water system, all existing lot
owners shall be required to disconnect from and abandon the
preexisting well system in conformance with all local and state
standards and shall share equally in the cost of such
disconnection. Disconnection and abandonment shall be
completed within six months after connection to the City water
system.
A. Connection.
(1) All installations shall be properly connected to an approved and
functioning sanitary sewer system prior to issuance of a certificate
of occupancy.
(2) All residential subdivisions inside of the corporate limits of Seward
shall be connected to an existing public sanitary sewer system if
such a system is available within 300 feet of the subdivision.
(a) Developments with more than 15 units and located within 0.5
mile of an existing public sanitary sewer system must provide
adequate justification as to why they are unable to connect to
such a system. For developments with more than 15 units and
located more than 0.5 mile from a public sanitary sewer
system, the waste disposal strategy shall be considered by the
approving authorities on a case-by-case basis.
(b) In a preexisting subdivision that is served by well and/or septic
systems that would otherwise require connection under the
provisions of this section, the Board of Adjustment may grant
536. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 325, Sewers.
§ 410-41.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-41.3
1:963
permission to build on previously undeveloped lots of record,
subject to compliance with Title 124 of the Nebraska
Administrative Code, satisfactory percolation tests reviewed
by the Public Works Superintendent, and other applicable
requirements.
(3) If the City creates a benefit fund for the purpose of financing public
extensions of sanitary interceptor sewers to newly developing
areas, each subdivision to be benefited by such extensions shall
contribute to such a fund. Subdivisions within the City limits of
Seward at the time of platting, or subdivisions currently served by
existing sanitary sewer service, shall be exempt from this
requirement. Contributions to the fund shall be computed on the
basis of proportionate costs and benefits of necessary extensions.
Assessments shall be made on a per-lot basis for single-family
development; a per-unit basis for multifamily residential
development; and a site-area basis for nonresidential development.
(4) All proposals for new public sanitary sewer systems or extensions
of existing systems shall be approved by appropriate public
agencies.
(5) All state requirements shall be met and approvals from the
Department of Environmental Quality or other appropriate state
agencies shall be obtained for all wastewater disposal systems.
B. Capacity.
(1) The sanitary sewer system shall be adequate to handle the
necessary flow, based on complete development of the subdivision,
including peak flows.
(2) Installation of sanitary sewer systems shall conform to current
design standards in use within the City of Seward as set forth by
the Subdivision Design Manual.
(3) A certification from a registered professional engineer shall be filed
with the City of Seward certifying that the sanitary sewer system of
the subdivision is designed and constructed in accordance with the
requirements of this section; and all applicable standards of the
State of Nebraska. This certification shall be affixed to an accurate
set of "as-built" system plans. The subdivision's engineer shall
furnish five sets of as-built drawings and one electronic file
compatible with the current version of AutoCAD®.
C. Private wastewater disposal systems. If the development does not meet
the required criteria for connection to a public sanitary sewer system
and gravity sewer service connections, or if, for reasons of topography,
economic feasibility, or other special conditions, the developer proposes
service by a private wastewater disposal system, the developer shall
request a variance according the following provisions:
§ 410-41.3 SEWARD CODE § 410-41.3
1:964
(1) Subsurface or septic systems are not permissible on any lot created
after the effective date of this chapter if the gross density of the
subdivision is higher than one unit per 70,000 square feet; if
individual lots are smaller than one acre; or in any urban
subdivision.
(2) The developer shall submit with the preliminary plat application an
economic feasibility study report and an environmental impact
study report, prepared by a professional engineer, which document
the cost of providing City sewer service to the subdivision versus
the cost of the proposed private disposal system.
(3) The preliminary and final plat shall indicate the envelope for home
sites on each lot. Percolation tests must be done on areas outside
the envelopes of home sites. The preliminary plat application shall
also show the location of wells and septic fields for each lot and/or
for the subdivision as a whole, and shall submit percolation tests
for each lot, taken at the proposed adsorption field sites to
determine the size of the field required for each lot.
(4) The City shall consider all these submittals in determining whether
to permit installation of private wastewater disposal systems for
the subdivision.
(5) If a private wastewater disposal system is approved by the City
with the preliminary plat approval, the system shall be designed
and built in accordance with regulations of the Nebraska
Department of Environmental Quality and the City of Seward's
Subdivision Design Manual. The developer's professional engineer
shall furnish the City with five certified copies of as-built plans and
one electronic copy compatible with AutoCAD® showing service
line locations and final sewer and maintenance access locations,
lengths, elevations, and grades.
(6) If a sanitary sewer system is to be provided to an area within a tenyear
period, as indicated in an officially adopted document of the
City, the county, or other authorized agency, the City may require
installation of a capped system or dry lines. Alternately, the City
may require a payment in lieu of the improvement, to be credited
toward the extension to the subdivision of a future sanitary sewer
system.537
(7) City approval to install a community and/or private wastewater
disposal system shall be allowed, subject to the following additional
provisions:
(a) The system, including all sewer mains and appurtenances,
shall conform to current design standards in use within the
537. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 410-41.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-41.3
1:965
§ 410-41.4. Stormwater management.
City of Seward and shall remain the property of the developer
and/or homeowners' Association.
(b) The developer and all successive lot owners shall agree to
connect to the City sanitary sewer system if installed to the
corner of their lot. Such connection shall not be required for 10
years after the date of construction of the initial wastewater
system.
(c) With connection to the City sanitary sewer system, all existing
lot owners shall be required to disconnect from and abandon
the preexisting well system in conformance with all local and
state standards and shall share equally in the cost of such
disconnection. Disconnection and abandonment shall be
completed within six months after connection to the City sewer
system.
A. Design.
(1) All subdivisions shall have a stormwater management system that
is adequate to prevent the undue or unplanned retention of
stormwater on the site. Undue retention does not include:
(a) Retention through planned facilities.
(b) Retention not substantially different from preexisting
conditions.
(2) The design of the stormwater management system shall be
consistent with general and specific concerns and standards of the
Comprehensive Development Plan and the drainage control
programs of applicable public agencies. Design shall be based on
environmentally sound site planning and engineering techniques
and the City of Seward Stormwater Design Standards.
(3) To the maximum degree possible, drainage from subdivisions shall
conform to natural contours of land and not disturb preexisting
drainageways.
(4) Adjacent properties shall not be unduly burdened with surface
water from the subdivision. Specifically:
(a) There may be no unreasonable impediment of water from
higher adjacent properties across the subdivision, causing
damage to lower properties.
(b) No action shall unreasonably collect and channel stormwater
onto lower properties. The volume or rate of post-development
runoff shall not exceed the amount of pre-development runoff,
and is to be managed in a manner consistent with Nebraska
statutes and existing case law regarding such flows.
§ 410-41.3 SEWARD CODE § 410-41.4
1:966
§ 410-41.5. Parks and public facilities.
(5) Design shall use the best available technology to minimize off-site
runoff, encourage natural filtration, simulate natural drainage, and
minimize discharge of pollutants. Best available technology may
include retention basins, swales, porous paving, and terracing.
(6) No surface water may be channeled into a sanitary sewer system.
(7) Where possible, a subdivision's drainage system shall coordinate
with that of surrounding properties or streets.
(8) All stormwater design shall be reviewed and approved by the
Public Works Superintendent. The preliminary plat submission
must include preliminary drainage computations and
demonstrations that the proposed stormwater management system
meets the requirements of this section. A certification from a
registered professional engineer shall be filed with the City of
Seward certifying that the stormwater management system of the
subdivision is designed and constructed in accordance with the
requirements of this section; and all applicable standards of the
State of Nebraska. This certification shall be affixed to an accurate
set of "as-built" system plans.
B. Erosion control. With the submission of the preliminary plat, the
subdivider shall submit an erosion control plan, prepared and certified
by a licensed professional engineer, for any land-disturbing activity. All
grading activities must be carried out consistent with this approved
erosion control plan.
C. Seeding. The area of the plat, with the exception of street rights-of-way,
on which existing vegetation has been destroyed as a result of grading
shall be seeded with a seeding formula as approved by the City during
the first growing season immediately following the completion of
grading operations.
A. Purpose. In order to serve the educational and recreational needs of
new residents within the subdivision and promote the public health,
welfare, community character and property values, residential
subdividers are required to donate resources to make improvements to
the City of Seward's parks system as a condition of subdivision
approval.
B. Park reservations.
(1) General requirements.
(a) The amount of park facilities for new residents is partly based
on data and policy in the adopted City of Seward
Comprehensive Plan. The plans reflect a local adaptation of
standards of the National Recreation and Park Association
(NRPA). The Comprehensive Plan is the result of a system-wide
§ 410-41.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-41.5
1:967
technical analysis and citizen participatory planning process,
which identified near-term and long-range needs for the local
parks system.
(b) Given these findings, the City of Seward has determined the
following:
[1] Neighborhood park dedication. The City of Seward's
standard for neighborhood park service is two acres per
1,000 people. Consistent with this standard and the
Comprehensive Development Plan, a subdivision shall
dedicate for a neighborhood park up to 0.006 acre per
single-family detached dwelling unit and 0.004 acre per
unit for other types of housing. Alternately, the subdivider
shall pay a fee equivalent to the cost of 0.006 acre per
single-family detached dwelling unit and 0.004 acre per
unit for other types of housing, to be used specifically by
the City for the acquisition and development of park and
recreational facilities which directly benefit the
subdivision.
[2] Location. Land donated for new parks shall be located
based generally on the City's Comprehensive Development
Plan and Official Map and shall specifically consider the
design of each development and natural features present.
The amount of land required shall not include wetlands,
floodways, floodplains or stormwater detention facilities.
(2) Park donation substitutes. If parkland would be more appropriately
located off-site, the City Council may agree to accept cash in lieu of
land from a residential subdivider. The amount of land required
from a residential subdivider may be reduced depending on the
amount of the improved land, up to two acres established as a
private park by the subdivider, provided that such land is
determined to be of equivalent value and available by right to all
residents of the development. The subdivider shall present
evidence, through physical design and legal documentation, that
the private facility shall be equally available to all residents of the
development.
(3) Criteria for requiring a contribution of cash in lieu of park and
recreation land.
(a) General requirements. Where the subdivision is small and the
resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available
land is inappropriate for parks and recreation land use, or
when land for a park and recreation use cannot be made
contiguous to land dedication for a school site, the City Council
shall determine whether the subdivider shall be required to
pay a cash contribution in lieu of the required land donation.
§ 410-41.5 SEWARD CODE § 410-41.5
1:968
(b) Park accounting trust and use of fees. The cash contributions
in lieu of land for parks and recreation use shall be held in trust
by the City of Seward for expenditure by the City as
determined by the City Council. Such cash contributions shall
be used solely for the acquisition of land for parks and
recreation that will be available to serve the immediate or
future needs of the residents of the subdivision or
development, or for the improvement of recreation facilities
and other parks already existing which will benefit the
subdivision.
C. Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site and its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. A subdivider shall allow the City to have access to the
proposed sites for the purpose of conducting soil boring tests.
D. Timing and conveyance. Unless otherwise determined through a
subdivision agreement, a subdivider shall convey to the City (or such
other governmental body, corporation or such owner as determined by
the City) the land required under this section at the time of final
approval by the City Council of the subdivision or resubdivision plat or
final development plan, by the delivery of the following documents:
(1) A good and sufficient trustee's or warranty deed conveying fee
simple title free and clear of all liens and encumbrances (except
liens or encumbrances dischargeable by cash accompanying said
deed), except for current real estate taxes.
(2) A deposit of money equal to 100% of the most ascertainable taxes
for the year, pro-rated to the date that the deed is delivered.
(3) A plat of survey containing thereon the legal description of the
property to be conveyed and any other matters which may be
required by the City Administrator, as advised by the Zoning
Administrator, City Attorney, and the consulting Public Works
Superintendent.
E. Timing of payment. Cash contributions required under this section shall
be paid as follows:
(1) Fees paid prior to final plat.
(a) Unless otherwise provided by the terms of a developer
agreement entered into between the City and the subdivider,
all fees required pursuant to this section, including fees arising
from the development of land located in the City's two-mile
planning jurisdiction that may be subject to an
intergovernmental agreement, shall be due and owing prior to
the final plat approval by the City Council.
§ 410-41.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-41.5
1:969
§ 410-41.6. Easements.
(b) However, if the subdivider's lands are the subject of an
annexation agreement, payment shall be made at the times and
in the manner provided in said annexation agreement.
(2) Procedures for fee collection and administration. It shall be the
duty of the City Clerk, or other official designated by the City
Council, to establish regulations and procedures for the collection
and administration of the cash contributions required under this
section.
F. Development agreements.
(1) Development agreements may establish time and manner of
compliance. The City may enter into a development agreement with
any subdivider that sets forth the time and manner of compliance
with the terms of this section and implementation of any other
provisions of these regulations. Such development agreements may
be included as part of the subdivision agreement required for
subdivisions subject to the provisions of § 410-42.4.
(2) Prior development agreements.
(a) If any development agreement has previously been entered
into between the City and a subdivider, and that agreement
remains in full force and effect, the provisions of that
agreement shall control, and this section shall have no force
and effect, provided that the subdivider complies with the
terms of such agreement. However, if such subdivider is not
complying with the terms of that agreement, then the
provisions of this section shall apply and the City shall utilize
the criteria set forth herein to determine the appropriate
exaction amount, less credits, if any.
(b) Further, if the development contemplated by a subdivider has
either increased in number of units or has otherwise increased
the demand for park and recreation facilities, then the
developer agreement previously entered into between the
subdivider and the City shall be amended and the subdivider
shall provide additional land, or a pro-rata fee, based on the
provisions of this section, less credits, if any.
A. Utility easements.
(1) Urban subdivisions. Easements for utilities shall be provided for in
the subdivision dedication allowing for the construction,
maintenance, repair, and replacement of utilities. Such easements
shall be at least 15 feet in width, centered on the lot lines, and 10
feet in width along the rear property line where not adjacent to
additional lots, and shall be provided along:
§ 410-41.5 SEWARD CODE § 410-41.6
1:970
(a) All rear property lines.
(b) Side property lines where necessary to provide a continuous
easement. Easement requirements may be waived with proof
that such easements are not required by utility service
providers.
(2) Easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or
across lots. Easements of lesser width may be approved if accepted
by utility providers. Easements shall connect with easements on
adjoining properties.
(3) Easements shall be approved in writing by any appropriate public
or private utility provider intending to use such easement for their
facilities. Such approval shall be submitted prior to final plat
approval.
(4) Rural subdivisions. Easements for utilities shall be placed within
street rights-of-way, without requirements for additional utility
easements.
B. Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is crossed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel, or stream, a stormwater easement or drainage
right-of-way shall be provided. It shall correspond generally with the
extent of such watercourse, together with any additional construction
or expansion necessary to allow it to conduct stormwater adequately.
Easements shall extend not less than 20 feet on each side from the
center line of the waterway. The total width of any easement shall be
sufficient to cover the one-hundred-year floodplain calculated for a fully
developed upstream drainage basin. Parallel streets or parkways may
be utilized to preserve such drainageways.
C. Setback requirements for structures adjacent to creeks and
drainageways.
(1) In addition to other applicable provisions of City ordinances, no
persons shall be granted a permit for the construction of any
structure, exclusive of fences, bank stabilization structures, poles
signs, and non-related parking areas adjacent to any creek or
stream unless such structure is located so that no portion whereof
is any closer to the stream than will allow a maximum 3:1 slope
between the water's edge (during normal flow conditions) of the
stream and the closest point of the structure at-grade.
(2) An exemption from the provisions of Subsection C(1) above may be
granted if all of the following conditions are met and required
certification is filed with the City of Seward:
(a) Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that adequate bank stabilization structures or slope protection
will be installed in the construction of said structure, having an
estimated useful life equal to that of the structure, which will

1:971
§ 410-41.7. Dedications.
Before final plat approval is granted to the subdivision, dedications to public
use of all streets, alleys, other public rights-of-way, or other parks and
public lands shall be completed as required by this chapter.
provide adequate lateral support so that no portion of the
structure adjacent to the stream will be endangered by erosion
or lack of lateral support.
(b) Certification shall be affixed to an accurate set of "as-built"
construction plans for the structure, as well as "as-built" plans
of depicting any bank stabilization or slope protection
measures or structures.
(c) In the event that the structure is adjacent to any stream that
has been channelized or otherwise improved by any agency of
government, then such certification providing this exemption
must take the form of a certification as to the adequacy and
protection of the improvements installed by such governmental
unit.
D. Other easements. The subdivision shall provide easements for other
public utilities that cross through it, in a form acceptable to the City or
appropriate public agency.

§ 410-42.5. Subdivisions contiguous with City.
Unless otherwise provided as a specific part of the subdivision approval by
the City, all subdivisions now or hereafter laid out adjoining or contiguous
to the corporate limits of the City shall be included within such corporate
limits and become a part of the City of Seward. The residents of the
subdivision shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges and subject to
all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the City of Seward.
§ 410-42.6. Performance guarantees.
(h) An iron rod not less than 5/8 inch in diameter and 24 inches in
length as follows:

boundaries.
(i) Those costs required to be paid by the developer for extension
of water and sewer lines, pursuant to the Seward Municipal
Code.
(3) The subdivider, in lieu of installing and constructing said
improvements at his/her expense, may, along with all owners of
property to be affected by such improvements and all perfected lien
holders, petition the Council to cause the construction of such
improvements. This petition shall waive any required resolution of
necessity, any applicable limitations of the amount, which could be
assessed against subdivision property owners, including
intersection costs, and other costs normally paid by the City in
special assessment projects.
A. As a condition of the final approval of the plat and prior to its recording
with the Seward County Register of Deeds, the City Council shall
require and accept the following:
(1) The furnishing of a performance bond, letter of credit, cash escrow,
or other guarantee in a form acceptable to the City, in an amount
not to exceed 100% of the estimated cost of the improvement
installation.
(2) A specification of the time allowed for the installation of
improvements. This period may be extended by the City Council.
B. The performance guarantee amount and requirement, along with the

acceptance shall release the developer from liability pursuant to
the performance guarantee for the installation. The City has the
right to retain up to 10% of the value of the performance guarantee
for a period of up to one year from the date of acceptance to
remedy any deficiencies which appear during that period.
(3) If improvements are not accepted or not completed within the
specified time, the performance guarantee shall be forfeited and
used by the City to complete satisfactory installation of
improvements.
(4) No residential occupancy permits shall be issued for a subdivision
unless the installation of improvements has been inspected and

Nonconforming Development
ARTICLE 43
Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Uses
§ 410-43.1. Purpose.
The purposes of this article are:
§ 410-43.2. Applicability to uses and structures.
Regulations for nonconforming uses are in addition to regulations for
nonconforming structures. In the event of a conflict, the most restrictive
regulation shall apply.
§ 410-43.3. Nonconforming lots.
§ 410-43.4. Nonconforming structures.538
These regulations apply to buildings and structures that were constructed
legally under regulations in effect before the effective date of these
regulations or any amendments thereto making a structure nonconforming.
A. To allow for reasonable use of legally created lots of record that do not
meet current minimum requirements for their respective zoning
districts.
B. To provide for reasonable use of legally constructed structures that do
not meet current site development regulations for their respective
zoning districts.
C. To allow for the reasonable continuation of legally established uses that
do not meet current use regulations for their respective zoning
districts.
D. To limit the continuation and provide for the gradual replacement of
nonconforming uses.
A. Preexisting lots of record. Nonconforming lots of record existing at the
time of the adoption of this chapter shall be exempt, unless otherwise
provided, from the minimum lot area and lot width requirements of
each zoning district. Such lots may be developed with any use allowed
by the regulations for the district and must comply with all other site
development regulations set forth by the zoning regulations.
B. Reductions due to public acquisition. If a portion of a legally existing lot
in any district is acquired for public use, the remainder of this lot shall
be considered a conforming lot.

§ 410-43.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 410-43.4
1:977
A. Continuation. A lawful nonconforming structure existing on the
effective date of this section may be continued, repaired, maintained, or
altered, subject to the provisions of this section.
B. Additions or enlargements to nonconforming structures.
(1) A lawful nonconforming structure may be added to or enlarged if
the addition satisfies one or more of the following conditions:
(a) The enlargement or addition, when considered independently
of the existing building, complies with all applicable setback,
height, off-street parking, and landscaping requirements.
(b) The nonconforming building and impervious surface coverages
on the site are not increased and the building, after the
addition, conforms to height and off-street parking regulations
applicable to its zoning district.
(c) The addition projects no further into a required side yard
setback than the existing building; the length of the side wall of
the addition is the smaller of 25 feet or 50% of the length of the
existing nonconforming side wall; and the enlarged building
complies with building and impervious coverage, front and
rear yard setbacks, and height regulations applicable to its
zoning district.
(2) No permitted addition to a nonconforming structure may place a
wall within 10 feet of a window of an adjacent preexisting
residential structure.
(3) Nonconforming buildings shall be limited to one addition or
enlargement pursuant to these regulations.
C. Moving of nonconforming structures. A lawful nonconforming building
or structure shall not be moved in whole or in part to another location
on its lot unless every part of the structure conforms to all site
development regulations applicable to its zoning district.
D. Repair of nonconforming structures. A lawful nonconforming building
damaged by fire, explosion, storm or other calamity, except flood
damages, may be repaired and reconstructed, provided there is no
increase in the degree of nonconformity.
E. Conversion of a conforming building. A conforming building shall not be
changed in any way that will result in a nonconforming development.
F. Applicability of landscaping and screening regulations. A preexisting
structure, building, or development shall be exempt from Article 33,
Landscaping and Screening Standards. However, any expansion of such
structure, building, or development or any adjacent new development
onto property that is or becomes vacant on or after the effective date of
these regulations shall be subject to Article 33.

1:978
§ 410-43.5. Nonconforming uses.
A. Continuation of nonconforming uses.
(1) Any nonconforming use lawfully existing on the effective date of
these regulations may continue, subject to the limitations of this
section.
(2) Whenever the use of a premises becomes nonconforming through a
subsequent change in the Unified Land Development Ordinance or
zoning district boundaries, such use may be continued or changed
to another nonconforming use of the same or lesser intensity if
approved by the City Council at a public hearing following a public
hearing by the Planning Commission, including its
recommendation to the City Council.
B. Change of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use may be changed
to another nonconforming use of the same or lesser intensity, as
measured by the impact rating in the Use Matrix,539 provided an
application for such change is first approved by the City Council after
public hearing and recommendation of the Planning Commission.540
C. Enlargement of nonconforming uses. A building or structure housing a
lawful nonconforming use may not be added to or enlarged.
D. Abandonment of nonconforming use.
(1) If any structure or property used as a lawful nonconforming use
becomes vacant or unused for a continuous period of 12 months,
any subsequent use must conform to all use regulations applicable
to the property's zoning district.
(2) If a structure housing a nonconforming use converts to a
conforming use, it forfeits any further claim to nonconforming use
rights.
E. Allowance for repairs. Repairs and maintenance of a structure occupied
by a nonconforming use may be made, provided that no structural
alterations are made other than those required by law.
F. Damage or destruction of structures. Should a structure occupied by a
lawful nonconforming use be damaged to the extent that the cost of
restoration exceeds 60% of the replacement cost of the structure, the
nonconforming use shall no longer be permitted.
G. Nonconforming uses and conditional use permits. A lawful preexisting
use that requires a conditional use permit in its zoning district shall be
presumed to have the appropriate permit and shall be considered a
conforming use. The use shall be subject to the regulations governing
lapses or revocation of permits, set forth in Article 44.541

Administration And Enforcement
ARTICLE 44
Administrative Procedures and Penalties
§ 410-44.1. Purpose and scope.
The administration and procedures provisions establish the methods for
implementation of the Unified Land Development Ordinance. These
provisions include procedures for reviewing specific uses within certain
zoning districts; amending the zoning regulations; and granting variances.
§ 410-44.2. Site plan review.
A. Purpose. The site plan review procedure provides for the administrative
review, in addition to plan review required by other sections of the
Seward Municipal Code, of projects that have potentially significant
effects on traffic circulation or a significant effect on land uses in
adjacent neighborhoods. The procedure provides for review and
evaluation of site development features and possible mitigation of
unfavorable effects on surrounding property.
B. Administration. The Zoning Administrator or his/her designee shall
review, evaluate, and act on all site plans submitted pursuant to this
procedure. An applicant may appeal a denial of any application to the
Planning Commission and City Council.
C. Uses requiring site plan review. All uses indicated as subject to site plan
review in Table 44A542 are subject to the provisions of this section,
unless otherwise subject to a conditional use permit procedure for
specific zoning districts.543

parking and loading areas, pedestrian and vehicular access,
sewers, sidewalks, utilities, service areas, fencing, screening,
landscaping, and lighting.
(e) Location of any major site feature, including drainage and
contours at no greater than five-foot intervals.
(f) Any other information that may be required for review by the
Zoning Administrator or his/her designee.
E. Administrative action and appeal. The Zoning Administrator or his/her
designee must act upon each complete application within 10 working
days of filing. An applicant may appeal a denial to the Board of
Adjustment within 10 days of the action. The Board of Adjustment shall
consider the appeal at the first available meeting after the filing of the
appeal.
F. Review and evaluation.
(1) The Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee (or the Board of
Adjustment in cases of appeal), shall review and approve the site
plan based on the criteria established in Table 44A544 and
conformance with applicable regulations in these zoning
regulations.
(2) The Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee (or the Board of
Adjustment in cases of appeal), shall make the following findings
before approval of the site plan:
(a) The proposed development, together with any necessary
modifications, is compatible with the criteria established in
Table 44A.
(b) Any required modifications to the site plan are reasonable and
are the minimum necessary to minimize potentially
unfavorable effects.
(c) The site plan conforms to the zoning regulations.

§ 410-44.2 SEWARD CODE § 410-44.2
1:982
§ 410-44.3. Conditional use permits.546
G. Modification of site plan. The Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee
(or the Board of Adjustment in cases of appeal), may require
modification of a site plan as a prerequisite for approval. Required
modifications may be more restrictive than base district regulations
and may include, but not be limited to, additional landscaping or
screening; installation of erosion control measures; improvement of
access or circulation; rearrangement of structures on the site; or other
modifications deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety,
welfare, community character, property values, and/or aesthetics.
H. Term and modification of approval.
(1) A site plan approval shall become void two years after the date of
approval, unless the applicant receives a building permit and
diligently carries out development prior to the expiration of this
period.
(2) The Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee, may approve an
application to modify a previously approved site plan if he/she
determines that the modification does not affect findings related to
the criteria set forth in Table 44A.545
(3) The Zoning Administrator or his/her designee may revoke a site
plan approval if he/she determines that the development is not
complying with the terms and conditions of the approval. Such
revocation may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
I. Approval to run with land. An approval pursuant to this section shall
run with the land until the expiration date of such approval.
A. Purpose. The conditional use permit procedure provides for public
review and discretionary City Council approval for uses within zoning
districts which have unusual site development or operating

substantial detriment to adjacent property and the

of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably
practicable a general regulation to be adopted as an
amendment to these zoning regulations.

detriment to the public good and will not substantially
impair the intent and purpose of any ordinance or
resolution.

grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the
terms of these regulations in the district involved, or any
