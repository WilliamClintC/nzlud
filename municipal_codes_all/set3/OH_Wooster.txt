   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

widow, child or legal representative of the decedent.
   (c)   Before any payment is made, the claimant shall execute and deliver an

classified service shall be made to the Director of Administration upon forms
furnished by the Director.  Questions on the applications form must be
reasonably related to the duties required to be performed in the position.
 
   (b)   Minimum Qualifications.  Prior to the announcement of a vacancy in the
classified service, the Director shall prepare in writing the minimum
qualifications required for a vacant position.  The minimum qualifications
shall make reference to the following when required for a position: age,
education and experience, licenses and certificates, physical condition,
criminal history, polygraph testing, psychological test.  All required
qualifications must be reasonably related to the duties required to be
performed in the position, and shall not be used to unlawfully discriminate.
   A copy of such minimum qualifications shall be provided to the Civil Service
Commission.  The minimum qualifications must be made a part of the announcement
of the vacancy.  Following publication of the announcement, no reduction or
modification in the minimum qualifications shall be performed.
   All applicants must be citizens of the United States and meet the minimum
requirements for a position as stated in the announcement, except when
necessary to under fill a promotional position as provided in Section 133.09
(a).  All applicants for permanent, full-time positions must be at least
eighteen years old, except for police officers, who shall be twenty-one to
thirty-five years of age, and firefighters, who shall be twenty-one to thirty-
five years of age, inclusive at the date of appointment.  All applicants

by any applicant.  Whenever the Director finds that an applicant fails to meet
minimum qualifications stated on the announcement; or has been found guilty of
a job-related criminal offense; or has been dismissed from employment for
inefficiency, delinquency or misconduct; or has resigned from employment while
disciplinary charges were pending; or is addicted to the habitual or excessive
use of habit forming drugs or intoxicating beverages; or has made false
statement on the application; or has otherwise demonstrated a lack of integrity
or responsible behavior, the Director may reject the application.
   The applicant may appeal the rejection to the Commission within five working
days from the date of the notice of rejection.
(Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.04  EXAMINATIONS.
   (a)   Examinations.  All original appointments, lateral hires, and
promotions in the classified service shall be filled according to merit and
fitness, to be ascertained, as far as practical, by competitive examination.
   The Director of Administration shall have the responsibility for reviewing
the applications and testing applicants.
 
   (b)   Announcements.  When the Director determines that a vacancy exists
that must be filled in an authorized position in the classified service, and no
valid eligible list exists for such position, the Director shall establish the
date and the type of examination that will be given for the position.
   For all examinations, except promotional examinations, the Director shall
announce the vacancy by placing an advertisement in a local newspaper of
general circulation or electronically publishing, and in other publications as
necessary, for three successive days.
   Notification of the vacancy shall also be sent to the Civil Service
Commission and all City departments to be posted in a conspicuous location in
the Municipal Building.
   Each classification vacancy shall be advertised in a separate announcement. 
Multiple vacancies in one classification may be combined into one announcement.
   The Director may announce a combined open and promotional examination when
three or fewer qualified promotional candidates are available for an
examination.  The examination shall be advertised as provided herein.
   Promotions of sworn officers in the Police and Fire Divisions shall be made
only as specified in Section
133.09.  Promotional positions, except sworn officers in the Police and Fire
Divisions, may be provisionally under filled as provided in Section
133.09(a).
   When a position requires exceptional qualifications of a scientific,
managerial, professional or educational nature, or where a particular applicant
has unusual qualifications for a vacant position based on exceptional skills,
education or experience, the Director may determine that it is not practicable
to give a competitive examination.  In such cases the Director may approve the
appointment of a person of recognized attainment, providing satisfactory
evidence can be presented to the Commission showing that the designated person
is exceptionally qualified and that competition would therefore be impractical.
 
   (c)   Examination Methods.  Examination methods shall consist of one or more
of the following tests, as determined by the Director:
      (1)   Written tests of aptitudes, achievement and knowledge of the work. 
The test may include an objective type examination designed to test the
applicant's familiarity with information and material which could reasonably be
expected in the position; standard intelligence tests; standard aptitude tests;
or a dissertation on one or more subjects dealing with problems encountered in
the classification.
      (2)   Written tests which evaluate mental fitness, character traits and
attitudes, provided such tests are related to the duties of the position
sought.
      (3)   Ratings which evaluate education, training and/or experience
pertinent to the classification for which the examination is taken.
      (4)   Performance or skill tests which provide for assessment of
applicant's abilities and manual skills to perform the work involved in the
classification.
      (5)   Physical examinations consisting of muscular strength, agility,
endurance and coordination of applicants.
      (6)   Oral examinations which evaluate knowledge, personal
qualifications, and communications skills, provided such tests or ratings are
practical, competitive and related to duties of the position sought.
 
   (d)   Conduct of Examinations.  All examinations shall be conducted under
the supervision of the Director of Administration who may designate or contract
on behalf of the Civil Service Commission for special examiners as required. 
Written examinations shall be prepared, graded and the results certified by a
university or other qualified testing service, and contracts for such written
examinations shall be approved by the Commission.
   No applicant shall be admitted to any written examination after any
applicant who has seen the questions has withdrawn from the examination room.
   Visitors or observers shall not be admitted to the examination room during
any examination except by permission of the Director.  The Director may provide
for assistance for handicapped applicants who are otherwise qualified.  Such
assistance shall be limited to reading the examination and/or marking the
answers as directed by the applicant.
   Any applicant who, during an examination, attempts to aid himself or another
applicant in answering questions by reference to notes or other material not
approved for use by all applicants, or by discussion with other applicants, or
by other means of cheating, shall be dismissed from such examination and shall
receive no grade.
   Examinations shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   Written examinations shall be administered to all applicants on the
date advertised.  Prior to the start of the examination, each applicant shall
complete and sign an identification card containing a number the applicant must
use to identify the examination form and answer sheets, and other such
information as required.  The identification cards shall be sealed in a blank
envelope and delivered to the Commission, who shall use the numbers to identify
and rank the test scores.  The identity of the person taking the test shall be
concealed from the examiners by the use of the identification number by the
applicant on the examination form and answer sheet.
      (2)   An unassembled test which involves the evaluation of education,
experience and training of applicants shall use a consistent standard of
ranking the qualifications of all applicants.
      (3)   Performance tests shall involve similar tasks for all applicants
competing for the same position, and shall be related to the actual duties and
responsibilities of the position.  This type of examination shall be
administered by someone designated by the Director who is familiar with the
skills required in the position,
      (4)   Physical examination shall involve similar physical fitness
activities for all applicants, and shall be related to the duties and
responsibilities of the position.
      (5)   Oral examination shall involve similar questions for all applicants
related to the duties and responsibilities of the position.  This examination
shall be administered by two or more individuals, one of whom may be the
Director, or one or more persons selected by the Director familiar with the
position.  The two examiners shall average their scores to determine a final
score for the applicant.
 
   (e)   Postponement and Cancellation of Examinations.  The Director of
Administration shall have the right to postpone any examination because of an
inadequate number of applications, because of non-attendance of special
examiners, or for other sufficient cause, or to cancel any examination, the
holding of which becomes unnecessary because of change in the personnel
requirements of the City.  All postponements or cancellations shall be approved
by the Civil Service Commission.
 
   (f)   Grading of Examinations.  All examinations shall be graded or ranked
by the examiner and the results certified to the Commission.  Written
examinations shall be graded by statistical methods which proportion and
convert individual scores on a scale where 100% represents the highest possible
attainment and 65% represents the minimum level of attainment.  Non-written
examinations shall use a consistent passing mark representing the minimum
performance level for each examination.  In order to attain place on the
eligible list, an applicant's final grade average from all tests must be no
less than 65% for written examinations or the minimum performance level on non-
written examinations.  However, the Director, with the approval of the
Commission, may require at least 65% in some specific part of an examination as
published in the announcement, and the failure of the candidate to make such
required 65% in that part of the examination will disqualify the applicant in
the entire examination.
   The weights of the various parts of each examination shall be determined by
the Director and shall be applied uniformly in determining each applicant's
final grade.
   An applicant who has served in the Armed Forces, Reserve, National Guard, or
other Uniformed Services of the United States and has been honorably
discharged, shall receive five points credit in addition to the test score.
Veteran credit points shall not be added until a passing grade is obtained by
the applicant. Veteran credit points shall not apply to any promotional or
unassembled examination.
   Police officer applicants shall receive two and one-half points credit in
addition to the test score for an Associate's Degree or five points additional
credit for a Bachelor's Degree.  Applicants shall receive one-half point credit
for each year of part-time service in their respective divisions.
 
   (g)   Repeating Examinations.  No person who has failed to pass an
examination shall be permitted to be re-examined for the same classification
within six months of the date of the previous examination.  However, the
Director may, if the examination is determined to be unfair or unjust, permit
person who have failed an examination to be re-examined before the expiration
of the six month period, but in no case prior to sixty days from the date of
such failure.  When such re-examination occurs, physical examinations need not
be repeated, but rather the applicant's score in the previous examination may
be used.  Applicants disqualified and removed from an eligible list because of
an unsatifactory background investigation may repeat an examination for the
same classification after three years from date of disqualification.
 
   (h)   Inspection of Examination Papers by Candidates.
      (1)   All selection and grading devices and examination papers are the
property of the City, and shall be treated as confidential  records to the
maximum extent possible under law.
      (2)   Upon receiving notification of the examination grade, applicants
may review the keyed copy of the written examination and their own answer
sheet, which is identified by their number received during the examination. 
The criteria and standards used for non-written examinations may also be
reviewed during the period herein provided.  This review must be requested
within five days exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, from the date of
mailing the applicant's notification of the examination grade.  Review must
take place in the presence of the Director or a person designated by the
Director.  Notetaking in regard to the exam content shall not be permitted.  If
the applicant believes a clerical error has been made, a request for the
correction shall be made to the Director.  The scoring by the examiners shall
be deemed prima facie correct.  No examination paper or any part thereof shall
be subject to alteration, addition or deletion by the applicant except that any
manifest error of scoring may be corrected by the Director.  Additional testing
procedures or investigation may continue during the time period provided for
review.
      (3)   Any applicant who exercises the right to inspect examination papers
shall not be permitted to take an examination for the same classification
within six months of the inspection, unless a totally different examination
form is used.
 
   (i)   Preservation of Examination Papers.  Applicants and examination papers
of all candidates for employment shall be kept on file in the office of the
Director for at least one year.
(Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.05  ELIGIBLE LISTS.
   (a)   Establishment of Eligible List.  The scores or final standing of each
applicant shall be provided to the Civil Service Commission at the completion
of the examination.  From the returns of each competitive examination, the
Director shall prepare an eligible list of the persons whose grades in the
examination are not less than sixty-five percent or who meet the minimum
performance level and who are otherwise eligible.  The eligible list shall be
established in the order of scores or ratings, with the highest score or rating
being at the top of the list, and the lowest score or rating being at the
bottom of the list.  The grade of any applicant failing to qualify shall not be
made public.
   In an open competitive or lateral examination for original appointment, if
two or more applicants receive the same grade, priority in time of filing the
application shall determine the order in which their names shall be placed on
the eligible list.
   As soon as the grading and rating of an examination have been completed and
an eligible list is established, all applicants shall be notified in writing of
their individual score or rating, and if successful, of the applicant's final
average and related position on the eligible list.
 
   (b)   Duration of Eligible List.  An eligible list shall be in effect for
one year from the date on which it is established by the Director provided,
however, that any list that has been reduced to less than three names may be
abolished at any time by the Director, except when such eligibility list
consists of persons laid-off from the classification for which the eligible
list exists.  The Director of Administration may request an extension of the
eligible list up to six additional months or request that the Commission
abolish the eligible list after six months.
 
   (c)   Causes for Removal from Eligible List.  The Director may at any time
remove the name of an applicant from any eligible list for any one or more of
the following causes:
      (1)   Failure of applicant to reply to notice of certification within the
time limit of such notice, unless reasons are presented that satisfy the
Director.
      (2)   Rejection of the applicant for any of the causes listed in Section
133.03 (c).

inaccurate.
   Reinstatement to an eligible list may be requested by the applicant in
writing to the Commission within thirty days after notification of removal. 
Upon approval by the Commission, the name of such person shall be restored to
the eligible list in a position determined by the grade obtained by the
applicant on the examination.
   A person certified from an eligible list more than three times for the
classification, and is not appointed, may be omitted from future certification
from that classification.
 
   (d)   Change in Address.  Applicants shall notify the Director in writing of
any changes in address while their names remain on the eligible list.
(Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.06  CERTIFICATION.
   (a)   Certification from Eligible List.  Upon receipt of an eligible list
for a classification, the Civil Service Commission shall certify to the
Director of Administration the names of the three persons standing highest on
the eligible list.  When more than one vacancy is to be filled in a
classification, the Commission shall certify the number of names equal to the
number of vacancies to be filled and three more in addition thereto; provide,
however, that a few number may be certified when there is not the required
number on the eligible list.  No person shall be certified from a promotional
eligible list while permanently separated from employment by the City.
 
   (b)   Placement of Lay-Offs on Eligible List.  When any regular appointee is
laid off, the name of such person shall be placed at the top of the eligible
list for the classification from which the employee is laid off.  If there is
no existing list at the time, the name of such person shall constitute one. 
When two or more person have been laid off, whether at the same time or not,
their names shall be placed at the top of such eligible list in the order of
their appointment in the classification held by them when laid off.  Such
persons shall be eligible for certification and reappointment for a period of
two years thereafter.
 
   (c)   Waiver of Certification.  An eligible may waive certification by
notification to the Director.  A waiver of certification shall remain in effect
until withdrawn, at which time the eligible is reinstated to the position
originally held on the eligible list.  A waiver may not exceed six months and
may not be used more than two times.  After two waivers, or after six months
have passed on a waiver, the eligible name shall be removed from the eligible
list.  Whenever one or more of the eligible who have been certified waive
certification or fail to respond to notice of certification, the Commission
shall supplement the certification from the eligible list by an equal number of
additional names.
 
   (d)   Objection.  If the Director objects to the certification of any
eligible, the specific reasons for the objection shall be given in writing to
the Commission.  Any cause contained in Section
133.03 (c) shall be deemed sufficient reason for objection, but the Commission
may approve objection for other causes.  The person against whom objection is
made may be granted a hearing by the Commission, at which time the Director may
present the objection.  If the objection is sustained by the Commission, the
next highest name on the eligible list shall be certified. 
(Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.07  APPOINTMENTS.
   (a)   Investigation of Eligibles.  Upon the establishment of an eligible
list, the Director of Administration may conduct or authorize an investigation
as to whether the eligible possess the necessary standards of health, physical
attributes and mental soundness necessary to perform the duties and
responsibilities of the position sought.  The eligible may be investigated
prior to certification.
   The investigation may include physical fitness examination,  and
psychological examination, polygraph examination, background investigation,
personal interview or any other method necessary to ascertain the
qualifications and ability of the applicant.
   If the eligible is found during the investigation to be unqualified or
unsuitable for the position, such person may be removed from the eligible
list.  Upon notification to the Civil Service Commission of such rejection and
the reasons thereof, an additional name shall be certified to replace each
eligible removed.
   The person against whom objection is made may appeal such rejection to the
Commission within five days after mailing such notification.
 
   (b)   Permanent and Promotional Appointments.  After certification of the
eligible by the Commission to the Director, the Director shall recommend to the
Mayor the name or names of persons to be appointed or promoted from the
eligible list.  The Mayor may follow the recommendation of the Director, or may

promotions may only be made to authorized positions.
 
   (c)   Temporary Appointments.  Part-time and temporary employees may be
appointed by the Mayor, by non-competitive examination, from a list maintained
by the Director for such positions.  The Commission shall be notified in
writing of all such appointments.

exists for the position, the Mayor may make a provisional appointment to that
position.  Prior to such appointment the Director shall notify the Commission. 
In no case shall a provisional appointment continue longer than 180 days, or
until an appropriate eligible list is established, whichever occurs first.
 
   (e)   Emergency Appointment.  In time of extreme emergency that poses a
threat to public health, safety or welfare, and it is necessary to employ one

qualified person or persons during the period of emergency, but in no such case
for a period exceeding fifteen days.
   Emergency appointments, with the reasons therefor, shall be reported to the

within three days.  The Commission may inquire into the nature of the emergency
and reject the appointment if it is found that no emergency existed.

      (6)     The Civil Service Commission is authorized to promulgate rules
and regulations for the administration of the test and selection methodology
not inconsistent with this section.
         (Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.08  PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   (a)   Purpose.  The probationary period shall be regarded as an integral
part of the examination process and shall be used for closely observing the
employee's work, for securing the most effective adjustment of a new employee
to a new job and for dismissing any employee whose performance does not meet
required work standards.
 
   (b)   Probation.  Permanent original appointments to the classified service,
except classified service with the Division of Police, shall serve a one year
probationary period from the date of such appointment.  For permanent original
appointments to the classified service in the Division of Police, a
probationary period shall begin the first day of employment and end one year
following the first day of field training.  A probationer may be discharged
without cause at any time within the probationary year.
   All permanent promotional appointments in the classified service shall serve
a probationary period of one year from the date of such promotion.  If during
that period the service of the employee so appointed is not satisfactory, the
employee may be reduced to the position from which the promotion was made.
   No permanent appointment or promotion shall be deemed final until the
appointee has satisfactorily served the probationary period.
 
   (c)   Probation Reports.  All classified employees shall be evaluated in
writing during their probationary period.  The employee's supervisor shall
prepare and transmit to the Director of Administration an evaluation of the
performance of the probationary employee upon a form approved by Council.  A
probationary employee, upon request, shall be entitled to a copy of such
evaluation.
   For original permanent appointees, a report shall be completed quarterly
after the commencement of the probationary period, with the final report
completed five days prior to the expiration of the probationary period. 
Promotional appointees shall be evaluated ten days prior to the expiration of
their probationary period.
 
   (d)   Absence During Probationary Period.  Whenever a probationary employee
is granted a leave of absence, sick leave or is laid off, suspended for
discipline purposes, or is otherwise absent from work, the length of the
probationary period shall be extended the length of such absence.  Upon return
to duty following such absence, such employee shall be required to service the
unexpired portion of the probationary period.
(Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.09  PROMOTIONS.
   (a)   Method of Filling Vacancies.  Vacancies in authorized positions above
the lowest classifications in the classified service shall be filled, as far as
practicable, by promotions.  All promotional ranks within the Division of
Police and Division of Fire shall be filled by promotion, except as otherwise
provided in the Charter or these Codified Ordinances.  In regard to all other
positions, the Director of Administration shall in each case determine whether
or not it is practicable to fill a position by promotion, and from what
classification or classifications such promotion shall be made and the type of
examination to be used for the promotion.  The Director may authorize a single
combined open and promotional examination for the same position.
   Eligibility for a promotional examination shall be limited to permanent
employees who have satisfactorily completed their probationary period in a
designated class or classes, and have received a satisfactory rating average on
the last two most recent evaluation reports.
   However, when an open examination will be given for a promotion, employees
serving their probationary year in another position may take the open
examination.  If such employee is certified and receives the promotion, the
employee's probationary period in the new position shall be the greater of
ninety days from the date of promotion, or the balance of the probationary year
dated from the time of original appointment with the City.
   When a vacancy in a promotional position has been announced, and an
insufficient number of qualified applicants are available for either an open or
promotional examination, then, with the approval of the Commission, such
promotional position may be under filled by provisionally appointing to the
position a City employee who has less than the minimum qualifications for the
position.  During the provisional period, the employee shall receive training
for the position.
   At the completion of the provisional period, the employee shall receive
permanent promotion upon passing a promotional examination, or demonstrating to
the satisfaction of the Commission, that the employee is qualified for the
promotion.
 
   (b)   Promotional Examinations in Police and Fire Divisions.  All regular
sworn members of the Fire Division above the rank of firefighter, who have
completed five years of service as a regular sworn members, may take the
examination for Chief. All regular sworn members of the Police Division, in the
job classifications of Lieutenant, Captain and Assistant Chief, may take the
examination for Chief. In addition, the Mayor may nominate two additional
candidates to take the examination for Chief in each division.  Except for the
position of Chief of each division, no position above the rank of firefighter
and patrolman in their respective divisions shall be filled by original
appointment.
      (1)   When a vacancy occurs among sworn officers in the Fire Division, it
shall be filled by promotional examination which shall be open to persons
employed within the division as follows: lieutenants with at least three years'
service in addition to the required one year probationary period shall be
eligible for the examination for assistant chief.  Regular firefighters with at
least five years' service in addition to the required one year probationary
period shall be eligible for the examinations for assistant chief and/or
captain.  Regular firefighters with at least two years' service in addition to
the required one year probationary period shall be eligible to take the
examination for lieutenant.  Whenever such promotional examinations are given,
lieutenants shall be eligible to take the examination for captain; captains
shall be eligible to take the examination for assistant chief.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, two or more persons who are
eligible are required to take the promotional examination for the examination
to be deemed competitive.
   When a vacancy occurs among sworn officers in the Police Division, it shall
be filled by promotional examination which shall be open to persons employed
within the Division.
   Police officers, who have successfully completed the one year initial
probationary period, shall be eligible to take the examination for sergeant.
Police Officers and Sergeants, who have successfully completed the probationary
period, shall be eligible to take the examination for Lieutenant. Police
Officers, Sergeants and Lieutenants, who have successfully completed the
probationary period, shall be eligible to take the examination for Captain.
Captains and Lieutenants, who have successfully completed the probationary
period, shall be eligible to take the examination for Assistant Chief. 
 
   (c)   Unassembled Promotional Examinations.  Whenever there are three or
less eligible City employees to compete in a promotional examination, an
unassembled examination may be given to the applicants to determine their
ranking on the eligible list.  In exceptional cases, the Commission may
authorize the promotion of an eligible employee upon presentation of
satisfactory evidence that competition is impractical.
   Promotional examinations in the Police and Fire Division shall be conducted
only according to Section
133.09(b).
 
   (d)   Grading of Promotional Examinations.  Promotional examinations shall
be graded in accordance with Section
133.04 (f).  The candidate's final score shall be determined by adding
seniority credit points and/ or higher education credits to the total
examination score.  No candidate shall receive more than a maximum of seven and
one half points for higher education and/or senority credits combined.
 
   (e)   Seniority credit may be given at a rate of one half point credit for
each year of continuous service with the City, up to a maximum of seven and one
half points. In promotional examinations for sworn officers of the Police and
Fire Divisions, credit for seniority shall be based only on service in the
Police and Fire Divisions, respectively.
 
   (f)   Higher education credits for promotional candidates may be given at a
rate of two and one half points credit for an Associate's Degree in a related
field or five points credit for a Bachelor's Degree in a related field.  For
Police promotional candidates, higher education credits will only be considered
after two years of full-time service.
   Efficiency credit shall not be a factor in determining the final score,
except that a satisfactory average of the two most recent evaluation reports in
the employee's class is necessary to be eligible to take a promotional
examination.
   When a tie exists after calculation of the final score, including seniority
and higher education credits, then seniority in the classification from which
the promotion is sought shall determine the order of the scores.  If a tie
still exists, then the final score by which the applicants obtained the
classification from which the promotion is sought shall determine the order of
the scores. 
(Ord.  2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.10  UNSKILLED SERVICE.
   (a)   Unskilled Positions. Pursuant to Section

   (b)   Original Appointments to Unskilled Positions. When a vacancy in an
unskilled classification is to be filled by original appointment, such position

Director of Administration. The Director shall evaluate the applications and
give tests as necessary to determine the qualifications of such applicants. A
priority list of applicants shall be compiled by the Director, a copy of which
shall be submitted to the Civil Service Commission, from which appointments
shall be made.
 
   (c)   Promotional Appointments to Unskilled Positions. Promotions into
unskilled positions as listed in Section
133.10 (a) shall be made as provided in Section
133.09 , except that competitive examinations need not be used to establish the
eligible list. The Director shall evaluate the applications and give tests as
necessary and appropriate to determine the qualifications of the applicants. A
priority list of applicants shall be compiled by the Director, a copy to which
shall be submitted to the Commission, from which the promotions shall be made.
(Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.11  TRANSFERS, LEAVES OF ABSENCE AND RESIGNATIONS.
   (a)    Transfers. Except for sworn officers of the Police and Fire
Divisions, the Director of Administration may transfer any employee from the
position held to a like position in the  same or another division. In addition,
any employee may request transfer to a like position in another division,
conditional upon the approval of the Director and the head of the division to
which the employee wishes to be transferred .
 
   (b)   Leaves of Absence. A leave of absence without pay for cause may be
granted by the Director for a definite period not to exceed one year, provided
that the absence does not disrupt City operations. Such leaves shall be without
pay or benefits, except as authorized by the Director.
   Leaves of absence may be granted for physical disability, for study or
training of value to public service, for maternity leave, or for any other
purpose approved by the Director.
A request for leave of absence shall be presented to the Director in writing at
least twenty days' prior to the start of the leave, unless the Director
consents to a shorter notice.
   Holiday pay, sick leave, hospitalization, vacation, seniority and other
benefits shall not accrue during leave of absence.
   Failure to return to work on schedule from a leave of absence shall be
considered a resignation.
 
   (c)   Resignation.  Any employee in the classified service who desires to
resign in good standing shall give a written notice to the employee's division
head at least two weeks prior to the date the employee intends to leave, unless
the division head consents to a shorter period. Then the division head approves
such request, it shall be forwarded to the Director, who shall in turn notify
the Civil Service Commission.
   If an employee has been served with a dismissal notice, and such notice has
been filed with the Commission, and the employee thereupon resigns, the
acceptance of the resignation constitutes resignation in bad standing. The
charges pending shall be deemed withdrawn and the proceeding shall be dismissed
without judgment. The resignation shall be effective immediately and the
employee may not be reinstated.
 
   (d)   Reinstatement.  At the discretion of the City, any employee in the
classified service who has resigned in good standing may, within one year of
the effective date of such resignation, request from the Director in writing
reinstatement to the position from which the employee resigned. Upon approval
of the Director, the employee's former division head and the Commission, if a
vacancy exists, the employee may be reinstated to the classification from which
the employee resigned. If no vacancy exists, the name of the employee may be
placed at the top of the eligible list for the classification from which the
employee resigned. If no eligible list exists, such persons named shall
constitute an eligible list. However, where such eligible list includes the
names of laid off employees, the laid off employees shall take priority over
employees who have requested reinstatement.  In the uniformed ranks of the
Police and Fire Divisions, reinstatement shall be to the position of patrolman
or firefighter, regardless of the former position held.
 
   (e)   Absence Without Leave.  Absence from duty without authorized leave for
three consecutive work days shall constitute resignation in bad standing.
However, if within three days of the effective date of such resignation the
employee submits sufficient evidence explaining that the employee was
physically or mentally unable to notify the Director or his supervisor, the
Director may authorize reinstatement. For this subsection (e), "work day" means
the days the employee is regularly scheduled to work.
   This section does not preclude discipline or dismissal action for a shorter
period of absence of sufficient seriousness.
(Ord. 2017-26.  Passed 9-18-17.)
   133.12  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.
   The Director of Administration shall require supervisors to complete

after it has been signed by the employee.
   When the evaluation report has been marked, reviewed and signed, a copy
shall be furnished to the employee, a copy shall be retained in the employee's
department, and the original shall be sent to the Director.
   Any permanent employee who receives a performance rating average of less
than satisfactory shall have ten days from receipt of notice thereof to file an
appeal with the Civil Service Commission setting forth supporting facts and
evidence that the performance rating was not properly determined. The Director
shall, prior to the Commission hearing, inquire of the employee, the employee's
supervisors, and the appointing authority with respect to the appeal, and
submit a report of findings to the Commission. The Commission may amend a
performance rating that averages less than satisfactory if it ascertains that
the rating was determined arbitrarily or totally without regard to actual
performance. In the event an employee is rejected for promotional examination
due to a less than satisfactory service rating average for the rating year
preceding the examination and the ten day appeal time has not expired, the
employee must file the performance rating appeal within five days of the
receipt of the rejection notice, in order to be granted conditional acceptance
to the examination pending the consideration of the appeal by the Commission.
In the event the Commission amends the employee's performance rating to the
extent necessary to qualify for the promotional examination, the examination
will be graded and if a final passing grade is obtained, the employee's name
will be merged to the eligible list. Such employee shall be eligible for
certification thereafter in accordance with the eligible list.

force in a classification in any division of the City, the Director shall lay
off employees inversely in order of seniority credit. No layoffs shall be
affected or influenced by politics, religion, sex or race, and no layoffs shall
be used as a substitute for disciplinary action.

examination passed to obtain such classification . The employee with the lowest
grade shall be laid off first.
   Any permanent employee who has been promoted and is subject to layoff shall
be entitled to return to the position from which the employee was promoted. If
such former position has been filled, the employee in that position shall be
demoted into the lower position occupied prior to the promotion. This process
shall continue until the most recently hired employee affected by such
demotions shall be laid off.
 
   (c)   Seniority Credit.  Seniority credit shall be the amount of continuous
service an employee has accumulated in the service of the City, according to
the following rules:

probationary employee and who has achieved permanent status with no
interruption in service shall receive seniority credit for the continuous
service during the period served as a temporary or probationary employee.
      (2)   Part-time employees shall have their continuous service pro-rated
as it relates to full-time when determining seniority credit for layoff
purposes.
      (3)   Any leave without pay other than sick leave, injury leave or
military leave shall be subtracted when computing the continuous service of an
employee for purposes of determining seniority credit.
      (4)   The continuous service of a permanent employee who has resigned and
been re-instated shall be computed from the time of the last reinstatement and
no seniority credit shall accrue for service prior thereto.
 
   (d)   Re-employment List.  When any permanent employee is laid off, the name
of such person shall be placed at the top of the eligible list of the
classification from which the employee was laid off. If there is no existing
eligible list at the time, the name shall constitute one. When two or more
persons have been laid off, whether at the same time or not, their names shall
be placed at the top of such eligible list in the order of their appointment in
the classification held by them when laid off.
   Such persons shall be eligible for certification and reemployment for a
period of two years thereafter, or, if sooner, until such time as the employee
is removed from the eligible list for the reasons provided in Section
133.05(c).

following characteristics:
      (1)    Maintains offices and operating facilities in this City and
transacts business in this City;
      (2)    Employs less than two thousand five hundred employees in this
City, the majority of whom are residents of this County;
   (b)    "Eligible lending institution" means a financial institution that is
eligible to make commercial loans, is a public depository of State funds under
Ohio R.C. 135.03 and agrees to participate in the Linked Deposit Program.
   (c)    “Linked deposit”  means a certificate of deposit placed by the
Director of Finance with an eligible lending institution at up to three percent
(3%) below current market rates (the “discount rate”), as determined and
calculated by the Director of Finance, provided the institution agrees to lend
the value of such deposit according to the deposit agreement provided in
Section
159.05(c) to eligible businesses at the present borrowing rate applicable to
each specific business at the time of the deposit of City funds in the
institution, less the discounted rate of the certificate of deposit so placed.
      (Ord. 2008-24.  Passed 8-18-08.)
   159.02  PURPOSE.
   Council finds that some businesses throughout the City are experiencing
economic stagnation or decline, that interest rates have caused businesses in
this State to suffer disproportionately in profitability and competition.  The
Linked Deposit Program provided for in this chapter is intended to provide
Citywide availability of lower cost funds for lending purposes that will
materially contribute to the economic revitalization of this City. Accordingly,
it is declared to be the public policy of the City through the Linked Deposit
Program to create an availability of lower-cost funds to inject needed capital
into the business community, sustain or improve business profitability and
protect the jobs of this City. (Ord.  1999-10.  Passed 3-1-99.)
   159.03  CRITERIA FOR INVESTMENTS.
   The Director of Finance may invest in linked deposits provided that at the
time of placement of the linked deposit not more than sixty percent (60%) of
the City's total investment portfolio is so invested. (Ord.  1999-10.  Passed

determine the credit worthiness of each small business.
   (b)    An eligible business shall certify on its loan application that the
reduced rate loan will be used exclusively to create new jobs or preserve
existing jobs and employment opportunities. Whoever knowingly makes a false
statement concerning such application is guilty of the offense of falsification
under Ohio R.C. 2921.13.
   (c)   In considering which eligible businesses should receive reduced rate
loans, the eligible lending institution shall give priority to the economic
needs of the area in which the business is located and the number of jobs to be
created or preserved by the receipt of such loan.
   (d)   The eligible financial institution shall forward to the Wooster Growth
Corporation a linked deposit loan package in the form and manner as prescribed
by the Corporation. This package shall include such information as required by

   (b)   Upon acceptance of the linked deposit loan package or any portion
thereof, the Director of Finance may place certificates of deposit with the
eligible lending institution at a rate up to three percent (3%) below current
market rates as determined and calculated by the Director of Finance.  When
necessary, the Director of Finance may place certificates of deposit prior to
acceptance of a linked deposit loan package.
   (c)   The eligible lending institution shall enter into a deposit agreement
with the Director of Finance, which shall include requirements necessary to
carry out the purposes of Sections
159.02 to
159.07.  Such requirements shall reflect the market conditions prevailing in
the eligible lending institution’s lending area.  The agreement may include a
specification of the period of time in which the lending institution is to lend
funds upon the placement of a linked deposit, and shall include provisions for
the certificates of deposit to be placed for up to two-year maturities that may
be renewed for up to an additional two years.  Interest shall be paid at the
times determined by the Director of Finance.  After the initial two-year
renewal, the linked deposit may be renewed for an additional term of two (2)
years at a discount rate of one percent lower than the initial term.
   (d)   Eligible lending institutions shall comply fully with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 135 with exceptions made only by the Director of Finance.  (Ord. 2008-

certification of compliance with this section in the form and manner as
prescribed by the Director of Finance shall be required of the eligible lending
institution.
(Ord. 2008-24.  Passed 8-18-08.)
   (b)   The Director shall take any and all steps necessary to implement the
Linked Deposit Program and monitor compliance of eligible lending institutions
and eligible small businesses.
Annually, by February 1, the Director shall report on the Linked Deposit
Program for the preceding calendar year to the Mayor and Council. The report

   (a)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Ohio R.C. 153.50 to 153.52, Council
hereby authorizes the Director of Administration or the Administrator of
Wooster Community Hospital to determine which contracts for construction,
alteration, expansion, repair, restoration, rehabilitation or remodeling of a
public work or improvement shall be bid or awarded on a single contract basis,
thereby making the successful bidder a prime or general contractor who shall be
responsible for completing and supervising the entire public work or
improvement, and which contracts for construction, alteration, repair,
restoration, rehabilitation, expansion or remodeling of a public work and
improvement shall be bid or awarded using separate and distinct contracts for
each trade or kind of mechanical labor, employment or business involved in the
work or improvement.
   In making the determination as to whether a public work or improvement
contract should be bid or awarded as a lump sum contract or through the use of
separate and distinct trade contracts, the Director of Administration or the

      (1)   The recommendation, if any, of the manager of the department or

financially advantageous manner of bidding the public work or improvement;

bidding process is used.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Ohio R.C. 153.12(A), which requires
the public owner to disclose its own estimate of the cost of the work being
competitively bid in the project plans and specifications, Council hereby
authorizes the Director of Administration or the Administrator of Wooster
Community Hospital to determine which bids for construction, alteration,
expansion, repair, restoration, rehabilitation or remodeling of a public work
or improvement shall include the City’s own estimate of the cost of the work to
be performed and which contracts shall not include such an estimate.  In making
this decision, the Director of Administration or the Administrator of Wooster
Community Hospital shall consider the recommendations of the manager of the
department or division involved in the public work or improvement, or the
recommendation of the Director of Finance on the advisability of including the
City’s own cost estimates with the plans and specifications for the work to be

   160.04  CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS; ESTIMATES, PAYMENTS.
   (a)    Funds certified by the Director of Finance for payment of all
contracts including "public works" shall be deposited in the General Treasury,
or in a Special Improvement Fund, and interest earned from moneys on deposit in
these funds shall be credited to the respective fund, and shall not be paid to
the contractor in addition to the regular price of the contract.
   (b)    Bids for work under the supervision of the Director of Administration
or Hospital Administrator shall be opened at 12:00 noon, on the last day for
filing. The bids shall be publicly read upon opening. Each bid shall contain
the full name of each person or company submitting the bid and shall be
accompanied by a bond or certified check on a solvent bank securing the
veracity of the bid and the intention of the bidder to enter into a contract
with the City. A contract under this chapter shall be entered into or rejected
by the authorized City official within sixty days from the date bids are opened
and publicly read. If the work bid embraces both labor and material, such items
shall be separately stated in the bid with the price thereof. The Director or
Hospital Administrator may reject any bid. Where there is reason to believe
there is collusion or combination among bidders, the bids of those concerned
therein shall be rejected.
   (c)   The contract referred to in this chapter shall be between the City and
the bidder, and the City shall pay the contract price in cash. Where the
contract requires completion of a contract prior to a specified date, the City
may exact liquidated damages for every day of delay beyond the specified date.
   When, in the opinion of the Director or Hospital Administrator, it becomes
necessary in the prosecution of any work or improvement under contract to make
alterations or modifications in the contract, such alterations or modifications
shall only be made upon the order of the Director or Hospital Administrator,
but such order shall be of no effect until the price to be paid for the amended
work and for material, has been agreed upon in writing and signed by the
Director or Hospital Administrator, and the contractor.
   No contractor may be compensated for work or material because of any such
alteration or modification unless the contract is made as provided herein, nor
shall recovery be allowed for such work and for material, for more than the
agreed price.
   (d)   The unit or lump sum price stated in the contract referred to in this
chapter, including modifications, shall be used in determining the amount to be
paid, which shall constitute full and final compensation for the work
performed.
   Partial payment to the contractor for work performed under the lump sum
price shall be based on a well-balanced schedule prepared by the contractor and
approved by the City Architect or Engineer. The partial payment schedule shall
be related to principal features entering into or forming a part of the work
under the lump sum price.
   Partial payment to the contractor for labor performed under either a unit or
lump sum price contract shall be made at the rate of ninety-two percent of the
estimates prepared by the contractor and approved by the City Architect or
Engineer. All labor performed after the job is fifty percent completed, shall
be paid for at the rate of 100 percent of estimates submitted by the contractor
and approved by the City Architect or Engineer.
   (e)   At the time named in the contract for payment to the contractor, the
authorized City official, shall make in such manner and form as the City
Finance Director prescribes, a full, accurate and detailed statement of the
various kinds of labor performed and material furnished under the contract,
including the amount due for each kind of labor and material and the total
amount due on the contract. The statement shall be based upon the actual labor
and materials used, and shall give the amounts of the preceding statement and
the amount for labor performed and materials furnished since the last estimate.
From the date of acceptance of the contracted work by the City, or proper
agency thereof, four percent shall be retained as additional security for
thirty days for the faithful performance of the contract, after which time if
the contract has been faithfully performed and a performance bond posted
nothing shall be retained.
   (f)   The statements referred to in this chapter shall be filed by the
Director or Hospital Administrator and a copy thereof delivered to the City
Finance Director. When the contracted material has been furnished and delivered
to the City, but has not actually become a part of such building, construction,
alteration, addition, installation or improvement, but which has been inspected
and approved by the authorized City official, and the inspection certificate
has been attached to such statement, there shall be paid a sum equal to ninety-
two percent of the estimated value as shown by the statement. Upon such payment
the material shall become the property of the City.
   All materials furnished and delivered after the job is fifty percent
completed shall be paid for at the rate of ninety-two percent of the invoiced
value of the materials. The balance of such contract shall be paid when the
material is incorporated into and becomes a part of the building, construction,
addition, improvement, alteration or installation, unless the contractor using
the material does not prosecute the work with diligence and with the expediency
specified or intended in the contract.
   When the rate of work and amounts involved are so large that it is deemed
advisable by the City, statements and payments shall be made twice each month.
   (g)   The amounts and time of payments of any contract made by the City or
agency thereof, shall be governed by sections of this chapter.
   (h)   All contracts shall be executed by the Director of Administration or
Hospital Administrator in the name of the City, one copy of which shall be
filed in his office and one with the City Finance Director or Deputy Finance
Director for Hospital Affairs. No liability shall be created against the City
as to any matters under the supervision of such Director or Hospital
Administrator, except by his express authority. Neither the Director or
Hospital Administrator, nor any other officer or employee of the City, shall be
interested in any contract entered into in the name of the City.

      (Ord. 2015-11.  Passed 4-21-15.)
   160.062 PROCEDURES.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Ohio R.C. 9.33, 9.331, 9.332 and 153.65
through 153.71, inclusive, and any other provisions of the Ohio Revised Code
which may conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of this
section, the following provisions shall govern the selection and retention of
professional design firms and construction managers by the City of Wooster and
Wooster Community Hospital:
   (a)   All contracts for professional design firms and construction managers
in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or more shall be awarded on
the basis of the qualifications of the potential firm, including price, as
determined by the Director of Administration or the Administrator of Wooster
Community Hospital.  As needed, the City and the hospital will issue a public
notice soliciting statements of qualifications from firms interested in being
considered for design, design-build or construction management (including
construction manager at-risk) projects.  To be considered for a project,
prospective firms must submit a statement of qualifications to the Director of
Administration or the Administrator of the hospital in response to the notice. 
When it becomes necessary to hire a firm, the statements of qualifications will
be reviewed and ranked by the Director of Administration or the Administrator
of the hospital based upon the qualifications and experience of the contractor
and other relevant factors (including, but not limited to, the number of such
contracts already awarded to a firm or specific areas of expertise), as
determined by the Director or the Administrator.  Once ranked, the Director or
the Administrator will select from the list no fewer than three firms standing
highest on the list, and commence negotiations with the highest-ranking firm. 
In the event that fewer than three firms are ranked, the selection may be from
those on the list, or another request for qualifications may be issued.  If the
Director or Administrator is unable to reach agreement with the highest-ranking
firm, s/he shall notify the firm in writing of his/her intent to cease
negotiations, and s/he may enter into negotiations with the next firm on the
list.  If negotiations with the next firm fail, s/he may follow the same
procedure with the next firm on the list or s/he may request further
proposals.  In all cases, the Director or the Administrator reserves the right
to reject any or all proposals.  These procedures are not intended to be formal
bidding requirements, but rather an informal procedure to determine the most
qualified firm to which a contract should be awarded.
   (b)   The Director of Administration or the Administrator of Wooster
Community Hospital is hereby authorized to promulgate rules and regulations for
the purpose of carrying the provision of this section into effect.  Such rules
shall include a process for soliciting and receiving statements of
qualifications and a process for selecting and awarding contracts.  Such rules
and regulations shall be published and made available upon request.
   (c)   In addition to complying with the above and other existing City
ordinances and Charter provisions governing contracts and purchases generally,
the Council is authorized to establish such further procedures as are deemed to
be in the best interests of the City and the hospital for the selection of such
design professionals and construction managers.
      (Ord. 2015-11.  Passed 4-21-15.)
   160.063 PROCUREMENT OF DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.
   (a)   Whenever it is deemed to be necessary to complete a public improvement
project utilizing a design-build firm, upon authorization from Council, the
Engineering Division of the City shall develop, or contract for the development
of, a scope-of-work statement for that public improvement that defines the
public improvement and in the judgment of the Engineering Division provides
interested persons with sufficient information regarding the City’s
requirements for the public improvement to enable those persons to submit
proposals for consideration that are consistent with the needs of the City. 
The scope-of-work statement may include preliminary criteria, design criteria,
budget parameters, and schedule and delivery requirements for the public
improvement.
   (b)   When the City is using the design-build methodology, the advertisement
shall request a statement of qualifications for the design-builder, and may
also require a statement of qualifications from any major subcontractors and
sub-consultants to be used on the project, a response to a scope-of-work
statement.  In a separate sealed envelope, a technical proposal shall also be
submitted.  As used herein, the “technical proposal” shall describe the
technical nature of the design-build proposal, including design concepts and
address the requirements set forth in the scope-of-work statement for that
improvement, and may include the following items as deemed appropriate by the
City:
      (1)   Line-item or unit cost proposal;
      (2)   Lump sum cost proposal and/or guaranteed maximum price;
      (3)   Schedule and date of substantial completion of the project upon
which the contract price is based;
      (4)   Detailed response to the scope of work; and
      (5)   Such other information deemed appropriate by the City.
   (c)   The City shall evaluate any responses submitted to it pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof on the basis of the professional design and construction
qualifications and the technical approach to the scope-of-work statement of the
design-build firms who submit a response.  The City also shall evaluate
proposals submitted in accordance with subsection (i) hereof.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (d)(2) hereof, after completing
this evaluation the City shall select not less than three design-build firms
that it considers to be the most qualified to provide the required professional
design and construction services.
      (2)   If the City determines that less than three design-build firms are
qualified, the City may select less than three design-build firms on the
condition that the City issues a written statement that includes the rationale
for its determination.
   (e)   The City shall next request from the most qualified design-build firms
selected pursuant to subsection (d) hereof, a technical submission for the
public improvement that includes design concepts and addresses the requirements
set forth in the scope-of-work statement for that improvement.
   (f)   The City’s request for a technical submission shall provide all of the
following information:
      (1)   A description of the project and project delivery;
      (2)   A preliminary project schedule;
      (3)   A description of desired services, including pre-construction,
design, construction and construction management services;
      (4)   The estimated lump sum price of the public improvement;
      (5)   A request for a pricing proposal that shall be divided into a
design services fee and a preconstruction and design-build services fee.  The
pricing proposal of each design-build firm shall include at least all of the
following:
         (i)   A list of key personnel and consultants for the project;
         (ii)   The design-build firm’s statement of general conditions and
estimated contingency requirements;
         (iii)   A preliminary project schedule.
      (6)   The criteria that the City will use in evaluating a technical
submission;
      (7)   The deadline for submitting a technical submission.
   (g)   To the extent information contained in the technical submission of a
design-build firm with whom the City does not enter into a design-build
construction contract can reasonably be considered a trade secret, such
information shall remain the property of the design-build firm.  The design-
build firm shall prominently mark each document that it considers a trade
secret as a trade secret.
   Each design-build firm making a submission to the City shall grant the City
an irrevocable, fully paid up license to use as it determines proper the
information, concepts, ideas, techniques, processes, and similar information in
its submission to the City.  Except to the extent that the City enters into a
contract with a design-build firm, the design-build firm will have no
responsibility or liability to the City, its employees, contractors and/or
agents related to the use of such information, concepts, ideas, techniques,
processes and/or similar information.
   (h)   When evaluating the qualifications of a design-build firm the City
shall consider all of the following factors relative to the design-build firm:
      (1)   Competence of the design-build firm to perform the required
professional design and construction services as indicated by the technical
training, education and experience of the firm’s personnel, especially the
technical training, education, and experience of the firm’s employees who would
be assigned to perform the services;
      (2)   Ability of the design-build firm in terms of the firm’s workload
and the availability of qualified personnel, equipment and facilities to
perform the required professional design and construction services competently
and expeditiously;
      (3)   Past performance of the design-build firm as reflected by the
evaluations of the City and previous clients with respect to such factors as
control of costs, quality of work, and meeting of deadlines;
      (4)   Financial responsibility as evidenced by the capability to provide
a letter of credit, a surety bond, certified check, or cashier’s check in an
amount equal to the value of the design-build construction contract, or by
other means acceptable to the City;
      (5)   Other similar factors.
   (i)   For selecting a design-build firm after submission of the technical
submission, the City shall rank design-build firms based upon their
qualifications and the City’s evaluation of the value of each firm’s proposal. 
The City may enter into negotiations for a design-build construction contract
with the design-build firm it ranks most qualified to perform the required
professional design and construction services at a compensation the City and
design-build firm determined to be fair and reasonable, and also provides
superior value.  The City, in ranking design-build firms and their technical
submissions may consider the factors in subsection (h) hereof as well as
pricing, timing and other matters deemed appropriate depending on the needs of
the project.
   (j)   The City and design-build firm the City ranks as most qualified shall
enter into negotiations for a design-build construction contract to ensure both
of the following:
      (1)   The design-build firm and the City mutually understand the
essential requirements involved in providing the required professional design
and construction services, contract terms and any terms related to possible
distribution of savings in final project costs;
      (2)   The design-build firm will make available the necessary personnel,
equipment, and facilities to perform the professional design and construction
services within the time required by the design-build construction contract.
      (3)   Agreeing upon a procedure and schedule for determining a guaranteed
maximum price using an open book pricing method that shall represent the total
maximum amount to be paid by the City to the design-build firm for the project
and that shall include the costs of all work, the cost of its general
conditions, the contingency, and the fee payable to the design-build firm.
   (k)   If the City fails to negotiate a construction contract with the
design-build firm it ranks most qualified, the City shall inform the firm in
writing of the termination of negotiations.  The City shall then enter
negotiations with the design-build contractor it ranked next most qualified. 
If these negotiations fail, the City shall inform the design-build firm in
writing of the termination of negotiations, and the City shall enter
negotiations with each next most qualified design-build firm it selected and
ranked pursuant to subsection (h) hereof, in order of the firm’s ranking, until
a design-build construction contract is negotiated or until the City exhausts
the number of design-build firms it initially selected.
   (l)   If the City fails to negotiate a design-build construction contract
with any of the design-build firms selected and ranked pursuant to subsection
(h) hereof, it may do either of the following:
      (1)   Select additional design-build firms, rank those firms on the basis
of their qualifications, and enter into negotiations with the firm it ranks
most qualified, in the manner specified in subsections (h) and (i) hereof;
      (2)   Use any other procedure permitted by law to contract for the
construction of the public improvements.
   (m)   A design-build firm that is awarded a design-build construction
contract for the construction of a public improvement shall provide a letter of
credit, a surety bond, certified check or cashier’s check, or by other means
acceptable to the City for not less than an amount equal to the amount of the
contract minus the amount of the contract related to providing design
services.  The design-build firm shall have and maintain, or be covered by, a
professional liability insurance policy acceptable to the City.  The bond and
the liability insurance policy shall be provided by a company that is
authorized to do business in this State.

(Ord. 2006-6.  Passed 3-20-06.)
   161.03  POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR MANAGING GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS.
   In the preparation and adoption of the annual appropriation ordinance, the
Mayor and City Council will implement the following procedures which pertain to
governmental funds:
   (a)   The City government will continue to pay its obligations in a timely
manner, including payments of principal and interest on loans.
   (b)   Beginning with budget year 2001, the City Council will not adopt an
annual appropriation ordinance which is not based upon the rate of return on
governmental assets.
      (1)   The rate of return on governmental assets is defined as the
difference between estimated revenues and estimated expenses, divided by total
governmental assets.
      (2)   Such rate of return shall be equal to the estimated change in the
consumer price index for each budget year.
      (3)   If authorized by a vote of three-fourths of its membership, City
Council may adopt an annual appropriation ordinance which varies from the
foregoing requirement.
   (c)   Once adopted, City Council will not adopt an amendment to the annual
appropriation ordinance providing for the expenditure of previously
unappropriated monies unless it funds that amendment with a source of funds
within the five year plan required by Charter.
   (d)   Effective December 31, 1999, and on December 31 of each year
thereafter, the City government shall have an unencumbered cash balance in the
General Fund of at least 60 days of expenditures.  If such balance exceeds 240
days of expenditures, the City will reduce either the income tax or property
tax in order to reduce such balance and bring it within the 240 day limit.
   (e)   Effective December 31, 2001, and on December 31 of each year
thereafter, the City government shall have a cash balance in the Capital
Improvement Fund which is, at a minimum, equal to the value of the annual
depreciation of the governmental fund assets; provided that if authorized by a
vote of three-fourths of its membership, City Council may adopt an annual
appropriation ordinance which varies from the foregoing requirement.
   (f)   If the actual rate of return on assets in the governmental funds for
the previous year is greater than the adjusted rate of inflation as reported by
the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, and if the cash requirements of
subsections (d) and (e) hereof are met, the City government will lower either
the income tax rate or the property tax by the equivalent of one mill or more. 
The adjustment to the rate shall be made for the following tax year.  (Ord.
2010-02.  Passed 2-1-10.)
   161.04  POLICY FOR MANAGING ENTERPRISE FUNDS.
   City Council has declared that enterprise funds should be self-supporting
operations.  Therefore, in the preparation and adoption of the annual
appropriation ordinance, the Mayor and City Council will implement the
following policy which pertains to enterprise funds:
   (a)   In establishing the charges for services in the enterprise funds:
      (1)   Sufficient revenue must be generated by the charges to ensure high
quality service for an indefinite period of time.  Therefore, the return on
assets must approximate inflation after consideration of gifts, donations,
grants and subsidized loans; and
      (2)   Sufficient cash flow must be generated by the charges to ensure all
expenditures, including debt service, can be paid in a timely manner.
         (Ord.  2002-29.  Passed 4-15-02.)
   161.05  EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC FUNDS.
   It shall be the policy of the City that public funds may be expended for
food, beverages (non-alcoholic) or other amenities (including, but not limited
to, flowers, token retirement and services awards).  The decisions to expend
such funds will lie with the official whose budget is affected by the decision.
(Ord. 2004-6.  Passed 4-5-04.)
   161.06  AUDIT COMMITTEE.
   (a)   (1)   Membership.  There is hereby established an Audit Committee.  It
shall consist of three voting members, each of whom shall be residents of the
City. They shall be appointed by the Mayor with the consent of Council, and
they shall serve without compensation for terms of three years (except that the
original appointments shall be for terms of one, two and three years).  Members
should be selected based upon their experience in business, finance and/or
accounting.  Vacancies should be filled within thirty (30) days after a vacancy
occurs, and the appointee will complete the unexpired term.  In the case of
vacancy by reason of expiration of term, a member shall continue to serve until
the appointment of a successor, or until the expiration of sixty (60) days,
whichever event first occurs.
      (2)   In addition to the foregoing, the Mayor or his/her designee, the
Law Director, the Director of Finance, the president of City Council, and the
chairperson of the Finance Committee of City Council will serve as non- voting
members ex officio of the Audit Committee.
   (b)   Duties. The Audit Committee shall have the primary duty of advising or
making recommendations to the Mayor in matters pertaining to the City’s
financial reporting process.  In so doing, the Audit Committee shall:
      (1)   Act as liaison between the municipal government and the Auditor of
State or outside auditor;
      (2)   Meet with the auditor prior to the annual audit to review the scope
and terms of the audit; and following the audit to review the results thereof;

   162.03  LEAVES.
     Management level employees shall be paid their full salary while on sick
and vacation leaves.  They shall continue to earn sick leave and vacation
credit while on sick leave, injury leave, vacation leave and military leave.
     (a)     Sick Leave.  Management employees shall earn 1.25 sick leave days
for each month of service.  Such sick leave credit shall be recorded in the
first pay period of each month.  The amount of sick leave which may be
accumulated is unlimited.  Employees may only use sick leave which has been
previously accumulated.
            (1)     The previously accumulated sick leave of employees who have
been separated from the public service other than through retirement may be
placed to their credit upon their re-employment in public service, if re-
employed within ten years.  Employees who transfer from one public agency to
another shall be credited with the unused balance of their accumulated sick
leave upon furnishing a satisfactorily written statement signed by an
appropriate official of such other public agencies stating the employees'
accumulated balance from such other public agencies.
            (2)     A.     Upon retirement from City service, management
employees with at least ten years of service with the City retire, they shall
be paid thirty-three percent (33%) of their accumulated sick leave, not to
exceed seventy-five (75) days.  When management employees with less than ten
years of service with the City, but with ten or more years' service with the
State, any political subdivision, or a combination thereof retire from active
service with the City, the rate shall be reduced to twenty-five percent (25%),
not to exceed seventy-five (75) days.  Such payment shall be based on the
employee's rate of pay at the time of retirement and eliminates all sick leave
credit accrued but unused by the employee at the time of the payment.  As used
in this section, "retirement" is limited to the point at which an employee is
then eligible to receive disability or service retirement payments under any
State or municipal retirement system in this State.
                 B.     In the case of the death of an employee, the estate of
an employee with ten or more years of service to the City shall receive payment
for his/her accumulated sick leave based upon the employee's rate of pay at
time of death.  Maximum payment shall be as prescribed in the preceding
subsection, provided that an employee who died before becoming eligible for
retirement will be limited to a maximum payment calculated by multiplying the
figure from subsection (a)(2) A. hereof by the fraction of the employee's total
years of service divided by 30. 
            (3)     Management employees may use sick leave for absences due to
personal illness, and/or examination by an appropriate health care
practitioner.  Sick leave may also be used for illness of or injury to a member
of the employee's family (spouse, children or employee's parents).  For use of
sick leave for parents of an employee, employees are limited to no more than
three days per calendar year.
            (4)     Sick leave incentive. Management level employees who have a
minimum of forty days of accumulated sick leave on the first day of the last
pay period ending in the preceding year, and who increase that balance by an
additional eleven days from the first day of the last pay period ending in
December of the current year, shall qualify for sick leave incentive.
                 A.     Management employees who meet the criteria shall
receive an additional two and one-half day's pay on their last paycheck in
December.
                 B.       When sick leave incentive payment is made, the Mayor
or his/her designee is authorized to deduct two and one-half days of sick leave
credit from the employee's balance on the last day of the first pay period
ending in December.
               C.     Sick leave used when attending funerals shall not be
counted as used when calculating sick leave incentive.
     (b)     Injury Leave.  If management employees are injured while
performing their assigned duties or contract illness under such conditions and,
as a result of such injury or illness are certified unable to work by a
licensed physician, employees shall be compensated according to the following
plan:  The first one hundred twenty (120) scheduled working hours of disability
shall be drawn from accumulated sick leave.  The next four hundred eighty (480)
consecutive working hours of certified disability caused by the original injury
or illness shall be compensated as follows:  the employees will be compensated
through Wage Continuation, whereby the employer will pay the employee's regular
earnings in lieu of Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation reimbursement.  In the
event the employee continues to be certified as disabled and unable to return
to work after having exhausted the initial four hundred eighty (480) hours of
earnings paid through Wage Continuation, the employer shall pay to the employee
the difference between the payment received from the Ohio Bureau of Worker's
Compensation and his/her regular earnings for an additional four hundred forty
(440) scheduled working hours.
     (c)     Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).  The City of Wooster is and will
remain in compliance with respect to the FMLA regulations and requirements.
     (d)     Bereavement Leave.  In the event of the death of an immediate
family member, employees will be permitted to take up to five (5) days with
full pay for purposes of dealing with matters related to death and grieving. 
Such leave will not be granted to employees attending a funeral during periods
when, for other reasons, they are not at work, such as during vacation,
holidays or illness.
     (e)       Personal Leave.  A management level employee may request an
unpaid or personal leave of absence for a period not to exceed thirty-one (31)
calendar days. Request for renewal may be made only once. Award or denial of a
personal leave shall be made by the Mayor and/or Director of Administration.
All decisions shall be final. During any such period of personal leave
employees will continue to be covered by the City's existing health care plan.
     (f)     Non-FMLA Medical Leave.  Management employees who have exhausted
both their FMLA eligibility and their accrued sick leave balance and require
additional time off because of illness, may request a medical leave of absence.
            (1)     A medical leave is taken without pay.
            (2)       The employee does not earn vacation or sick leave credit
while on an unpaid medical leave. The Mayor and/or Director of Administration
shall continue health insurance coverage for such employee.
            (3)     The maximum length of time an employee may request for a
non-FMLA medical leave is ninety (90) calendar days. A renewal may be awarded
only once.
       (g)     Vacation Leave.
      (1)   Effective June 1, 2018 and forward, the Mayor or designee shall
permit prior service with any other governmental agencies for any new
management employee who is hired from such agency for purposes of computing the
amount of the employee's vacation leave.  A written statement signed by an
appropriate official of such other governmental agency stating the employee's
service time shall be provided.

shall be forfeited unless the Mayor, in his/her sole discretion, has granted a

using such excess vacation leave, may exceed the maximum accrual for the period
of the waiver, which shall not exceed six months.
            (5)     Time spent in military service is to be counted as service
with the City when determining vacation leave, provided the employee in
question was a City employee for at least 120 calendar days before entering

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the

of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving

The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term.  Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth
in Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, a mandatory jail term of
sixty consecutive days.  The court shall impose the sixty-day mandatory jail
term under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this
section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of electronically monitored house arrest with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation

have more than one valid license at any time.    (ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section 525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
 
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
 501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

the wild or exotic animal, such animal shall not be replaced.

   511.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    "Alarm system" means any assembly of equipment and devices which

as defined in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)    "Interconnected alarm system" means an alarm system which directly or
indirectly automatically or manually, uses a telephone line, cable line or
radio wave to transmit an alarm or message upon activation of the alarm system.
   (c)    "Local alarm system" means an alarm system that when activated only
sounds a horn, bell, buzzer, or other type of audible or visible alarm that is
designed to be audible or visible beyond the premises being served, but which
does not result in the transmission of a signal to any other location.
   (d)    "Appropriate authority" means the Mayor of the City of Wooster, Ohio,
or his/her  designee.
   (e)    "Automatic dialing device" means a device which is interconnected to
a telephone line and is programmed to select a predetermined telephone number
and transmit by voice, message or code signal an emergency message indicating a
need for emergency response.
   (f)    "Alarm" means an alarm signal transmitted to the central dispatch
facility or a phone call forwarded by an alarm company monitoring center,
requiring the response of the Wooster Police or Fire Divisions.
   "Alarm" shall also include any system which meets the definition in
subsection (c) of "local alarm system".
   (g)    "False alarms" are those calls for police or fire service as detailed
in subsection (f) hereof, which are erroneously transmitted or sounded due to
mechanical or human error.  “False alarms” shall be in two categories: non-
chargeable and chargeable.
      (1)    "Non-chargeable false alarms" shall include those alarms which are
transmitted or sounded due to weather conditions, power or telephone outages.
Calls made to the central dispatch facility canceling the appropriate police or
fire service prior to their arrival may, at the discretion of the appropriate
chief, constitute a "non-chargeable false alarm".
      (2)    "Chargeable false alarms" shall include those alarms which are
transmitted or sounded due to human error or equipment malfunctions not
included in subsection (g)(1) hereof.
         (Ord. 1999-1. Passed 2-1-99.)
   511.02  ALARM CATEGORY DETERMINATION.
   The responding Police or Fire personnel shall determine, upon provisions set
forth herein, in which category the alarm shall be recorded.
(Ord. 1999-1. Passed 2-1-99.)
   511.03  CHARGEABLE ALARM NOTIFICATION.
   (a)    The first three chargeable alarm notifications within any calendar

   (b)    Additional chargeable alarm notification subject to false alarm
response payments as detailed in Section
511.99(c) shall be made by ordinary and certified mail sent to the owner or

   (b)    Inspections. The appropriate authority or his designee shall have the
authority, at reasonable times and upon oral notice, to enter upon any premises
within the City, to inspect only the installation and operation of an
interconnected alarm system, the purpose of which is to report an emergency to
the Police or Fire Division. In the event the premises to be inspected is a
private dwelling, such inspection shall only be done between the hours of 8:00

owner and presented to a responsible adult. Under this chapter, such residences
are only subject to the above inspection after four false alarms have
originated from such location. The written notice shall cite the specific false
alarm history. Failure to allow reasonable inspection of such alarm system may
be grounds for disconnection from an interconnected alarm system.
   (c)    Required Repairs. The appropriate authority or his designee may
require that repairs or adjustments be made whenever he has determined that
such repairs or adjustments are necessary to the proper functioning of the
alarm system. He may also order temporary disconnection of the alarm system
until completion of such repairs or adjustments.
   (d)    Police Alarm Systems.  All police alarm systems shall be installed
and maintained with an automatic cut-off , and re-set of the alarm within
fifteen minutes of the activation of the alarm system.

property where an alarm system is installed must notify the Police Division of
the name, address and telephone number of the person who may be contacted in
the event an alarm is received from that property.  Upon request of the
appropriate fire or police personnel, such contact person will come to the
scene of the alarm to assist safety personnel in examining or securing the
scene. Failure of the contact person without just cause to come to the scene
upon such request will result in the finding of a chargeable false alarm and
the corresponding assessment of the cost thereof without regard to the
limitations of Section
511.03.

each person affected thereby may further appeal to the Mayor or his/her
designee from the decision of the Chief of the respective division provided
that such appeal is made in writing within five days of the receipt of written
notification of the initial determination. The decision of the Mayor or

   (a)    "Sidewalk" means that portion of a street between the curb line, or
the lateral lines of a roadway, and the adjacent property lines, intended for
the use of pedestrians.  (ORC 4511.01 (FF)).
   (b)    "Roadway" means that portion of a street or highway improved,
designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, except the berm or shoulder.
If a street or highway includes two or more separate roadways, the term
"roadway" means any such roadway separately but not all such roadways
collectively.
      (ORC 4511.01(EE)).
   (c)    "Scaling" means the gradual and continuing loss of surface mortar and
aggregate from a concrete sidewalk.
   (d)    "Spalling" means the separation and removal of a portion of the
surface concrete revealing a fracture roughly parallel, or slightly inclined to
the surface.
   (e)    "Slab" or "block" means that portion of a sidewalk between
construction joints, commonly measuring four feet square or five feet square.
   (f)   "Unevenness" means irregular or varying, not uniform, not flat or
level, not smooth or constant and not in the same plane.
   (g)    "Driveway" means a paved or unpaved area, built on a public right of
way, serving as a means of vehicular egress or ingress between a public street
and privately owned property.
      (Ord. 1986-21. Passed 6-2-86.)
   903.02  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall construct, alter, remove, demolish or commence the
construction, alteration, removal or demolition of a sidewalk, driveway, curb
or gutter within a public right of way without first filing an application in
writing and obtaining a formal permit for such work. It shall be unlawful to
perform such work, or to permit or employ others to perform such work, except
in conformity with such permit. However, no permit shall be required for such
work performed as a condition precedent to the approval of a subdivision plat
by the Planning Commission, if such work conforms to construction plans and
specifications which meet the approval of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1972-35.  Passed 4-3-72.)
   903.03  ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   Application for a driveway or sidewalk permit shall be on a prescribed form
and shall be accompanied by three copies of plans, sketches and descriptions
sufficient to completely describe the proposed work. If it appears that the
proposed work will be in conformity to Sections
903.06 and
903.07 and all other applicable ordinances and acceptable engineering and
construction procedure, and upon receipt of a permit fee and performance bond
as hereinafter set forth, a permit for the proposed work shall be issued.
(Ord. 1972-35.  Passed 4-3-72.)
   903.04  PERMIT FEE.
   The fee for driveway and sidewalk permits shall be in accordance with the
Schedule of Fees and Charges. 
(Ord. 2004-7.  Passed 4-5-04.)
   903.05  BOND.
   At the time of application, the applicant shall furnish a performance bond
for the amount of the estimated construction cost of the driveway or sidewalk.
The performance bond or cash deposit submitted to the City will assure the City
that the subdivider or property owner or his heirs, successors and assigns,
their agents or servants will comply with all applicable terms, conditions,
provisions and requirements of this chapter, and will faithfully perform and
complete the work of constructing the driveway or sidewalk. The bond shall be
in a form approved by the Director of Law. The term of this bond shall extend
twelve months beyond the completion date of the project, but the bond shall be
returned to the bonded person upon the verification, by the City Engineer, that
the driveway or sidewalk is completed and accepted.  (Ord. 1972-35.  Passed 4-
3-72.)
   903.06  SIDEWALK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Width.  Except as otherwise provided in the Subdivision Regulations,
the width of sidewalks for various streets shall be as follows:
      (1)    For streets forty feet or less in width the sidewalks shall be
four feet in width.
      (2)    For streets of more than forty feet in width, the sidewalks shall
be five feet in width, except that Council may by ordinance change or alter the
above to apply to special conditions which may arise and when, in the opinion
of Council, such changes or alterations are necessary by virtue of good and
sufficient reasons.
   (b)    Elevation. The elevation of sidewalks for various streets shall be as
follows:
      (1)    Where sidewalk elevations have been previously determined by
action of Council, sidewalks shall be so constructed as to correspond with the
established elevation at the sidewalk line as hereinafter established, and to
have a cross slope of one-fourth inch to one foot toward the curb or roadway.
      (2)    Where sidewalk elevations have not been specifically established
by Council, the elevation of the sidewalk shall be such as will make a uniform
cross slope of one-fourth inch to one foot from the elevation of the sidewalk
at the sidewalk line as hereinafter established. Where curb grades have not
been specifically established, the curb grade for both curbs of a street shall
be presumed to be six inches higher than the gutter grade provided that when,
in the opinion of the City Engineer, it becomes necessary to preserve the
symmetry of the street or the uniformity of the grade of the existing
sidewalks, the specified cross slope as hereinbefore established may be
increased to not more than one inch to one foot, provided also that where
sidewalks intersect, the above specified cross slope may be so altered as to
cause the grade line of the sidewalk to intersect the grade line of an existing
sidewalk, or to intersect an established sidewalk grade line.
   (c)    Line. The sidewalk line, meaning that edge of the sidewalk farthest
from the curb or roadway, shall be the property line which is the same as the
boundary line of the street. Sidewalks shall be so laid that their edges
farthest from the curb or roadway coincide with the sidewalk line as herein
established. However, Council may by ordinance change or alter the above to
apply to special conditions which may arise and when, in the opinion of
Council, such changes or alterations are necessary by virtue of good and
sufficient reasons.
   (d)   Grade Stakes. Prior to the construction of a sidewalk, the City
Engineer shall be requested to set as many grade stakes as he deems necessary
to indicate the correct elevation of the sidewalk. It shall be a violation of
this section to construct a sidewalk which does not conform to such grade
stakes. (Ord. 1972-35. Passed 4-3-72.)
   (e)   Construction Specifications. Sidewalks shall be constructed of
Portland cement concrete, conforming to Specification Class "C" of the State of
Ohio Department of Transportation. They shall not be less than four inches in
thickness and that portion which is in the driveway area shall be at least six
inches in thickness. Brick surfaced construction will be considered, when
desired to produce a decorative effect, if placed on a four inch Portland
cement concrete base and the bricks set in a mastic material or placed as a
monolithic structure. Asphaltic concrete shall not be used except by license
from Council. Construction of sidewalks shall be in conformance to sound
construction practice, and in conformance to the specifications on file in the
office of the City Engineer. (Ord. 1973-87. Passed 8-16-73.)
   (f)   Repair. The requirements of subsection (e) hereof shall govern all
work of reconstruction or repair of sidewalks. (Ord. 1972-35. Passed 4-3-72.)
   903.07  DRIVEWAY REQUIREMENTS. 
   (a)   Conformance. All new driveways and the replacement of existing
driveways shall conform to the following policy set forth in this section and
the specification on file in the City Engineer's office. The City Engineer
shall have the authority to impose reasonable requirements concerning the
placement of a driveway to alleviate hazards of vehicles entering and leaving a
public thoroughfare.  If, for some unforseen reason, the enforcement of this
policy would make a driveway a hazard or impractical for normal use, the City
Engineer may authorize and/or recommend some revision in the policy to fit that
particular situation. The maintenance of the driveway and the cost thereof
shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
   (b)   Geometries. Each driveway entrance shall conform to the following: 
      (1)    The driveway shall be constructed perpendicular or ninety degrees
to the center line of the street. 
      (2)    The driveway width measured at the front edge of the sidewalk, or
the sidewalk location if it does not exist at the time of construction, shall
be a minimum of twelve feet and not more than twenty-five feet. The curb
opening or driveway width at the street pavement edge shall have a minimum
width of twenty feet and not more than thirty-five feet.
      (3)   The driveway edges shall each have a 2:1 (length to width) flare
rate. A curved edge with a minimum radius of ten feet may also be used. 
   (c)   Number Permitted. For properties which are accessible from two street
lines, there will be one driveway permitted on each street line for the first
150 feet of frontage on each street line. For properties which are accessible
from only one street line, there will be permitted a maximum of two driveways
for the first 150 feet of frontage. The number of driveways permitted on
properties with frontages in excess of 150 feet will be subject to
recommendation and approval of the City Engineer. 
   (d)   Materials. The materials used for driveway construction shall conform
to the Construction and Material Specifications published by the State of Ohio,
Department of Transportation. The material required for driveway construction
shall be as follows: 
      (1)    Improved streets:
         A.    Item 452 plain Portland cement concrete pavement with a minimum
thickness of six inches for residential and seven inches for commercial drives,
or
         B.    Item 404 asphalt concrete (hot mix) with a minimum thickness of
two and one-half inches-placed over six inches of Item 310 subbase (granular
material).
      (2)    Unimproved Streets: Driveway shall be six inches of Item 304
aggregate base material. 
   (e)   Drainage. In areas where side ditches exist along a street, a driveway
culvert shall be installed at the expense of the property owner. The culvert
shall be a minimum of twelve inches in diameter and whatever length needed to
span the approach. It shall be constructed of corrugated metal or extra
strength concrete. Other materials may be used with approval by the Engineer.
On streets where no curb exists the driveways shall be graded so as not to pond
or collect water on the street pavement. All driveway grading and drainage
culverts shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
   (f)   Cuts. In situations where the existing curb must be lowered to the
two-inch dropped curb, breaking the curb down to the gutter line with a hammer
will not be permitted. The procedures for cutting curbs shall be as follows:
      (1)    Concrete pavement with integral curb. A neat saw joint shall be
made two feet from the back of the curb and parallel to the curb for a distance
of one foot beyond the corners of the new driveway. Another saw joint then will
be made perpendicular to the first cut through the curb. The concrete pavement
shall be removed to the subbase and replaced with new concrete pavement forming
the dropped curb.
      (2)    Concrete or Asphalt pavement with separate curb and gutter. The
curb and gutter portion shall be sawed at a point one foot beyond the corners
of the new driveway. The curb and gutter will then be removed to the subbase
and replaced with new concrete forming the dropped curb.
         (Ord. 1972-35. Passed 4-3-72.)
   903.08  EXISTING SIDEWALKS TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR.
   (a)   In addition to the requirements of other applicable ordinances (i.e.,
Section
521.06 of the General Offenses Code), every owner of real estate in the City
abutting an existing sidewalk, shall be required to maintain such sidewalk in
good repair.
   (b)   The City Engineer or his duly authorized representative shall conduct
a survey of the sidewalks of the City from time to time in those areas of the
City in which the most need for sidewalk replacement exists. He shall determine
the need for repair or replacement of sidewalks based upon the following
criteria.
      (1)    Unevenness. A sidewalk shall be considered uneven if it is not
uniform or constant, varies in elevation or is not in the same plane. That
portion of the sidewalk that is uneven shall be replaced.
      (2)    Drainage. There shall be adequate drainage from the surface of the
sidewalk. The Engineer may require the replacement or repair of a portion of
sidewalk because of inadequate drainage.
      (3)    Spalling or Scaling. If twenty-five percent (25%) of the surface
of a sidewalk, as determined by the Engineer or his representative, is spalled,
scaled, chipped or flaked off, the sidewalk shall be replaced.
      (4)    Differential settlement (stumbling blocks). The difference in
elevation between adjacent sidewalk slabs shall not exceed one inch. The
defective slabs shall be repaired or replaced.
      (5)    Cracks and joints. Cracks or joints in themselves shall not be
considered defects unless they open to a width of one inch or greater. Slabs or
blocks of sidewalks broken into five or less pieces may remain in place as long
as adjacent broken pieces have a difference in elevation of one inch or less.
Slabs or blocks of walk broken into six or more pieces shall be replaced.
   These criteria may be used singly or in combination to determine if defects
warrant repair or replacement of sidewalks.
   (c)   When a sidewalk is to be repaired or replaced, it shall be done in
accordance with this chapter.
   (d)   Paved driveway approaches are considered part of the sidewalk area and
shall be judged in accordance with the above criteria and repaired or replaced
when found defective.
   (e)   Upon completion of the survey in subsection (b) hereof, the Engineer
shall prepare cost estimates for the necessary sidewalk repairs or
replacements.  The Engineer or his duly authorized representative shall give
notice to the owners of  abutting property to repair or replace the sidewalks
as required by Section
521.06 and the Property Maintenance Code.
(Ord. 2008-05.  Passed 2-4-08.)
   903.09  COOPERATIVE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.
   The City assists the property owner, in the replacement of defective
sidewalks, with a cooperative program whereby the City engages a contractor on
the basis of competitive bids to get the lowest possible cost and if the
property owner will contribute seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost to the
City, the City will have the sidewalk replaced and pay the remaining twenty-
five percent (25%) of the cost. The City will pay one hundred percent (100%) of
the cost of sidewalks within the intersections. (Ord. 1986-21. Passed 6-2-86.)
   903.10  SIDEWALKS ON IMPROVED STREETS.
   Sidewalks shall be constructed on existing improved streets at such time as
Council determines the necessity of sidewalks or the property owners petition
Council for sidewalks. In determining the necessity for sidewalks, Council may
consider the following:
   (a)   The use of the street as a connector street, as identified by various
available maps such as:
      (1)    The Thoroughfare Map, which was adopted by the Planning Commission
on 2/25/81, which shows major streets and collector streets;
      (2)    The City Urban Area Map which identifies principal arterial, minor
arterial and collector streets, which are the approved functionally classified
and federal aid routes. (Developed in 1975).
      (3)   The Permissive Tax Street System Map, developed in June 1984, which
identifies those streets which are important for movement of traffic and which
qualify for permissive tax funds.
   (b)   The streets, proximity to schools, parks, business districts, public
and semi-public buildings and other places which attract much pedestrian
traffic.
   (c)    The street's location with relation to existing and potential
vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
   (d)    The need to connect areas with existing sidewalks so as to provide
safe walkways for pedestrian traffic between various parts of the City.
   (e)   Upon determination by City Council of the necessity for sidewalks
based on subsection (a) hereof, the Engineer shall, pursuant to Ohio R.C.
729.01 to 729.05, prepare plans, specifications and cost estimates for the
necessary sidewalk repairs or replacements.  These shall then be reported to
Council which shall proceed according to the above statutes to give notice to
the owners of abutting property to repair or replace the sidewalks as required
by resolution of Council.  If the property owners fail to repair or replace the
sidewalks as required by resolution of Council, the City shall proceed,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 729.01 to 729.05, and repair or replace the sidewalks and
assess the costs against the lots or lands abutting thereon. 
(Ord. 2008-05.  Passed 2-4-08.)
   903.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter, fails to comply with any
lawful order issued by the City Engineer under the provisions of this chapter,

   921.01  AUTHORITY FOR RESTRICTION OF USE OF WATER.
   The Mayor is hereby authorized to restrict the use of water in the City in
the manner hereinafter provided:
   (a)   The Director of Administration shall notify the Mayor in writing that
an emergency condition exists as to the water supply of the City.
   (b)   The Mayor shall issue a proclamation which shall be published at least
once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City declaring such emergency
and stating in plain language the restrictions placed upon the use of water.
   (c)   Such restrictions shall take effect the day following the publication
set out in subsection (b) hereof. 
(Ord. 2017-24.  Passed 9-5-17.)
   921.02  ENFORCEMENT.
   No person shall use water from the Municipal water supply in violation of
any restriction placed upon the use of the same by the Mayor when issued in
accordance with Section
921.01. 
(Ord. 2017-24.  Passed 9-5-17.)
   921.03  OWNERSHIP ANDCONTROL OF THE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.
   (a)   The public water supply system of the City, including all water mains,
laterals, valves, hydrants, meters, and services, is under the exclusive
control of the Director of Administration and his/her authorized agents and
employees.  Such control shall include all piping from the City mains to the
point of ultimate consumption or to where the City water is finally discharged
freely at atmospheric pressure.  Such control shall be governed by these
Codified Ordinances and such water regulations as may be adopted by the
Director of Administration.
   (b)   Whenever a break or leak occurs in a public water main, or the portion
of a water service line between the water main and the curb box, the City will
repair this at its own expense as soon as possible. 
   (c)   Whenever a break or leak occurs in a private water main, or in the
portion of a water service line between the curb box and the meter at any place
upon the premises supplied, it shall be repaired at the expense of the customer
or property owner.  If the City, in order to prevent excessive waste or
substantial damage, deems it to be an urgent and necessary action to shut off
the water, such action will be taken.  The City shall give written notice in
advance to the customer and property owner.  The customer or property owner
must then make repairs before water service will be restored. In cases where
the break or leak is creating a safety hazard or a high volume of water is
being lost, the City, after using its best efforts to notify the customer and
property owner, may elect to repair the break or leak with either its own
personnel or a contractor, with the cost of such work being paid for by the
property owner. The property owner may be charged for the water lost due to
breaks or leaks, with the estimated rate of water loss being based on a
standard engineering calculation and applied to the period of time from when
the property owner is first notified of the break or leak, to when the break or
leak is repaired or the water is shut off (whichever occurs first).
   (d)   The City reserves the right to test and replace meters without the
consent of the customer or property owner.  The City will endeavor to provide
reasonable notice prior to testing or replacing a meter.
   (e)   The customer and property owner are responsible for providing access
to meters for authorized City personnel.  Failure to comply may result in water
service disconnection.
   (f)   The customer and property owner are responsible for maintaining
plumbing at a property served by City water in a condition that allows metering
equipment to be installed, maintained, and repaired or replaced by the City. 
Failure to comply may result in water service disconnection.
   (g)   The property owner is responsible for providing access for inside
shutoffs at rental properties.  If the property owner fails to provide access
for an inside shutoff due to a delinquent account, the tenant's name will be
removed from the account, and the owner's name will be placed onto the
delinquent account. 
(Ord. 2017-24.  Passed 9-5-17.)
   921.04  TAMPERING WITH WATER SYSTEM.
   (a)   No person shall connect to any water line, tamper with or remove any
meter, registering device or seal placed by the City or insert a meter by-pass
without the written permission of the Director of Administration.  If City
personnel find that a seal has been broken or any by-pass inserted and there is
evidence that the meter or registering device has been tampered with, water
service to the unit may be terminated after written notice to the consumer and
an opportunity for a hearing. The water shall not be turned on again until the
consumer or owner of the premises pays for the estimated quantity of water
which has been used and not registered, and, in addition thereto, the standard
fee for turning off and the standard fee for turning on such water.  Payment of
the fees will not in any way relieve any person from criminal prosecution. 
Meters damaged by abuse, misuse, accident or any act of carelessness shall be
repaired or replaced at the expense of the customer.
   (b)   No person shall operate, open or otherwise tamper with any valve, 
corporation stop, curb stop, or other device after the same has been closed for
violation of any rule or regulation of the City; nor unlawfully secure a supply
of water through such valve,  corporation stop, curb stop, or other device
after same has been closed for the violation of any rule or regulation of the
City; nor in any way take water for private use unlawfully or without first
having secured written permission from the Director of Administration.
   (c)   No person shall tamper with, damage or disturb any fire hydrant, or
any part thereof, nor take any water from such hydrant under any circumstances,
without written authorization from the Director of Administration.  In case any
damage is done to a fire hydrant by any person, s/he shall, upon demand of the
Utilities Division, pay such damages and all cost and expense incurred by
reason thereof.
(Ord. 2017-24.  Passed 9-5-17.)
   921.05  LAYING WATER LINES; PAYMENT; ASSESSMENT; CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Whenever the City installs water lines without the cost of such lines
being paid for, or assessed against, all benefitting abutting property owners
benefitting from, the owner of any such abutting property to be served by such
lines, and for which property the cost has not been paid or assessed, shall pay
his or her pro rata share of such lines before connecting.  The charge to
connect to such water lines in lieu of an assessment shall be the availability
fee as set forth in the Schedule of Fees and Charges.
   (b)   At the discretion of the Director of Administration, where the land to
be charged has extraordinarily large frontage that will likely be subject to
further subdivision, a written agreement may be executed between the property
owner and the City to provide that the availability fee allocable to the excess
frontage may be paid at a later time when such excess land is separately used
or developed.  The  availability fee for such excess land shall be calculated
at the frontage foot rate in effect at the time the request to  connect is
made.
   (c)   Whenever such lines are laid by the owners or other persons with the
Director of Administration's authority, except in cases where the owners of new
subdivisions are required to make such installations at their expense by the
order of the Planning Commission under and by virtue of the  Planning & Zoning
Code of the City, such persons shall certify the cost of improvements to the
Director immediately upon completion.  These amounts shall be subject to the
approval of the Director and may be reduced if the Director, after conferring
with the Engineer, feels that the costs are excessive.
   (d)   The owner of any abutting property serviced by such lines, and for
which property, the cost has not been paid, shall pay the availability fee as
determined by the Director in accordance with this chapter before connecting. 
The money so received shall be paid to the persons who paid the cost of such
line, or to their heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, but in no event
will the aggregate of such payments exceed the cost of the improvements
certified to the Director.  However, no such payment to such person or persons
shall be made more than ten years after completion of the job and certification
of the cost to the Director.  Any money received for tapping in after ten years
shall be a part of the Water Fund of the City.
   (e)   Water Service Connections.
      (1)   No person shall connect to water lines without having first applied
for and received from the Division of Engineering a written permit authorizing
such work.  Application for a water service permit shall be made for all
domestic water service taps and all fire service taps resulting from well
abandonment, service replacement or new service connections, where no existing
water service line exists. 
      (2)   Application for a permit shall be signed by the owner, lessee, or
agent of the property for which the connection is desired, and must describe
the property and state the purpose for the connection.  Permit fees shall be
designated on the water service permit and shall consist of the following:
         A.   Administrative and review fee: A fee to cover the cost of utility
research and review of the proposed water service connection shall be charged
for each permit application.  The amount of the fee shall be as set forth in
the Schedule of Fees and Charges.
         B.   Inspection fee:  Inspection fees shall be as set forth in the
Schedule of Fees and Charges.
         C.   Availability fee: See Section
921.05(a).
      (3)   All costs and expense incidental to the installation and connection
of the water service shall be paid by the owner.  The owner shall indemnify the
City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation of the water service.
      (4)   A separate and independent water service shall be provided for
every metered user and for every fire service line.  A single tap or connection
may be made on the water main for both domestic and fire service, however, the
service lines must be separated, and provisions made for isolation with valves
prior to entering private property. Where a property owner seeks to modify
existing water service lines and the existing water services do not comply with
the provision for separate and independent water services for every metered
user as required in this section, the property owner shall establish separate
and independent water service lines as described in the City's water system
rules and regulations.
      (5)   The size, alignment, materials of construction of a water or fire
service, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, and connecting to the water main
shall all conform to the requirements of the City Engineering Construction
Standards, the Building Code of the City, and shall be approved by the City
Engineer.
      (6)   The applicant for the water service permit shall notify the City
Engineer when the water service is ready for inspection and connection to the
water main.  The connection shall be made under the supervision of the City
Engineer or his representative.
      (7)   All excavations for water line installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. 
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City.
         (Ord. 2017-24.  Passed 9-5-17.)
   921.06  UTILITY RATES, BILLING AND COLLECTION; LIABILITY FOR CHARGES.
   (a)   The Director of Administration has the authority and responsibility to
assess utility user charges of sufficient amounts and in such manner as s/he
deems equitable from all premises supplied with utility services.  In assessing
such user charges, s/he shall strictly observe the policy on rate-setting for
enterprise funds set forth in Ordinance 1989-54.  The Director of Finance has
authority and responsibility for billing and collecting utility user charges,
assessments and fees.  The customer has the right to appeal any action
resulting from this section and any actions resulting from utility
regulations.  Such request shall be made to the responsible authority.
   (b)   Requesting and accepting City utility services shall be deemed to
create a contractual relationship between the City and the customer by which
the customer agrees to pay all user charges and abide by all regulations for
the provision of utility services.  Liability for all utility service user
charges rests with the property owner of record regardless of billing name or
address.  All administrative fees, late charges and/or other collection
expenses shall be added to the utility billing of the service address. 
   (c)   Whenever a break or a leak occurs on a private water main or in the
portion of a water service line between the curb stop and the premises
supplied, the City may elect to recover costs incurred for the estimated water
lost due to the break or leak and costs incurred for the repair of the break or
leak with either its own personnel or a contractor (see
921.03c).  For any such cost, after the actual cost is determined, the City
shall give five days' notice, by regular mail, to the owner of the premises, at
his or her last known address, to pay the cost of such work, which notice shall
be accompanied by a statement of the amount of cost incurred.  In the event
that the same is not paid within thirty days after the mailing of such notice,
such amount shall be collected as described below.
   (d)   When utility user charges are not paid when due, the Director of
Finance or his representative may, in addition to charging delinquent charges
and collection fees, do either or both of the following:
      (1)   Certify delinquent amounts, together with any penalties, to the
County Auditor for placement on the tax duplicate as a lien on the property
served and, collection in the same manner as other taxes.
      (2)   Collect delinquent amounts by action at law brought in the name of
the City against the owner of the property, tenant or other person who is
liable for the unpaid charges.
   (e)   In addition to the foregoing remedies, the Director of Administration
or her/his representative may discontinue services to a property by reason of
nonpayment of billed utility user charges. 
(Ord. 2017-24.  Passed 9-5-17.)
   921.07  CROSS CONNECTION AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Utilities Manager, an approved backflow
prevention assembly is necessary for the safety of the public water system, the
Utilities Manager will give notice to the water consumer and/or property owner
to install such an approved assembly.  The water consumer and/or property owner
shall, at his or her own expense, install such an approved assembly at a
location and in a manner approved by the Utilities Manager and shall have
inspections and tests made of such approved assemblies.
   (b)   No person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection where a
private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the City of Wooster may enter the supply or distributing system
of the City, unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the
method of connection and use of such supply have been approved by the Utilities
Manager and by the Ohio EPA.
   (c)    It shall be the duty of the Utilities Manager to cause surveys and
investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist.  Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated as often as the Utilities Manager deems
necessary.
   (d)   The Utilities Manager and his or her duly authorized representative
shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the public water system or distribution system of the City of
Wooster for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems.  On demand
the owner, lessees, or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
Utilities Manager any information which he or she may request regarding the
piping system or systems or water use on such property.  The refusal of such
information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Utilities
Manager, be deemed evidence of the presence of improper connections as provided
in this section.
   (e)   The Utilities Manager of the City of Wooster is hereby authorized and
directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant and/or
property owner, the water service to any property where any connection in
violation of the provisions of this section is known to exist, and to take such
other precautionary measures as he or she may deem necessary to eliminate any
danger of contamination of the public water supply distribution mains.  Water
service to such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been
eliminated or corrected, in compliance with the provisions of this section.  In
the event that water service cannot be discontinued due to safety or liability
constraints, the property owner may be assessed fines in accordance with
Section
921.99 until the violation is eliminated. 
(Ord. 2017-24.  Passed 9-5-17.)
   921.08  PRIVATE WATER WELLS.
   Any property that is served with City water shall not also be served by a
private water well, unless the water service is properly designed to comply
with the City's cross connection and backflow prevention requirements,
including the installation of an approved backflow assembly and having
inspections and testing made of the assembly.  In all other cases, the property
owner shall be responsible for properly plugging and abandoning any private
water well(s) on the property following connection to City water.

cleaned by.  The users of grease traps/interceptors shall allow the City
representative to see the log and/or inspect the trap/interceptor at any
reasonable time.  If it is found that the trap/interceptor needs to be cleaned,
the City shall so order in writing.  If the trap/interceptor is not cleaned in
an approved manner within seven calendar days, the City may shut the water off
to the building or proceed according to law to prosecute the owner.
By January 31 of each year, the owners of grease trap/interceptors shall submit
a copy of the maintenance and inspection log for the previous calendar year to
the City.
      (10)   Liability of owner for blockages.  If blockages occur in the sewer

agreement with the user responsible for noncompliance.  Such orders will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
with a time period specified by the order.
         C.   Administrative order.  When City staff find that a user has
violated or continues to violate the provisions set forth in this program, or
the order issued thereunder, s/he may issue an order for compliance to the user
responsible for the discharge.  Orders may contain any requirements as might be
reasonable, necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
but not limited to the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring and management practices.
         D.   Emergency suspension of services.  The City may suspend water or
sewer service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of City staff,
in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which:
            1.   Presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment;
            2.   Causes stoppages, sanitary sewer overflows, or excessive
maintenance to be performed to prevent stoppages in the sanitary sewer
collection system;
            3.   Causes interference to the POTW; or
            4.   Causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permits.
Any person notified of a suspension of the water or sewer service shall take
immediate steps to cease or eliminate the discharge.  In the event of a failure
of the person to promptly comply voluntarily with the suspension order, City
staff shall take such steps as they, in their discretion, deem necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or sewer connection or
endangerment to any individuals, including immediate termination of water or
sewer service.  City staff shall reinstate the water or sewer service when such
conditions causing the suspension have been eliminated and the reconnection fee
paid.  A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measure(s) taken to prevent any future
occurrence shall be submitted to City staff within fifteen days of the date of
occurrence.
         E.   Administrative penalty.  Notwithstanding any other remedies or
procedures available to the City, any user who is found to have violated any
provision of this program, or any order issued hereunder, may be assessed an
administrative penalty is an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000)
per violation, and each day of noncompliance shall be deemed a separate and
distinct violation.  Such assessment may be added to the user’s next scheduled
sewer service charge, and City staff shall have such other collection remedies
as are available at law.
         F.   Request for hearing and appeal.  Any person affected by a
penalty, order or directive of the City issued pursuant to this program may,

in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA or the City.
         E.    Except as indicated in subparagraphs F. and G. below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized, the samples must be representative of
the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as
follows: for hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the
samples may be composited in a laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
Superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous limits.
         F.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques. Alternately, pH compliance may be assessed through the
use of a strip-chart or a circular chart over the monitoring period from a
continuous pH recorder, at the discretion of the Superintendent.
         G.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
initial compliance reports required in Section
923.06 and 40 CFR 503.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfides, and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist. For facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For reports required by Section
923.06 and 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
         H.   If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis
conducted by the City in lieu of the industrial user, the City shall perform
the repeat sampling and analysis within thirty days of becoming aware of the
violation unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to
perform the repeat sampling and analysis.
         I.   Where a pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as
required by the Director or applicable standard.

   (i)    Confidential Information.
      (1)    Information and data furnished to the City with respect to the
nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the discharger specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information
of the discharger.
      (2)   When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of
a report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State disposal system
permit and/or the pretreatment program. Wastewater constitutents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
Information accepted by the City as confidential, shall not be transmitted to

period of time, as determined by the City, cease all discharges. In the event
of failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order,
the City shall commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel
the discharger's compliance with such order. The City shall reinstate the
industrial discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service and
terminate the aforementioned judicial proceedings pending proof by the
discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions
creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. The
City reserves the right to reject, or surcharge, or require pretreatment of, or
contract for, the treatment and disposal of waste.

termination of wastewater treatment services or revocation of its industrial
discharge permit, pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, the City shall serve or
cause to be served upon such discharger, a written notice either personally or
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature
of the alleged violation. Within fourteen days of the date of receipt of the

per billing period, one gallon times 8.34. If the average concentration of COD
is of normal sewage, or less, no surcharge for COD shall apply.
   (e)    Pounds of suspended solids per billing period subject to surcharge
equals: (Average concentration of suspended solids, calculated pursuant to
Chapter
923, in milligrams per liter minus normal sewage suspended solids per liter)
times the volume of wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater
treatment works per billing period, in one gallon times 8.34. If the average

treatment services will pay its proportionate share of the cost of operation
and maintenance including replacement. Revenue generated shall be proportionate
to the portion of operation and maintenance. These rates shall be reviewed
annually and shall be revised periodically, as required, to reflect actual
treatment works' operation and maintenance costs.
   In conjunction with a regular bill, each user shall receive an annual
notification outlining their sewer service charge. This notification shall
include a breakdown of the capital charges, sewer use rates, service charges
and extra-strength surcharges for the previous year for that user. (Ord. 1988-
10. Passed 2-1-88.)

sanitary sewer charges shall be audited annually. All estimated revenues,
expenses, consumptions, loadings, allocation factors, etc. shall be reviewed
and adjusted annually so as to more accurately reflect current conditions and
adjust for past inequities. One of the main purposes of the audit shall be to
maintain a proportionate distribution of the wastewater treatment works'
operation and maintenance costs, including billing, to all users by means of
the user charge system, and to insure that user charges are sufficient to cover
all operation and maintenance costs, including billing. Within the limitations
of all applicable Federal, State and local laws, the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency shall have the right to audit industrial waste discharge
records.
(Ord. 1988-10. Passed 2-1-88.)
   924.08  EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHARGES.
   The sanitary sewer charges established shall commence when the building,
structure or other facility is connected to a sewer having its ultimate outlet
at the City WWTP, or as of the date 120 days following the date on which the
City notifies the owner of such premises that the sewer is available for making
such connection, whichever date first occurs and such charges shall be payable

discharged either directly or indirectly to the sewerage system, the City
Engineer shall determine the sewer charges for the user; or the owner or other
interested party, at his expense, may install and maintain a meter or meters
acceptable to the Department of Service for the purpose of determining such
sewer charges. In buildings where only part of the building is serviced by City
sewer, until such time as the sewer is available, the sewer bill shall be on a
prorated basis as determined by the City Engineer. In any event, the sewer
charge shall be at least equal to the minimum charge applicable from this

   (b)    A Grantee shall maintain a repair and maintenance crew capable of
responding to subscriber complaints within a normal service interval provided
that the subscriber or his/her representative is available during this period
at the premises to be serviced. No charge shall be made to the subscriber for

   (c)    Any verbal, telephonic or written complaint relating to the quality
or continuity of service shall be attended to within a normal service interval.
   (d)    A Grantee shall establish procedures for receiving, acting upon and

date and time of customer complaints, identifying the subscriber, and
describing the nature of the complaints and when and what action was taken by
the Grantee in response thereto. Such records reflecting operational
performance shall be kept for a minimum of two years at the Grantee's local
office and be made available during regular business hours.
   (e)   Upon request, Grantee shall credit a subscriber's account for each
full day that service is not restored beyond the normal service interval,

be granted for total loss of service or loss of an entire level of service.
Credit shall not be granted under the following conditions:
      (1)    Disconnection for nonpayment of service.
      (2)    Disconnection upon request after the beginning of a billing
period.
      (3)    Grantee is unable to gain access to the subscriber's residence at
reasonable times.
   This provision shall not apply if such delay is occasioned because of an Act
of God, strike, national emergency, or any other circumstance beyond the
control of the Grantee.
   Similarly, this provision shall not apply to service requests or complaints
pertaining to television set malfunction or other breakdowns not related to the
operation of the cable television system.  (Ord.  2000-32.  Passed 7-10-00.)
   947.14  CONDITIONS OF STREET OCCUPANCY.
   (a)    All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment
erected by a Grantee within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum
interference with the proper use of streets, alleys or other public ways and
places and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners who join any of such streets, alleys or other
public ways and places. All cable television systems shall be constructed and
operated in compliance with all adopted local and national construction codes.
   (b)   A Grantee shall not erect, nor authorize or permit others to erect any
poles or other facilities within the streets of the City for the conduct of its
cable television system, but shall use the existing poles and other equipment
of the appropriate electrical power and telephone or other utility companies
under such terms and agreements as the Grantee shall negotiate with these
companies.
   Exceptions may be permitted by the Service Director under such conditions as
he shall prescribe for the public welfare. Such permission may be granted only
when absolutely necessary to service a customer and not simply because it is
more convenient, economical or profitable for the Grantee to so operate. The
permission shall be reduced to writing.
   (c)    Should a Grantee be required to place any lines or other equipment on
any boulevard, parkway or other property under the jurisdiction of the
Department of Service, the manner of placement and location thereof shall be
subject to the control of the Service Director.
   (d)    Whenever, in the conduct of its business, a Grantee is required to
locate its property within the streets of the City, other than the property
which may be attached to utility poles as described in subsection (b) hereof,
permission to so locate must be obtained from the Service Director before the
Grantee may install or permit any other person to install such property.
   The Grantee shall disclose to the Service Director the nature of such
property, the need to locate within the street and the street name. The Service
Director shall prescribe any conditions concerning location or installation as
he deems necessary.
   (e)   Whenever the City, County or State shall reasonably require relocation
or reinstallation of any property of a Grantee in any of the streets of the
City, it shall be the obligation of the Grantee upon notice of such
requirements to remove and relocate or reinstall such property within seventy-
two hours. Such relocation, removal or reinstallation by the Grantee shall be
at the sole cost of the Grantee.
   (f)   Whenever all or any part of both the electric and telephone utilities
are located underground, it shall be the obligation of the Grantee to locate
its property within the City also underground. If both the electric and
telephone utilities locate their properties underground after the Grantee has
previously installed aboveground properties, the Grantee shall, nevertheless,
at the same time or immediately thereafter, remove and relocate its properties
underground in such places.
   The Service Director may permit such properties to remain above ground even
though other facilities are placed underground in the area upon being satisfied
that the Grantee is unable, for operational reasons only, to locate or relocate
its property underground. Such permission may be granted only upon such
conditions as the Service Director may require for public health and welfare.
   Whenever a property owner requests that facilities of a Grantee be placed
underground in an area where electric or telephone facilities are aerial the
property owner shall pay the additional expense of the installation.
   (g)   A Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging
streets of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with Grantee's wires and cables, all trimming to be done under the
supervision and direction of the City and at the expense of the Grantee.
   (h)   In case of disturbance of any street caused by a Grantee, the Grantee
shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the Service
Director, replace and restore such street in as good a condition as before the
work involving such disturbance was done.
   (i)   A Grantee shall, upon request of any person hording a building moving
permit issued by the City, temporarily remove, raise or lower its wires to
permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or
raising or lowering of the wires shall be paid by the person requesting the
same, and the Grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in
advance. The Grantee shall be given not less than seventy-two hours advance
notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. (Ord. 1985-18. Passed 6-3-
85.)
   947.15  GRANTEE'S DUTY TO REMOVE ITS PROPERTIES FROM THE PUBLIC STREETS.
   (a)    Except those facilities and equipment necessary to provide service to
areas outside the City, Grantee shall promptly remove from the public streets
where its properties are located any part of its facilities so located when the
following conditions occur:
      (1)    The facilities have not been used to serve subscribers for a
period of 180 days, and
      (2)    The facilities have no foreseeable future use for providing
service to current or potential subscribers. The above is in addition to any
remedies available for facilities and equipment not maintained in a manner that
is consistent with any other provisions contained in this chapter.

via registered mail of any occurrence provided for in subsection (b) hereof.
Within 180 days following the receipt of such notice, the Grantee shall find an
acceptable party to purchase the facilities, pursuant to Section
947.21.
      (2)    Upon the Grantee's failure to locate an acceptable party, the City
shall have the opportunity to acquire ownership of the system or effect
transfer of ownership of the system to another party pursuant to Section 627 of
The Act. Such acquisition or transfer shall be under terms and conditions equal
to or exceeding the terms and conditions contained herein.
      (3)    Should the City decide not to acquire the system or transfer
ownership to another party, the Grantee, shall within ninety days remove from
the streets of the City upon, over and under which its properties are located
all of such properties, except those facilities that are necessary to provide
service to areas outside the City, unless otherwise authorized and permitted by
the Director of Administration.
      (4)    The Director of Administration may declare abandoned any property
of the Grantee remaining in place ninety days after notification that the City
does not wish to acquire or transfer ownership to another party, except those
facilities that are necessary for providing service to areas outside the City,
and the same shall be considered permanently abandoned property unless the
Director of Administration extends the time for removal of such property.
   (d)   Any property abandoned by a Grantee as hereinabove provided shall
become the property of the City. The Grantee agrees to execute and deliver an
instrument in writing transferring its ownership interest in any such property
to the City, provided that any notice given the Grantee by the Director of
Administration as provided in this section shall be deemed notice to any other
persons claiming interest in such property of the Grantee, and such persons
shall be subject to all the provisions hereinbefore provided. In no event shall
the City resume active operation of the Grantee's abandoned property or allow
another party to resume active operation of the Grantee's abandoned property.

   The purpose of this chapter is to establish general procedures, rules, and
standards, consistent with all applicable federal, state, and local laws for
the siting, construction, installation, collocation, modification, operation,
and removal of small cell facilities and wireless support structures in the
City's public way.
   This chapter intends to:
   (a)   Establish basic criteria for requests to locate small cell facilities

time amend the Design Guidelines, the Facility License Agreement, and other
associated materials to provide clear information to applicants;
   (b)   Ensure that small cell facilities and wireless support structures are
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer in use in conformance with all applicable health and safety regulations;
   (c)     Preserve the character of the City of Wooster by minimizing the
potentially adverse visual impact of small cell facilities and wireless support
structures through careful design, siting, landscaping and camouflaging
techniques to blend these facilities into their environment to the maximum
extent practicable;
   (d)     Enhance the ability of wireless communications carriers to deploy
small cell facilities and wireless support structures in the City quickly,
effectively, and efficiently so that residents, businesses, and visitors
benefit from ubiquitous and robust wireless service availability;
   (e)     Establish an application and work permit process and structure for
payment of fees and charges to be uniformly applied to all applicants,
operators, and owners of small cell facilities and wireless support structures
for such facilities;
   (f)     Comply with, and not conflict with or preempt, all applicable state
and federal laws, including without limitation Section 101(a) and Section 704
of the Telecommunications Act, Pub. L. 104-104, 101 Stats. 56, 70 (Feb. 8,

invalidate proceedings pursuant to the notice if a bona fide attempt has been
made to comply with applicable notice requirements.  Minor defects in notice
shall be limited to errors in a legal description, typographical or grammatical
errors, or errors of actual acreage that do not impede communication of the
notice to affected parties.  Failure of a party to receive written notice shall
not invalidate subsequent action.  In all cases, however, the requirements for
the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date, and place of a
hearing shall be strictly construed.  If questions arise at the hearing
regarding the adequacy of notice, the decision-making body shall direct the
department having responsibility for notification to make a formal finding as
to whether there was substantial compliance with the notice requirements of
this code, and such finding shall be made available to the decision-making body
prior to final action on the request.

and/or posting of notices as required by this chapter, it shall be presumed
that notice of a public hearing was given as required by this section.

provided, or is incorrectly provided (excluding minor issues addressed in
Subsection
1105.02(h)(7), above), due to an error outside of the applicant's control, the
hearing or meeting shall be rescheduled for the next regularly scheduled
meeting or may be rescheduled as a special meeting at the discretion of the
applicable review board or City Council.
   (i)   Conduct of Public Meetings and Hearings.
      (1)   Rights of All Persons.  Any person may appear at a public hearing
and submit information or evidence, either individually or as a representative
of a person or an organization.  Each person who appears at a public hearing
shall be identified, state his or her address, and if appearing on behalf of a
person or organization, state the name and mailing address of the person or
organization being represented.
      (2)   Continuance of a Public Meeting or Hearing, or Deferral of
Application Review.
         A.   An applicant may request that a review or decision-making body's
consideration of an application at a public hearing be deferred by submitting a
written request for deferral to the Zoning Administrator prior to the
publication of notice as may be required by this code. The Zoning Administrator
may grant such requests, in which case, the application will be considered at
the next regularly scheduled meeting.
         B.   A request for deferral of consideration of an application
received by the Zoning Administrator after publication of notice of the public
hearing as required by this code shall be considered as a request for a
continuance of the public hearing, and may only be granted by the review or
decision-making body.
         C.   The review or decision-making body conducting the public hearing
may, on its own motion or at the request of the applicant, continue the public
hearing to a fixed date, time, and place. No additional notice is required if
the fixed date, time, and place is announced at the time of the continuance.
      (3)   Tabling or Continuation of Public Meetings or Hearings by a Review
Board or City Council.  If any review procedure is tabled or continued by a
review board or City Council for a period that exceeds six months, the
application shall be deemed as denied and the applicant shall be required to
resubmit an application or may appeal the denial.
   (j)   Withdrawal of Application.  Any request for withdrawal of an
application shall be either submitted in writing to the Zoning Administrator or
made through a verbal request by the applicant prior to action by the review or
decision-making body.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall approve a request for withdrawal of
an application if it has been submitted prior to publication of notice for the
public hearing on the application in accordance with this code.
      (2)   If the request for withdrawal of an application is submitted after
publication of notice for the public hearing in accordance with this code, the
request for withdrawal shall be placed on the public hearing agenda and acted
upon by the review or decision-making body. Such action shall not be deemed as
a decision on the subject application.
   (k)   Examination and Copying of Application and Other Documents.  Documents
and/or records may be inspected and/or copied as provided for by State law. At
a minimum, the documents and/or records shall be available in the office of the
Zoning Administrator during the same time that notice is required in Table
1105-1.
   (l)   Effect of any Approvals.
      (1)   The issuance of any approval, certificate, or permit under this
code shall authorize only the particular development, alteration, construction,
or use approved in the subject application.
      (2)   All approvals shall run with the land or use and shall not be
affected by change in ownership.
   (m)   Amendments of Approved Applications.
      (1)   Minor Amendments.
         A.   For any review procedure, the Zoning Administrator is authorized
to allow minor changes related to design of an approved application where the
change is insignificant and has minimal impact to the overall design of the
development or subdivision. This shall not give the Zoning Administrator the
authority to vary the requirements of this code or any conditions of approval.
         B.   In cases where the proposed minor amendment is related to a
public improvement or another element that the City Engineer has authority
over, the City Engineer shall have the same authority to authorize minor
changes.
      (2)   Unless otherwise stated, any approval granted through the
provisions of this code may be otherwise be amended, extended, or modified only
in accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original
approval. 
   (n)   Reapplication after Denial of an Application.  If an application is
denied, the applicant may:
      (1)   Appeal the decision in accordance with the applicable appeals
procedure established in this code; or
      (2)   Make changes to the application that will fully address all issues
and findings identified for the denial and resubmit a new application,
including any required fees. Any such resubmission must contain evidence that
shows how the new application has substantially changed to address each of the
findings of the original decision. The Zoning Administrator shall have the
authority to determine if the evidence submitted substantially changes the
application to address all issues as part of the complete application
determination in Section
1105.02(c)(3). If it does not, the Zoning Administrator shall return the
application, with reasons for their determination in writing, along with any
paid fees; or
      (3)   Submit a new application if the proposed use and design of the site
will be entirely different than the denied application. 
   (o)   Subsequent Development.
      (1)   Development authorized by any approval under this section and this
code shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other
approvals required by this code or any other applicable provisions of the City.
      (2)   The granting of any approval, certificate, or permit shall not
guarantee the approval of any other required certificate, permit, or
application.
      (3)   The City shall not be responsible for reviewing the application for
compliance with any permits, certificates, or other approvals that may be
required by the Wayne County, State, or other agencies having jurisdiction.
   (p)   Computation of Time.
      (1)   In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this code,
the date of the application, act, decision, or event, from which the designated
period of time begins shall not be included. The last date of the period of
time to be computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a
legal holiday, in which case the period runs until the end of the next day
which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday as observed by the City
of Wooster where the City administrative offices are closed for the entire day.
      (2)   When the period of time prescribed is less than seven days,
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded from the
computation (i.e., business days and not calendar days).
      (3)   When the City offices are closed to the public for the entire day
which constitutes the last day of the period of time, then such application,
act, decision, or event may be performed on the next succeeding day which is
not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday observed by the City of Wooster in
which the City administrative offices are closed for the entire day.

            (Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1105.04  CONDITIONAL USE REVIEW.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of a conditional use procedure is to allow
consideration for certain uses that due to the use's unique and special nature
relative to location, design, size, operations, circulation, and general impact
on the community, need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   This section shall apply to all applications for establishment of a
new conditional use.
      (2)   This section shall also apply to any proposed change, modification,
enlargement, or alteration of an approved conditional use, or the site
development conditions, or operations of an approved conditional use unless the
Zoning Administrator determines that the alteration is minor in nature, in
which case, the alteration can be reviewed through the zoning certificate
application.
   (c)   Existing Used Deemed a Conditional Use.  Any lawfully existing use
that, at the time of its establishment, was not classified as a conditional
use, but which now, because of the passage of an amendment to this code, is
listed as a conditional use in the district in which it is located, shall be
deemed without further action to be an approved conditional use.
   (d)   Conditional Use Review Procedure.  The review procedure for a
conditional use review shall be as established in this section. A pre-
application meeting (See Section
1105.02(e)) is encouraged, but not mandatory, prior to submission of the
application.
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.  The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1105.02, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Staff Review and Transmission to the Planning Commission.
         A.   Upon determination that a conditional use application is
complete, the Zoning Administrator shall distribute the application to all
appropriate City departments and professional consultants for review and
comment. Any comments or expert opinions shall be returned to the Zoning
Administrator for transmission to the Planning Commission.
         B.   The Zoning Administrator shall distribute the application and any
reports prepared as part of Subsection
1105.04(d)(2)A prior to the Planning Commission's meeting where the application
is to be reviewed.
      (3)   Step 3 - Planning Commission Review and Decision.
         A.   Within 60 days after the application is determined to be
complete, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
conditional use application.
         B.   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall at a
minimum, consider the reports and opinions transmitted by the Zoning
Administrator and the review criteria of this section.
         C.   Notification of the public hearing shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1105.02(h).
         D.   In making its decision, the Planning Commission may approve,
approve with modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the
application.
         E.   If the Planning Commission fails to act within 60 days from the
date of the initial public hearing, or an extended period as may be agreed upon
by the Planning Commission and applicant, then the application shall be
considered denied.
   (e)   Review Criteria.  Decisions on a conditional use application shall be
based on consideration of the following review criteria. All conditional uses
shall be subject to review under the criteria of this section, as applicable,
and may be subject to additional use-specific standards established in Chapter
1109: Principal Use Regulations.
      (1)   The proposed conditional use is established as an allowed
conditional use in the applicable zoning district;
      (2)   The proposed use and design is consistent with the spirit, purpose
and intent of the comprehensive plan and the general purpose of this code;
      (3)   The proposed use complies with any use-specific standards as may be
established for the use;
      (4)   Any building or structure constructed, reconstructed, or altered as
part of a conditional use in a residential zoning district shall, to the
maximum extent feasible, have an exterior appearance that the Planning
Commission deems compatible with surrounding residential buildings in scale,
height, and building materials.
      (5)   The conditional use shall have suitable landscaping, screening, and
fencing wherever deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to protect
surrounding uses;
      (6)   The proposed use will comply with all applicable development
standards;
      (7)   The proposed use will be harmonious with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity, and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
      (8)   The proposed use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to
any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production
of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, or odors;
      (9)   The circulation on and access to the property shall be so designed
as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares;
      (10)   The design of the buildings, structures, and site will not result
in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic, or historic feature of
major importance;
      (11)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in
the district; and
      (12)   Wherever no specific areas, frontage, height, or setback
requirements are specified in the requirements for a specific conditional use,
then such use shall be subject to the site development standards for the
applicable zoning district.
   (f)   Additional Criteria and Conditions.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall be authorized to waive or modify
requirements that apply to the conditional use as may be necessary to achieve
compatible development with adjacent land areas and use as well as in the
interest of the community in general where the Planning Commission finds that
such waiver or modification will further the protection of the general welfare,
protect individual property rights, and ensure that the conditional use will
meet the intent and purposes of this code. 
      (2)   The Planning Commission may also impose additional conditions,
guarantees, and safeguards as it deems necessary to protect the general welfare
and individual property rights, and to ensure that the conditional use will
meet the intent and purposes of this code. 
      (3)   All activities, programs and other events proposed on plans shall
be directly related to the conditional use so granted, and shall be adequately
and properly supervised so as to prevent any hazard and to assure against any
disturbance or nuisance to surrounding properties, residents or to the
community in general.
   (g)   Revocation of a Conditional Use Approval.  The breach of any
condition, safeguard, or requirement shall automatically invalidate the
conditional use approval, and shall constitute a violation of this code.  Such
violation shall be punishable as specified in Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (h)   Existing Use Reclassified as a Conditional Use.  In the event an
existing use that was permitted by right at the time the use was established is
thereafter reclassified as a conditional use in the applicable district due to
a zoning text amendment, such use shall be considered to be an approved
conditional use without any further action.  However, any subsequent change to
such use shall require review and approval by the Planning Commission in
accordance with this section. Such use, provided it is conditionally permitted
in the applicable district, shall not be considered a nonconforming use.
   (i)   Time Limit.
      (1)   A conditional use approval shall be deemed to authorize only one
particular conditional use and said permit shall automatically expire if, for
any reason, the conditional use shall cease for more than one year.

   1105.05  MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of the minor subdivision process is to allow for
small subdivisions of land, consolidation of lots, or transfer of a portion of
a lot to an adjacent lot where there will not be the creation of a new street,
dedication of right-of-way (unless specifically allowed herein), or a need for
any public improvements.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, a minor subdivision is a lot
split, lot consolidation, or transfer of land between adjacent property owners
that complies with all of the following requirements:
         A.   The proposed subdivision is located along an existing public
street and involves no opening of any new street or the widening or extension
of an existing street or the installation of any other public improvements;
         B.   The subdivision shall not result in or create more than five lots
after the original parcels have been completely subdivided;
         C.   The subdivision shall be in compliance with all applicable site
development standards in this code or with any approved variance from such
standards;
         D.   The subdivision shall not require the installation or
modification of any public improvements;
         E.   The subdivision shall not require the dedication of rights-of-way
except in cases where all other applicability requirements of this section are
met and:
            i.   The lots were not originally platted within the City of
Wooster but includes a right-of-way easement; or
            ii.   When a minor right-of-way dedication is required by the City
Engineer but there are no related public improvements.
         F.   The property has been surveyed and a survey sheet or record plan,
in the form provided for in this code, and a full legal description of the
changes resulting from the split, are submitted with the application; and
         G.   No landlocking of parcels shall occur as a result of the minor
subdivision.
      (2)   A minor subdivision also includes the recombination of land,
consolidation of lots, transfer of property from one lot to an adjacent lot,
and for the dedication of additional land for the widening of existing streets,
where no new lots are created.
      (3)   The use of panhandle (flag) lots in any application shall require
approval by the Planning Commission through a major subdivision review.
   (c)   Sale of Land in Subdivisions, Start of Construction, and Permitting.
      (1)   No owner, or authorized agent, of any land located within a
subdivision shall transfer, sell, agree to sell or negotiate to sell any land
by reference to, by exhibition of, or by the use of, a plan or plat of a
subdivision, nor proceed with any construction work before such plan or plat
has been approved and recorded in the manner prescribed in these regulations. 
      (2)   Any sale or transfer contrary to the provisions of this section is
void.  The description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or
transferring shall not exempt the transaction from the provisions of these
regulations.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall not issue zoning certificates for
any structure or activity on a lot in a subdivision for which a plat has not
been approved and recorded in the manner prescribed in these regulations.
      (4)   No owner or agent of the owner of any land shall be entitled to a
permit for the installation of wells and septic tanks upon any lots in a
subdivision for which a plat has not been approved, certified, and recorded in
the manner prescribed in Chapter in this section. 
   (d)   Minor Subdivision Review Procedure.   The review procedure for a minor
subdivision shall be as established in this section.
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.
         A.   The applicant shall submit an application in accordance with
Section
1105.02, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   If the minor subdivision involves the transfer of land area from
one lot to an adjacent lot, both property owners shall be required to authorize
the application and deeds or other instruments of conveyance shall be submitted
for both lots.
      (2)   Step 2 - Review and Comment by Applicable Agencies.
         A.   Upon determination that the application for a minor subdivision
is complete, the Zoning Administrator may transmit copies of the application
for review by applicable agencies including, but not limited to, the City
Engineer and any other agencies having authority over streets, water, sewer,
gas, or other utilities and other public improvements.
         B.   Such agencies may supply comments, recommendations, and approvals
as applicable, to the Zoning Administrator for consideration prior to the
Zoning Administrator's decision (Step 3).
      (3)   Step 3 - Review and Decision by the Zoning Administrator.
         A.   Within 30 days of the determination that the application (Step 1)
is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall review the application and approve,
approve with modifications that will bring the application into compliance with
codes, or deny the application for a minor subdivision based on the review
criteria established below. An extension on the decision may be granted with
approval from the applicant.
         B.   In reviewing the minor subdivision, the Zoning Administrator, on
recommendation of the City Engineer, may require the addition of easements and/
or setbacks as part of a transfer of land area between two lots.
         C.   If the application is approved with modifications, the applicant
shall be required to revise all documents prior to final signing and recording.
         D.   If the Zoning Administrator denies an application for a minor
subdivision, the Zoning Administrator shall provide the applicant with written
finding for the denial.
   (e)   Review Criteria.  In order to approve a minor subdivision, the Zoning

      (1)   That the minor subdivision complies with all applicable provisions
of this code;
      (2)   That the minor subdivision complies with all other applicable
regulations and plans of the City; and
      (3)   That the City Engineer and any other applicable review agencies
have no objections that cannot be resolved by the applicant.
   (f)   Recording.
      (1)   When the application is approved, the Zoning Administrator and City
Engineer shall sign and date the plat.
      (2)   The subdivider shall then be responsible for submitting the signed
conveyance with the Wayne County Auditor for the transfer of property and to
the Wayne County Recorder for the recording of the lots as legal lots of record
and providing a copy of said minor subdivision/plat to the Zoning Administrator
after recording.
      (3)   In the case of a transfer of land between two adjacent lots, the
recording of the revised lots shall take place simultaneously.
   (g)   Administrative Waivers and Variances.  If a deviation from the minimum
site development standards (e.g., lot area, lot width, etc.) is required, the
applicant will be required to receive all variance and/or administrative waiver
approvals  (See Section
1105.11 or Section
1105.12(f).) prior to approval of the minor subdivision.
   (h)   Time Limit.  If the subdivider does not record the minor subdivision
within 90 days of signed approval, the minor subdivision approval will be void.
After a minor subdivision approval is voided, any new subdivision will require
a new application and related fees in accordance with this code.
   (i)   Appeals.   Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Zoning Administrator shall have the right to appeal the
decision to the BZA as established in Section
1105.13. 
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18; Ord. 2019-17.  Passed 10-7-19.)
   1105.06  MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of the major subdivision process is to provide a
method of review for any subdivision that exceeds the scope of a minor
subdivision and which includes multiple lots, the creation or expansion of new
streets, and/or the installation of public improvements. 
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   Any subdivision of land or replat of an existing subdivision that
does not meet the applicability requirements of a minor subdivision in Section
1105.05(b) shall be subject to the requirements of this section and require the
submission and approval of a concept plan, preliminary subdivision plat, and a
final subdivision plat.
      (2)   The requirement to submit a concept plan or preliminary subdivision
may be waived by the Zoning Administrator after a pre-application meeting with
the applicant if the Zoning Administrator finds that the subdivision is of a
size and scope that does not warrant concept plan or preliminary subdivision
review.
      (3)   Whenever a single parcel is proposed for development and the
installation of public improvements is required, such development shall require
the approval of a final subdivision plat.
      (4)   Planned Developments.  In order to provide efficient review of
planned developments, it is the intent of this section that subdivision review
be carried out simultaneously with the review of development plans for planned
developments, as noted below:
         A.   Preliminary development plan approval and preliminary subdivision
plat approval may proceed simultaneously.
         B.   Final development plan approval and final subdivision plat
approval shall proceed simultaneously, unless a final subdivision plat is not
required for completion of the project. 
   (c)   Sale of Land in Subdivisions, Start of Construction, and Permitting.
      (1)   No owner, or authorized agent, of any land located within a
subdivision shall transfer, sell, agree to sell or negotiate to sell any land
by reference to, by exhibition of, or by the use of, a plan or plat of a
subdivision, nor proceed with any construction work before such plan or plat
has been approved and recorded in the manner prescribed in these regulations. 
      (2)   Any sale or transfer contrary to the provisions of this section is
void.  The description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or
transferring shall not exempt the transaction from the provisions of these
regulations.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall not issue zoning certificates for
any structure or activity on a lot in a subdivision for which a plat has not
been approved and recorded in the manner prescribed in these regulations.
      (4)   No owner or agent of the owner of any land shall be entitled to a
permit for the installation of wells and septic tanks upon any lots in a
subdivision for which a plat has not been approved, certified, and recorded in
the manner prescribed in Chapter in this section. 
   (d)   Major Subdivision Review Procedure.  The review procedure for a major
subdivision shall be as established in this section. A pre-application meeting
(See Section
1105.02(e)) is encouraged, but not mandatory, prior to submission of the
application for any of the required plans.
      (1)   Step 1 - Application and Filling of the Concept Plan.  The concept
plan is intended to outline the basic scope, character, and nature of a
proposed project, enable the applicant to discuss the location of proposed
streets, parkways, parks, playgrounds, school sites, and planned developments,
and to familiarize the applicant with the comprehensive plan, other adopted
plans applicable to the site, the requirements of this code, and the drainage,
sewerage and water systems for the City. The review is to provide input in the
formative stages of design.
         A.   The applicant shall submit an application in accordance with
Section
1105.02, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   Upon determination by the Zoning Administrator that the
application is complete, the concept plan shall be accepted as being officially
filed.
      (2)   Step 2 - Staff Review and Transmission to the Planning Commission.
         A.   Upon determination that the application for a concept plan is
complete, the Zoning Administrator may transmit copies of the application for
review by applicable agencies including, but not limited to, the City Engineer
and any other agencies having authority over streets, water, sewer, gas, or
other utilities and other public improvements.
         B.   During the course of its review, the staff may meet with the
applicant to review its evaluation, and the applicant may revise the concept
plan in response to staff's comments.
         C.   Any comments or expert opinions shall be returned to the Zoning
Administrator.
         D.   Within 30 days of the application being determined to be
complete, or an extended time period agreed upon by the applicant, the Zoning
Administrator shall distribute the application and any reports prepared as part
of Subsection
1105.06(d)(2)A, above, to the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Step 3 - Review and Decision on the Concept Plan by the Planning
Commission.
         A.   Within 60 days after the application is determined to be
complete, the Planning Commission shall review the concept plan application.
         B.   In making its decision, the Planning Commission shall approve,
approve with modifications, or deny the concept plan. The Planning Commission
may also continue the meeting if questions regarding the concept plan are not
satisfactorily addressed by the applicant.
         C.   If the Planning Commission fails to act within 60 days from the
date of the initial meeting regarding the concept plan application, or an
extended period as may be agreed upon by the Planning Commission and applicant,
then the application shall be considered denied.
         D.   If the Planning Commission finds that the land proposed to be
subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, poor or
inadequate drainage, topography, inadequate water or sanitary sewer service,
traffic circulation systems, or other such conditions that may endanger health,
life or property; and, if from investigations conducted by the public agencies
concerned, it is determined that in the best interest of the public, the land
should not be developed for the proposed purpose, the Planning Commission shall
deny the approval of the concept plan unless adequate methods are advanced by
the applicant for solving the problems that will be created by the development
of the land.
         E.   If the Planning Commission denies the concept plan, the applicant
shall not move forward in the review process until a concept plan is approved
by the Planning Commission.
         F.   In the event the Planning Commission denies the concept plan or
approves with modifications, the Zoning Administrator, on behalf of the
Planning Commission, shall provide the subdivider with a statement in writing
setting forth the reasons for the deny or the conditions of approval. In the
case of approval with modifications, the applicant shall be required to revise
the concept plan to address the conditions of approval and submit them to the
Zoning Administrator prior to submitting the preliminary subdivision plat
application.
         G.   Approval of the concept plan by the Planning Commission does not
constitute approval of the subdivision, but is merely an authorization to
proceed with the preparation of the preliminary subdivision plat.
         H.   The applicant shall be required to submit a complete preliminary
subdivision plat application within 12 months after the date of approval of the
concept plan, otherwise the concept plan approval shall be considered void
unless an extension is requested by the developer and granted by the Planning
Commission in writing. If the concept plan is voided, any new request to
subdivide the land shall require a new concept plan application in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
      (4)   Step 4 - Application, Filing, and Staff Review of the Preliminary
Subdivision Plat.
         A.   An application for a preliminary subdivision plat review shall be
submitted in the same manner as the concept plan. See Section
1105.06(d)(1).
         B.   Preliminary subdivision plats are required to be prepared,
signed, and sealed by an engineer or surveyor licensed in the State of Ohio.
         C.   The staff review and distribution of the application for a
preliminary subdivision plat shall be accomplished in the same manner as
established for a concept plan in Section
1105.06(d)(2).
         D.   Within 30 days of the application being determined to be
complete, or an extended time period agreed upon by the applicant, the Zoning
Administrator shall distribute the application and any reports prepared as part
of Subsection
1105.06(d)(4)A, to the Planning Commission.

         A.   Within 60 days after the application is determined to be
complete, the Planning Commission shall review the preliminary subdivision plat
application.
         B.   In its review of an application, the Planning Commission may
request additional information it deems necessary to adequately review and
evaluate the proposed subdivision, and/or may request the applicant to revise
elements of the application. When this occurs, the Planning Commission may
table the application.
         C.   In making its decision, the Planning Commission shall approve,
approve with modifications, or deny the preliminary subdivision plat and its
supporting document. The Planning Commission may also continue the meeting if
questions regarding the preliminary subdivision plat are not satisfactorily
addressed by the applicant.
         D.   If the Planning Commission fails to act within 60 days from the
date of the initial meeting regarding the preliminary plat application, or an
extended period as may be agreed upon by the Planning Commission and applicant,
then the application shall be considered denied.
         E.   The Planning Commission may require a reduction in the number of
lots proposed in a subdivision when it is determined necessary in order for the
preliminary subdivision plat to comply with the requirements of all applicable
City codes.
         F.   If the Planning Commission denies the preliminary subdivision
plat, the applicant shall not move forward in the review process until a
preliminary subdivision plat is approved by the Planning Commission.
         G.   In the event the Planning Commission denies the preliminary
subdivision plat or approves with modifications, the Zoning Administrator, on
behalf of the Planning Commission, shall provide the subdivider with a
statement in writing setting forth the reasons for the denial or the conditions
of approval. In the case of approval with modifications, the applicant shall be
required to revise the preliminary subdivision plat to address the conditions
of approval and submit them to the Zoning Administrator prior to submitting the
final subdivision plat application.
         H.   Approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the Planning
Commission does not constitute approval of the subdivision, but is merely an
authorization to proceed with the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
         I.   One record of the approved preliminary subdivision plat shall be
retained.
         J.   Approval of the preliminary subdivision plat is authorization for
the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of detailed plans and
specifications for the minimum improvements required in the subdivision
regulations, and with the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
         K.   The applicant shall be required to submit a complete final
subdivision plat application with 12 months after the date of approval of the
preliminary subdivision plat, otherwise the preliminary subdivision plat
approval shall be considered void unless an extension is requested by the
developer and granted by the Planning Commission in writing. If the preliminary
subdivision plat is voided, any new request to subdivide the land shall require
a new preliminary subdivision plat application in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
      (6)   Step 6 - Application, Filing, and Staff Review of the Final
Subdivision Plat
         A.   An application for a final subdivision plat review shall be
submitted in the same manner as the concept plan. See Section
1105.06(d)(1).
         B.   Final subdivision plats are required to be prepared, signed, and
sealed by an engineer or surveyor licensed in the State of Ohio.
         C.   If a preliminary subdivision plat has been previously approved,
the final subdivision plat shall have incorporated all changes in the
preliminary subdivision plat approval.
         D.   The staff review and distribution of the application for a final
subdivision plat shall be accomplished in the same manner as established for a
concept plan in Section
1105.06(d)(2).
         E.   Within 30 days of the application being determined to be
complete, or an extended time period agreed upon by the applicant, the Zoning
Administrator shall distribute the application and any reports prepared as part

shall occur simultaneously with or prior to the review of the final subdivision
plat.
            iii.   The City Engineer shall review the engineering plans and
construction drawings as well as the final subdivision plat. If the City
Engineer determines that the engineering plans and construction drawings comply
with the City's construction and material specifications and that the final
subdivision plat includes all of the necessary right-of-way and easement
dedications, the City Engineer shall grant preliminary approval of the
construction drawings.
            iv.   Other approvals from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
or other regulatory agencies shall be obtained after the City Engineer's
preliminary approval, when applicable.

homeowners' association covenants and restrictions shall be submitted for
review.
         C.   The Planning Commission shall approve, approve with conditions,
or deny the final subdivision plat. The Planning Commission may also continue
the meeting if questions regarding the plat are not satisfactorily addressed by
the applicant.
         D.   The Planning Commission shall make a decision within 60 days of
the filing of the final subdivision plat, engineering plans, and construction
drawings unless the Planning Commission has continued the meeting or if the
Planning Commission and subdivider agree to an extension of this time frame. If
the Planning Commission fails to act within this timeframe, or an approved
extension, then the application shall be considered denied.
         E.   If the Planning Commission denies the final subdivision plat, the
applicant shall not move forward in the review process until a final
subdivision plat is approved by the Planning Commission.
         F.   In the event the Planning Commission denies the final subdivision
plat application the Planning Commission shall provide the subdivider with a
statement in writing setting forth the reasons for the denial.
         G.   Approval of the final subdivision plat, engineering plans, and
construction drawings by the Planning Commission shall not be an acceptance by
the public of the offer of dedication of any street, or other public ways or
open space on the final subdivision plat unless they are accepted by the City
Council in the form of the adoption of an ordinance.
      (8)   Step 8 - Review and Decision on the Engineering Plans and
Construction Drawings by the City Engineer.
         A.   Following approval of the final subdivision plat, the subdivider
shall resubmit the engineering plans and construction drawings revised as
necessary to coincide with the approved final subdivision plat.
         B.   The City Engineer shall review the engineering plans and
constructions drawings and if found to be in total compliance with the approved

         C.   If the City Engineer determines that the improvements are
complete and have been constructed in compliance with these regulations, that
all conditions of the subdivision approval have been fulfilled and that all
required payments, including any payment in lieu of parkland dedication or open
space fee, have been made, the City Engineer shall issue a letter to the
applicant stating that the improvements are completed and acceptable for City
maintenance.
      (10)   Step 10 - Certification and Recording of the Final Subdivision
Plat.
         A.   Once the City Engineer determines the improvements are complete,
determined unnecessary prior to recording, or the applicant has provided the
financial guarantees required by this code, the Zoning Administrator and City
Engineer shall certify or sign the final subdivision plat. After the final
subdivision plat is certified, the final subdivision plat and all associated
covenants and restrictions shall be recorded in the office of the Wayne County
Recorder within one year of the date of signing.
         B.   No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled to record in the
office of the Wayne County Recorder or have any validity until the Planning
Commission shall have approved it, and it shall have been certified by the City
Engineer and the Zoning Administrator. In the event any such unapproved plat is
recorded, it shall be considered invalid and the City shall institute
proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of Wayne County.
   (e)   Review Criteria.
      (1)   Concept Plan Review Criteria.  Decisions on concept plan

improvements or design where there is minimal impact to the overall design of
the subdivision. This shall not give the Zoning Administrator or City Engineer
the authority to vary the requirements of this code.
      (4)   Before approval of the final subdivision plat, the submitted plat
may be withdrawn or modified.  If modified, the review process shall be
repeated. If the application is withdrawn, any application fees shall be
forfeited. 
      (5)   If during the course of construction, any changes or modifications
are encountered that are not in conformance with the original approved
engineering plans or construction drawings, the subdivider shall submit the
modified engineering plans or construction drawings to the City Engineer, who,
if in agreement with such modifications, shall affix their signature to these
drawings indicating approval of the modifications.
   (g)   Dedication of Improvements for Public Use.  If the final subdivision
plat indicates land for public use, such land shall be considered dedicated to
the City of Wooster after the final subdivision plat has been signed by the
City Engineer and the Zoning Administrator and recorded in the office of the
Wayne County Recorder.
   (h)   Subdivision Modifications.
      (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of a subdivision modification is to provide
limited relief from standards that apply to the subdivision of land including
standards for improvements. Subdivision modifications are intended for those
cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create a
practical difficulty or extraordinary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a
manner otherwise allowed under these regulations. It is not intended that
modifications be approved merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens
that the requirements of these regulations may impose on property owners or
subdividers in general.
      (2)   Applicability.
         A.   If the proposed subdivision requires a deviation from the minimum
site development standards (e.g., lot area, lot width, etc.) or other standards
identified in Chapter
1115: Site Development Standards, the applicant will be required to apply for
and receive all the necessary variance (See Section
1105.11.) or administrative waiver (See Section
1105.12(f).) approvals prior to approval of a preliminary subdivision plat.
         B.   If the applicant seeks a modification of standards required by
Chapter
1129: Subdivision Design, then the request for a modification shall be
accomplished through the procedure outlined in this section.
      (3)   Subdivision Modification Review.
         A.   A request for a subdivision modification shall be reviewed as
part of the preliminary subdivision plat review procedure but a public hearing
will be required with notice provided in accordance with Section
1105.02(h).
         B.   The Planning Commission shall review the request and may approve,
approve with conditions, or deny the request to modify any or all of the
modifications.
         C.   In approving a modification, the Planning Commission may impose
conditions on the approval as it determines are required to ensure compliance
with the provisions and purpose of these regulations. 
         D.   If the preliminary subdivision plat is denied or if the approval
of the preliminary subdivision plat expires, so does the approval of the
subdivision modification. Any future request for preliminary subdivision plat
approval that includes the same modifications shall require a new review and
decision on the request for modifications.
      (4)   Review Criteria.  The review criteria for a subdivision
modification shall be the same as those for a variance as established in
Section
1105.11(c).
   (i)   Appeals.  Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission shall have the right to appeal the
decision to the BZA as established in Section
1105.13.

standard established in this code provided it meets or exceeds the intent of
the design-related provisions of this code.  It is not a variance, waiver, or
weakening of regulations; rather, this procedure permits a site-specific plan
that is equal to or better than the strict application of a design standard
specified in this code.  An equivalency provision review approval shall apply
only to the specific site for which it is requested and does not establish a
precedent for assured approval of other requests.
   (b)   Applicability.  The equivalency provision review procedure shall be
available only for the following sections of this code:
      (1)   Section
1117.03: Exterior Lighting;

      (4)   Chapter
1125: Parking, Access, and Mobility; and
      (5)   Any design standards or guidelines that apply to a Landmark or
Landmark District.
   (c)   Review Board.
      (1)   Any equivalency provision review application related to a design
standard or guideline that applies to a Landmark or Landmark District shall be
reviewed by the Design Review Board.
      (2)   All other equivalency provision review applications shall be
reviewed by the Planning Commission.
   (d)   Review Timing.  A request for equivalency provision review shall be
made concurrently with a zoning certificate, development plan, or a COA
application, whichever is applicable. 
   (e)   Equivalency Provision Review Procedure.  The review procedure for any
equivalency provision review application shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.  The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1105.02, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Staff Review and Transmission to the Planning Commission

the Zoning Administrator for transmission to the Planning Commission or Design
Review Board, as applicable.
         B.   The Zoning Administrator shall distribute the application and any
reports prepared as part of Subsection

modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the application.
         E.   If the Planning Commission or Design and Review Board, as
applicable, fails to act within 60 days from the date of the initial meeting
regarding the equivalency provision review application, or an extended period
as may be agreed upon by the Planning Commission or Design and Review Board, as
applicable, and the applicant, then the application shall be considered denied.
         F.   If approved, any zoning certificate, development plan, COA, or
other related applications shall demonstrate compliance with the equivalency
provision review approval.
   (f)   Review Criteria. Decisions on an equivalency provision review
application shall be based on consideration of the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject
design or development standard to the same or better degree than the subject
standard;
      (2)   That the proposed alternative achieves the goals and policies of
the comprehensive plan to the same or better degree than the subject standard;
      (3)   That the proposed alternative results in benefits to the community

adjacent properties than would occur through compliance with the specific
requirements of this code.
   (g)   Conditions.  The Planning Commission or the Design and Review Board,
as applicable, may impose conditions on an approval for an equivalency
provision review provided such conditions are related to ensuring the
performance of the equivalency provision review to meet or exceed the subject
standard.  Such conditions may include required timeframes, amendments or
revisions to the proposal, or the ability to revoke an approval for an
equivalency provision review.
   (h)   Decisions.  Any decision on an equivalency provision review
application shall not be binding on the City related to future applications
requesting an alternative to any of the applicable standards.  Each case shall
be review and decided upon based on the individual circumstances.
   (i)   Time Limit.
      (1)   An approval of an equivalency provision review application shall
expire if the zoning certificate or certificate of appropriateness, as
applicable, expires.
      (2)   Upon expiration of an equivalency provision review approval, a new
application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new
application will be reviewed.
   (j)   Appeals.  Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission or the Design and Review Board, as
applicable, shall have the right to appeal the decision to the BZA as
established in Section
1105.13. 
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1105.11  VARIANCES.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of a variance is to provide limited relief from
the requirements of this code in those cases where strict application of a
particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this
code. It is not intended that a variance be granted merely to remove
inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this code may
impose of property owners in general. Variances are intended to address
extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused by the
applicant's act or omission.
   (b)   Variance Review Procedure.  The review procedure for a variance shall
be as established in this section. A pre-application meeting (See Section
1105.02(e).) is encouraged, but not mandatory, prior to submission of the
application.
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.  The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1105.02, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Staff Review and Transmission to the Planning Commission.
         A.   Upon determination that a variance application is complete, the
Zoning Administrator shall distribute the application to all appropriate City
departments and professional consultants for review and comment. Any comments
or expert opinions shall be returned to the Zoning Administrator for
transmission to the BZA.
         B.   The Zoning Administrator shall distribute the application and any
reports prepared as part of Subsection
1105.11(b)(2)A, prior to the BZA's meeting, as applicable, where the
application is to be reviewed.
      (3)   Step 3 - BZA Review and Decision.
         A.   Within 60 days after the application is determined to be
complete, BZA shall hold a public hearing on the variance application.
         B.   The BZA shall review the variance application during a public
hearing.
         C.   Notification of the public hearing shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1105.02(h).
         D.   In reviewing the application, the BZA shall at a minimum,
consider the reports and opinions transmitted by the Zoning Administrator and
the review criteria of this section.
         E.   The BZA may request that the applicant supply additional
information that the Board deems necessary to review and evaluate the request
for a variance.
         F.   In making its decision, the BZA may approve, approve with
modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the application.
         G.   In making its decision, the BZA shall make specific findings of
fact based directly on the particular evidence presented that the reasons set
forth in the application and as presented by the applicant during the public
hearing, justify the approval, approval with modifications or supplementary
conditions, or denial of the variance application that will make possible a
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
         H.   If the BZA fails to act within 60 days from the date of the
initial public hearing, or an extended period as may be agreed upon by the BZA
and applicant, then the application shall be considered denied.
         I.   The decision of the BZA shall become effective immediately.
         J.   In approving a variance, the BZA may impose conditions on the
approval, the proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant
to such approval as it determines are required to be ensure compliance with the
standards of this section and the purpose of this code. Any conditions
established by the BZA shall relate directly to the requested variance.
         K.   Any violation of the conditions of approval shall be a violation
of this code, subject to the enforcement and penalties of Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (c)   Review Criteria.
      (1)   Area or Dimensional Variance.  Where an applicant is seeking an
area or dimensional variance, the following factors shall be considered and
weighed by the BZA to determine if a practical difficulty exists that would
justify approval of the variance. However, no single factor listed below may
control, and not all factors may be applicable in each case. Each case shall be
determined on its own facts.
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity;
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot; or proximity to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
         F.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner, not including purchase or acquisition of the property;
         G.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         H.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
         I.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and
         J.   Whether a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Code.
      (2)   Use Variance.  In order to grant a use variance, the BZA shall
determine that strict compliance with the terms of this code will result in
unnecessary hardship to the applicant. The applicant must demonstrate such
hardship by clear and convincing evidence that all of the following criteria
are satisfied:
         A.   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under
any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is
located;
         B.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         C.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant
(actions of the applicant shall not include the purchase or acquisition of the
property);
         D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
         E.   If there is an existing building on the lot, that such building,
due to its design, cannot be reasonably reused for a permitted use in the
district;
         F.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
         G.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of this code; and
         H.   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant.
   (d)   Time Limit.
      (1)   The applicant shall receive approval of a zoning certificate or
sign permit, as applicable,  within one year of the date the variance was
approved and comply with the time limits of the approved zoning certificate or
sign permit or the approval shall expire unless an alternative schedule was
approved by the BZA in its approval.
      (2)   Upon expiration of a variance approval, a new application,
including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new variance will be
reviewed.
   (e)   Appeals.  Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the BZA shall have the right to appeal the decision the
court of common pleas as provided in ORC Chapters 2505 and 2506.
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18; Ord. 2019-17.  Passed 10-7-19.)
   1105.12  ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   (a)   Purpose .  A zoning certificate shall be required in accordance with
the provisions of this section in order to ensure that proposed development and
uses comply with the standards of this code, and to otherwise protect the
public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of
Wooster.
   (b)   Terminology.  For the purposes of this code, the zoning certificate
review shall be an administrative review that may be applied to permits or
certificates of other names (e.g., sign permits, temporary use permits, etc.)
if so stated in this code. In such cases, the procedure of Section
1105.12(d), below, shall still apply, including the applicability of
administrative waiver requests.
   (c)   Applicability.
      (1)   No building or other structure shall be erected, moved,
structurally altered, or added to, in whole or in part, nor shall any building,
structure, or land be used or changed in use without a zoning certificate
issued by the Zoning Administrator. A change in tenancy or ownership of a
residential dwelling unit shall be exempt from the zoning certificate
requirement unless such change in tenancy changes the classification of the
use.
      (2)   A zoning certificate may be required for the establishment of
certain temporary or accessory use as established in Chapter
1113: Accessory and Temporary Use Regulations.
      (3)   A zoning certificate shall be required for any changes to any site
element, vehicular use area, patio, or other improvements to land as may be

in this code.
      (4)   The establishment of a use of vacant land shall require the
issuance of a zoning certificate.
      (5)   Unless otherwise specifically exempted in Chapter
1127: Signage, signs shall require a zoning certificate.
      (6)   Zoning certificates shall be issued only in conformity with the
provisions of this code unless the application is subject to an approval by the
BZA or Planning Commission providing for additional standards, conditions, or
modifications, in which case, the zoning certificate shall be issued in
conformity with the provisions of those approvals, as applicable.
      (7)   Failure to obtain a zoning certificate shall be a violation of this
code subject to the provisions of Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties.
      (8)   After completion of work allowed under an approved zoning
certificate, the applicant shall also be required to obtain a certificate of
zoning compliance demonstrating that all work was completed under the provision
of the approvals and this code.
   (d)   Zoning Certificate Review Procedure.  The review procedure for a
zoning certificate shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.  The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1105.02, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Zoning Administrator Review and Decision on a Zoning

         A.   The Zoning Administrator may distribute the application to other
staff members and other City departments to solicit comment on the zoning
certificate application.
         B.   Within 30 days after the application is determined to be
complete, the Zoning Administrator shall make a decision on the zoning
certificate application. In making its decision, the Zoning Administrator may
approve or deny the application. The Zoning Administrator may also approve with
modifications or supplementary conditions necessary to ensure the proposed
activity will be in full compliance with this code. If the application is for a
sign permit in the C-4 District, requiring a COA approval, this timeline shall
be extended to 75 days to allow for such review.
         C.   Prior to making a decision, the Zoning Administrator shall have
the authority to provide comments to the applicant regarding necessary
revisions to bring the application into full compliance.
         D.   If the Zoning Administrator fails to act within 30 days, or 75
days if applicable, from the date the application is determined to be complete,
or an extended period as may be agreed upon by the Zoning Administrator and
applicant, then the application shall be considered denied.
         E.   Where revisions are necessary for approval, the application shall
not be deemed formally approved until the applicant makes all of the
appropriate changes and submits all necessary revised forms, maps, and
documents to the Zoning Administrator.
         F.   When the Zoning Administrator denies an application, the Zoning
Administrator shall inform the applicant of the reason for the denial,
including the regulation(s) which would be violated by the proposed use or
development.
         G.   Public Improvements Required.  If the installation of public
improvements is required, the following requirements shall apply regardless if
the development is part of a subdivision application or not:
            i.   A zoning certificate shall not be issued until an agreement is
provided to the City to construct the required improvements.
            ii.   The applicant shall be required to provide a financial
guarantee (See Section
1129.04(g).) in the amount of the estimated cost of the required public

Engineer or before occupancy is allowed in any structure, whichever shall occur
first.
            iv.   The approval of the site design plan or the installation of
public improvements as required by this code shall not obligate the City to
accept improvements for maintenance, repair or operation. Acceptance shall be
subject to local or state regulations where applicable, concerning the
acceptance of each type of improvement.
         H.   Upon issuance of a zoning certificate, the applicant may proceed
with the approved work.
      (3)   Step 3 - Zoning Administrator Review and Decision on a Certificate

development approved under a zoning certificate, the applicant shall submit a
request for a certificate of zoning compliance.
         B.   The Zoning Administrator shall confirm that all changes or work
was completed in accordance with the zoning certificate and make a decision to
approve the certificate of zoning compliance or require additional changes to
bring the work into compliance with the approved zoning certificate.
         C.   No building or use may be occupied until a certificate of zoning
compliance has been approved by the Zoning Administrator.
   (e)   Review Criteria for a Zoning Certificate.  In order to approve any
zoning certificate, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the following:
      (1)   The application complies with all applicable provisions of this
code and the applicable zoning district; and
      (2)   The application complies with all approved plans, conditions, or
other development approvals issued pursuant to the rules of this code (e.g.,
variances, administrative waivers, conditional uses, equivalency provision
reviews, Design and Review Board decision on sign permits in the C-4 District,
etc.).
   (f)   Administrative Waiver Requests.
      (1)   Applicability.
         A.   The Zoning Administrator may grant administrative waivers for any
area or dimensional regulation that does not exceed 10 percent of the
applicable minimum or maximum regulation. Area and dimensional regulations
include, but are not limited to, minimum front, side, and rear yard setbacks;
maximum height of structures; maximum sign height; maximum sign area, etc.
         B.   An administrative waiver for a minimum lot area or lot width
requirement is prohibited.

waiver request that exceeds 10 percent or other variations from the code that
do not qualify for administrative waivers.
      (2)   Administrative Waiver Review Procedure and Decision.
         A.   Administrative waivers shall be reviewed as part of the zoning
certificate review procedure.
         B.   In making a decision on the administrative waiver, the Zoning
Administrator shall approve or deny the application.
         C.   In approving an administrative waiver, the Zoning Administrator
may impose conditions on the approval, the proposed use, and the premises to be
developed or used pursuant to such approval as he or she determines are
required to ensure compliance with the standards of this section and the
purpose of this code. Any conditions established by the Zoning Administrator
shall relate directly to the requested administrative waiver.
      (3)   Review Criteria for Administrative Waivers.  Decisions on an
administrative waiver shall be based on consideration of the following
criteria:
         A.   The waiver will allow the proposed development to reflect the
predominant development character of surrounding similar uses and properties
(e.g., similar setbacks, similar sign areas, etc.).
         B.   Special circumstances exist that make the precise compliance with
the subject standards impractical or unreasonable;
         C.   The waiver request is minor in nature;
         D.   The waiver request does not substantially alter characteristics
found in the development character of the surrounding properties; and
         E.   The waiver request does not deviate from the overall purpose of
this code or the intent and objective of the original regulation.
   (g)   Time Limits.
      (1)   The applicant shall obtain an approved building permit, where
required, and have initiated work within six months of the approval of a zoning
certificate or the approval shall be revoked. The initiation of work shall be

application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new
zoning certificate application will be reviewed.
      (8)   The above time limits shall not apply if alternative time limits
that have been approved by the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission,
Design and Review Board, or BZA, in accordance with the applicable review
procedure.
   (h)   Revoking a Zoning Certificate.  A zoning certificate shall be
revocable, if among other things, the actual development activity does not
conform to the terms of the application and certificate granted thereon or the
decision to approve the zoning certificate was based on false or misleading
information provided by the applicant.  In the event of the revocation of a
certificate, an appeal may be taken to the BZA in accordance with Section
1105.13, of this code.
   (i)   Appeals.  Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by

(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1107.02  OFFICIAL ZONING MAP AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   The boundaries of the zoning districts are shown upon the map
designated as the Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map and all of the
notations, references, and other information shown thereon, are established as
a part of this code and have the same force and effect as if the Official
Zoning Map and all the notations, references, and other information shown
thereon were all fully set forth or described herein, the original of which is
properly attested to and is on file with the Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
code.
   (c)   In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed,
or lost, City Council may, by ordinance, adopt a new Official Zoning Map, which
shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may
correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning
Map. 
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1107.03  INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
aforesaid districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules
shall apply:
   (a)   Where the designation of a boundary line on the zoning map coincides
with the location of a street or alley, the centerline of such street or alley
shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
   (b)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets or alleys, but do coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be
construed to be the boundary of such district.
   (c)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets, alleys, or lot lines, the district boundaries shall be determined by
the use of the scale shown on the Official Zoning Map described in Section
1107.02.
   (d)   All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-
way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the
same zoning district as the property immediately abutting upon such streets,
alleys, public ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-way.
   (e)   Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway, or
railroad right-of-way serves as a zoning district boundary, the zoning district
of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be
the same as that of the abutting property up to the centerline.
   (f)   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official
action as provided by law, the zoning district adjoining each side of such
public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and
all areas included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all
regulations of the extended.
   (g)   All uncertainties and disputes concerning the exact location of zoning
district boundaries shall be resolved by the BZA according to the rules and
regulations that it may adopt. 
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1107.04  ANNEXATION.
   (a)   Unless otherwise stated in the conditions of annexation, territory
annexed to or otherwise becoming a part of the City shall be zoned by City
Council upon recommendation of the Planning Commission as per Section 0. The
Planning Commission shall recommend a zoning classification to City Council
prior to the time City Council accepts an annexation.
   (b)   The Clerk of Council shall notify the Planning Commission immediately
upon receiving a certified transcript of the proceedings for an annexation from
the Board of County Commissioners.
   (c)   If City Council does not simultaneously accept an annexation and
designate a zoning district, the territory annexed shall become an R-1 Suburban
Single-Family Residential District until otherwise classified. 
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1107.05  DISTRICT-SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENTS AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   General Requirements.  The following subsection establishes the
purpose statement for each of the base zoning districts as well as any district
specific requirements.
      (1)   The purpose statement and district-specific standards for Planned
Development (PD) Districts are located in Chapter
1111: Planned Developments.
      (2)   In addition to all standards established within this chapter,
development within the zoning districts shall also be subject to any other
applicable standards of this code including, but not limited to, site
development standards, architectural standards, open space requirements,
landscaping, parking, signs, etc.
   (b)   Single-Family Residential Zoning Districts (R-1, R-2, and R-T).  The
single-family residential zoning districts are established in order to achieve,
among other things, the following purposes:
      (1)   To regulate the bulk and location of dwellings, accessory buildings
and other structures to obtain proper privacy and useable open spaces on each
lot appropriate for the various districts;
      (2)   To regulate the density and distribution of population to avoid
congestion and the overburdening of existing and proposed community facilities
and public services;
      (3)   To foster a variety of residential living unit types while
protecting the character of the City;
      (4)   To provide for proper location of dwellings in relationship to
multi-family, commercial and industrial uses so as to increase the general
convenience, safety and amenities within the community and to protect residents
from nuisances;
      (5)   To provide for limited small-scale community facilities when such
uses are designed and located to be compatible with the residential
neighborhood;
      (6)   To provide proper spacing between buildings to ensure adequate
access for fire and other emergency vehicles and equipment;
      (7)   To protect the desirable characteristics and promote the stability
of existing residential development;
      (8)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land in
accordance with the objectives of the City of Wooster's Comprehensive Plan; and
      (9)   To carry out the following specific district purposes:
         A.   The R-1 Suburban Single-Family Residential District is
established to encourage the creation and preservation of low-density single-
family residential neighborhoods and to limit the establishment of
nonresidential uses to those that are compatible with the intended low-density
neighborhood character. The stipulated density is intended to provide for areas
of suburban character in the community. Suburban areas are typically located at
the outer periphery of the city and are characterized by curvilinear streets,
cul-de-sacs, and attached garages.
         B.   The R-2 Single-Family Residential District is established to
promote, preserve and protect medium-low density predominantly single-family
neighborhoods in the City. Two-family dwellings are restricted to locations
where they are designed and located in a manner that is compatible with the
existing or proposed residential neighborhood.
         C.   The R-T Traditional Residential District is established to
preserve and protect neighborhoods with traditional urban character.
Traditional residential areas are the oldest, close-to-downtown residential
areas in the City. Small, dense lots were generally developed before 1940 in a
regular grid street pattern, with houses constructed with detached garages. As
set forth in the Wooster Comprehensive Plan, traditional residential
development will encourage historic preservation and construction/
reconstruction that is similar in nature to the established pattern and
character of development with a focus on single-family development and
conversions of multi-family dwellings back to the original single-family uses.
   (c)   Multi-Family Residential Zoning Districts (R-3 and R-4).  The multi-
family residential zoning districts regulations are established in order to
achieve, among other things, the following purposes:
      (1)   To regulate the bulk and location of dwellings to obtain proper
privacy and useable open spaces appropriate for the various districts;
      (2)   To regulate the density and distribution of population to avoid
congestion and the overburdening of existing and proposed community facilities
and public services;
      (3)   To preserve the character of differing neighborhoods by providing
different districts with different densities and development standards;
      (4)   To enable the development of attached single-family and multi-
family dwellings in appropriate locations and with a minimum project size to
ensure the creation of sustainable higher density neighborhoods;
      (5)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land in
accordance with the objectives of the City of Wooster's Comprehensive Plan; and
      (6)   To carry out the following specific purposes:
         A.   The R-3 Attached Residential District is established to provide,
preserve and protect medium density residential areas for small-scale attached
dwellings arranged to provide good building site design and effective open
space in areas adequately served by City sewer, water and streets.
         B.   The R-4 Multi-Family Residential District is established to
provide, preserve and protect locations for high density apartment development
in areas with appropriate levels of service. 
   (d)   Manufactured Home Park District (R-5).
      (1)   Purpose.  The Manufactured Home Park District and its regulations
are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
         A.   To provide for orderly growth and development in the City of
Wooster;
         B.   To preserve the character of differing neighborhoods by providing
for the location of mobile homes and manufactured homes in manufactured home
communities;
         C.   To regulate the bulk and location of dwellings to maintain
privacy, safety and open spaces for each unit appropriate for the district; and
         D.   To provide certainty to property owners, developers and neighbors
about the limits of what is allowed in a manufactured home park zoning
district.
      (2)   Discontinued District.  The R-5 District is a discontinued district
and is maintained in this code to minimize the creation of nonconformities.
Applications for amendments to the zoning map to create additional R-
5 Districts shall be prohibited after the effective date of this code, or
amendment thereto. 
      (3)   R-5 District Standards.  While new R-5 Districts may not be
established after the effective date of this code, existing manufactured home
parks may continue without being subject to the nonconformity standards of
Chapter
1131: Nonconformities provided the existing uses comply with the following
standards:
         A.   All manufactured homes, mobile homes, or accessory buildings
shall be set back a minimum of 50 feet from any lot or right-of-way line
bounding the manufactured home community.  See Section
1115.01 for permitted obstructions within required setbacks.
         B.   The existing number of lots within any manufactured home park may
be maintained unless a reduction is required by Wayne County or State of Ohio
officials for the purposes of health and safety.
         C.   Existing manufactured homes or mobile homes may be replaced with
new homes provided such homes comply with any applicable standard of this
section. Such replacement shall require a zoning certificate approval.
         D.   Streets may be maintained but new streets or drives, other than
driveways accessing individual lots, may not be created within a manufactured
home park.
         E.   Existing permitted commercial, office, and recreational accessory
uses may be maintained provided the uses and buildings are designed and located
to protect the character of the district and surrounding residential uses. Such
facilities shall be screened and landscaped so as to be compatible with
adjoining manufactured home lots. 
         F.   A minimum of 15 percent of the total number of required parking
spaces for any manufactured home park shall be maintained for guest parking.
         G.   All existing open spaces and recreational areas shall be
maintained for such uses as long as the manufactured home park continues to
operate.
         H.   All individual home lots/pads shall continue to maintain a
minimum area of 3,600 square feet and a minimum width of 35 feet. Such width
shall be increased to 50 feet for any individual home lots that are classified
as corner lots.
         I.   There shall be a minimum clearance of 20 feet between individual
manufactured or mobile homes.
         J.   All principal buildings shall have a maximum height of 35 feet.
Any accessory structure shall be subject to the standards of Section
1113.01.
         K.   All manufactured and mobile homes shall meet or exceed federal
and state manufactured and mobile home codes, including OAC Ch-3701-27
inclusive, Ohio Sanitary Code, and any amendments or changes thereof.
         L.   All mobile homes within the park shall be served by the City
water supply system and City sanitary sewer system. These utilities shall
conform to all City, County, and State Health Department requirements.
         M.   Each manufactured or mobile home shall be securely skirted,
entirely enclosing the bottom section at the time of occupancy. The skirting
shall be of an impervious material and consistent with the characteristics of
the manufactured home.
         N.   The outer boundaries of the manufactured home park shall contain
a buffer zone planted and maintained by the park operator. The buffer zone
shall be composed of a green strip, not less than 10 feet in width, planted and
maintained with a continuous, evergreen hedge of densely planted evergreen
trees and shrubs not less than six feet in height, located along all park
boundaries, including the boundaries abutting a public right-of-way. This
densely planted buffer zone shall completely obscure the manufactured home
parking community within two years of its planting. 
         O.   All uses and operations, except off-street parking, shall be
performed wholly within enclosed buildings, unless specifically permitted
otherwise.
   (e)   Commercial Zoning Districts (C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4).  The commercial
zoning district regulations are established in order to achieve, among other
things, the following purposes:
      (1)   To provide in appropriate and convenient locations of sufficient
size for the exchange of goods and services;
      (2)   To protect residential neighborhoods adjacent to business uses by
regulating the types of establishments, particularly at the common boundaries,
that would create congestion, noise or other objectionable influences;
      (3)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land in
accordance with the objectives of the City of Wooster's Comprehensive Plan; and
      (4)   To carry out the following specific purposes:
         A.   The C-1 Office/Institutional District is established to create an
environment conducive to well-located and designed office building sites and to
accommodate primarily office uses. This district may also provide a land use
buffer zone to some residential districts, thus providing protection from more
intense business uses or major thoroughfares.
         B.   The C-2 Community Commercial District is established to create a
district that permits a wide variety of retail and service establishments with
development standards that ensure that development is compatible with adjacent
land uses that create a more pedestrian-oriented environment.
         C.   The C-3 General Commercial District is established to accommodate
a broad range of commercial services and activities in locations adequately
served by major streets and other facilities and to provide a wide range of
goods and services to a large consumer population from the larger regional
area.
         D.   The C-4 Central Business District is established to provide a
central business district that preserves, maintains and promotes Downtown
Wooster as a core area for retail sales and to promote and enhance the existing
historic, compact pedestrian orientation of the downtown by permitting
buildings to be close to the street and to one another.
   (f)   Industrial Zoning Districts (I-1, I-2, and I-3).  The industrial
zoning districts are established in order to achieve, among other things, the
following purposes:
      (1)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land and
structures in accordance with the objectives of the City of Wooster
Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   To provide appropriate and convenient districts of sufficient size
to carry on research, manufacturing processes, and distribution activities to
serve the community, thereby promoting employment and strengthening the economy
of the community;
      (3)   To improve the manufacturing environment by discouraging unrelated
and incompatible uses in such areas, thereby making land more readily available
for industry;
      (4)   To protect adjacent residential districts by restricting types of
manufacturing uses nearby to only those which will not create objectionable
influences beyond their district boundaries and will be properly buffered and
screened;
      (5)   To protect manufacturing and related development against congestion
by requiring setbacks and limiting the bulk and density of development in
relation to adjacent buildings and available land and by requiring sufficient
off-street parking and loading facilities; and
      (6)   To carry out the following specific purposes:
         A.   The I-1 Office/Limited Industrial District is established to
provide for office and industrial uses in areas suitable for such development
by reason of location, topography, soil conditions and the availability of
adequate utilities and transportation systems. The intent is to permit office
and other uses such as limited light industrial and warehouse activities that
are office-like in physical appearance, service requirements, and operational
characteristics; uses that can be carried on wholly within enclosed buildings
and subject to those regulations necessary to reduce congestion and for the
protection of adjacent residential and business activities. This district also
permits accessory retail and service uses to serve as support services for the
adjacent office/industrial uses.  The uses allowed are those that because of
their normally unobjectionable characteristics can be operated in relatively
close proximity to residential districts.
         B.   The purpose of the I-2 General Industrial District is to provide
for industrial and other uses that by virtue of their external effects, noise,
glare, fumes, smoke, dust, odors, truck and/or rail traffic, should be isolated
from residential and commercial uses. These uses perform essential functions
for the City, including employment, and should be provided for in areas that
are best suited for industrial development by reason of location, utilities and
transportation systems.
         C.   The purpose of the I-3 Urban Industrial District is to provide
for the continuation and reasonable expansion of existing industries located in
proximity to downtown, and to enable the establishment of new industries within
the existing industrial area which can locate in the area in compliance with
performance and development standards, in ways that are compatible with the
existing urban nature of the downtown area.
   (g)   Agricultural District (AG).  The purpose of this district is to
protect active farmland from development, to provide areas for recreation and
conservation purposes, to furnish areas for public and semi-public uses, to
protect watersheds, to guide growth and development of the community, and to
hold land from development of more intensive land uses until such time as
adequate public facilities and services can be provided. 
   (h)   Community Facilities District (CF).
      (1)   Purpose.  The Community Facilities District (CF) and its
regulations are established in order to accommodate governmental, civic,
educational, recreational facilities and other institutional facilities and
their associated uses in a manner that:
         A.   Provides for the proper location and development of community
facilities;
         B.   Ensures that such community facilities are compatible with
surrounding single-family neighborhoods by requiring development plan review
and conditional use approval, as necessary, for proposed development;
         C.   Provides for the appropriate location of governmental, civic,
educational, recreational, and other institutional uses throughout the city
which may be utilized to provide a transition between zoning districts; and
         D.   Ensures that institutional uses comply with these objectives by
establishing review requirements to ensure that all phases of a development are
consistent with the regulations of this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (2)   CF District Standards.  The following development and design
guidelines are established to ensure that all proposed development in a CF
District complies with the purpose and objectives of this code.  The Planning
Commission shall review plans for a proposed development with consideration
given to the following:
         A.   Buildings, structures and landscaping should be designed and
located on the site and be of a scale and massing to:
            i.   Enhance and protect the character of the surrounding area,
especially adjoining residential areas; and
            ii.   Minimize any adverse influences.
         B.   Adequate screening, buffering, and landscaping shall be provided
to limit the view of the proposed use, reduce the noise between incompatible
land uses, and ease the transition from one zoning district to another.
         C.   Natural features, especially mature trees, shall be preserved and
supplemented with landscaping to buffer and screen adjacent residential
districts. The Planning Commission shall consider the setbacks, building mass
and type when determining the extent of landscaping required.
         D.   When the proposed use abuts or is across the street from a
residential zoning district boundary, a buffer yard shall be required in
accordance with Chapter
1123: Landscaping and Buffering.
         E.   Delivery areas and loading zones shall not face a public street
and shall comply with the screening requirements found in Section
1123.07.
         F.   All power plants, storage or maintenance buildings, which are
visible from a public street, shall have a buffer yard of 20 feet. This buffer
yard shall contain one major tree for every 30 lineal feet of frontage or as
appropriate to provide a tree canopy over the landscaped area. In addition,
four-foot-high shrubs are required per 30 lineal feet of frontage. Ground cover
plants must fully cover the remainder of the landscaped area.
         G.   To provide connectivity, sidewalks shall be provided from
facilities, which are meant for use by the general public like parks and
playgrounds, to the sidewalks in the public rights-of-way.
         H.   All outdoor lighting shall be subject to the requirements of
Section
1117.03.
         I.   Overnight parking and/or the outdoor storage of commercial motor
vehicles, fleet vehicles, commercial motor vehicles, or buses shall be
prohibited.
         J.   Design of Vehicular Use Areas
            i.   Ambulance and emergency areas shall not abut a single-family
residential district. If an ambulance or emergency area is visible from a
public street, it shall have a buffer yard of 20 feet. This buffer yard shall
include screening per the requirements found in Chapter
1123: Landscaping and Buffering.
            ii.   The layout of parking areas, service areas, entrances, exits,
signs, lighting, noise sources or other potentially adverse influences shall be
designed and located to protect the character of residential areas adjacent to
the development.
            iii.   Access from public streets to parking areas, service areas,
and pedestrian walkways within the development shall be designed to minimize
traffic hazards or congestion.
            iv.   Pedestrian connections from the community facilities
development to adjacent parcels should minimize adverse intrusions into
residential neighborhoods.
   (i)   Planned Development District (PD).  The purpose, procedures, and
regulations for planned developments is located in Chapter
1111: Planned Developments.

CHAPTER 1109
Principal Use Regulations
1109.01   Purpose and general provisions.
1109.02   Explanations of the Table of Permitted Uses.
1109.03   Use-specific standards.
   1109.01  PURPOSE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish the list of principal uses
permitted within each of the established zoning districts as well as identify
any use-specific standards that apply to the principal uses separate from any
standard that applies to development within the applicable zoning district. 
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1109.02  EXPLANATION OF THE TABLE OF PERMITTED USES.
   This section provides an explanation of all the symbols and information
contained within Table
1109-1, which identifies where and how uses are principally permitted within
the City of Wooster, Ohio.
   (a)   Permitted Uses.
      (1)   A "P" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed by-right in
the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other
applicable standards of this code.
      (2)   Permitted uses are approved administratively by the Zoning
Administrator through the zoning certificate procedure unless subject to a
development plan review (See Section
1105.07.) or additional reviews (e.g., certificate of appropriateness,
variance, etc.).
      (3)   Any use-specific standards established for the applicable use in
the last column of Table
1109-1 shall not apply to "P" permitted uses.
   (b)   Permitted Uses with Standards.
      (1)   A "PS" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed by-right in
the respective zoning district if it meets the additional standards as
identified in the last column of Table
1109-1. Permitted uses with standards are subject to all other standards of
this code.
      (2)   Uses permitted with standards are approved administratively by the
Zoning Administrator through the zoning certificate procedure unless subject to
a development plan review (See Section
1105.07.) or additional reviews (e.g., certificate of appropriateness,
variance, etc.).
   (c)   Conditional Uses.
      (1)   A "C" in a cell indicates that a use may be permitted if approved
by the Planning Commission through the conditional use review procedure (See
Section
1105.04). Conditional uses may be subject to use-specific standards as
identified in the last column of Table
1109-1. Conditional uses are subject to all other applicable standards of this
code.
      (2)   The existence or lack of additional use-specific standards in this
code shall not be implied to be the only standards the use is required to meet.
Any conditional use listed in the table shall be subject to the general review
standards for all conditional uses established in Section
1105.04(e).
   (d)   Prohibited Uses.
      (1)   A "X" in a cell or a blank cell indicates that a use is prohibited
in the respective zoning district.
      (2)   Any use not specifically listed as permitted, permitted with
standards, or permitted as a conditional use shall be a prohibited use in these
zoning districts and shall only be permitted upon amendment of this code and/or
the zoning map as provided in Section 0, or upon a finding by the Zoning
Administrator that a use is substantially similar to a specified permitted,
permitted with standards, or permitted as a conditional use, as provided for in
Section
1109.02(f), below. 
   (e)   Use-Specific Standards.  The numbers contained in the "Use-Specific
Standards" column are references to additional standards and requirements that
apply to the use type listed. Standards referenced in the "Use-Specific
Standards" column apply in all zoning districts for uses that are permitted
with standards or require a conditional use approval, unless otherwise
expressly stated.
   (f)   Use Determination and Unlisted Uses.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall make the determination if a proposed
use is permitted, permitted with standards, a conditional use, or a prohibited
use under the provisions of this chapter. In making the decision, the Zoning
Administrator may consider the scale and operational activities of the proposed
use or activity to determine its classification. For example, a small-scale
retail oriented dry cleaning or laundry service may be classified as a "service
commercial use", whereas, a large-scale or wholesale dry-cleaning or laundry
operation, with no direct public service, may be classified as "manufacturing
and production (indoors)."
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may determine that a proposed use is
substantially similar to a use that is permitted, permitted with standards, a
conditional use, or a prohibited use established in Table
1109-1 based on the proposed use activities, character of the business,
similarity to existing uses within the City, or information on the use as may
be available from third-party land use resources such as documentation from the
American Planning Association, Urban Land Institute, or similar organizations.
If the Zoning Administrator finds that the proposed use is substantially
similar to a use established in Table
1109-1, the application shall be processed in the same manner as the similar
use.
      (3)   In finding that a proposed use is similar to a use established in
Table
1109-1, the Zoning Administrator shall make a note of the similar use in the
approved application form.
      (4)   If the Zoning Administrator makes the determination that a use is
prohibited, the application shall be processed and considered denied.
      (5)   If the applicant disagrees with the Zoning Administrator's
determination regarding the proposed use, the applicant may choose to take one
of the following actions:
         A.   The applicant may appeal the determination of the Zoning
Administrator to the BZA pursuant to Section
1105.13: Appeals; or
         B.   The applicant may present their case to the Planning Commission
and/or City Council to request that the City initiate a text amendment to
address the proposed use and any applicable standards.

NOTE:
[1]  In the CF District, if the proposed site of a use is a minimum of 300 feet
from any adjacent residentially zoned lot, a conditionally permitted use shall
become a permitted use (P), or where use-specific standards exist, the use
shall become permitted with standards (PS).
 
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1109.03  USE-SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose and Applicability.
      (1)   This section provides site planning, development, and/or operating
standards for certain land uses that are permitted with standards or
conditionally permitted in Table
1109-1.
      (2)   The land uses and activities covered by this section shall comply
with the applicable standards for the specific use in all districts unless
otherwise specified, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this
code including, but not limited to, parking, signs, landscaping, open space,
etc.
      (3)   Where site development standards for a specific use are not listed,
such use shall comply with the site development standards for the applicable
zoning district. See Chapter
1115: Site Development Standards.
   (b)   Agricultural Uses.
      (1)   Agriculture (Livestock).
         A.   The minimum lot area for the use shall be five acres.
         B.   All structures designed to house livestock, either permanently or
temporarily, shall be set back a minimum of 200 feet from all lot lines. All
other structures related to the agricultural use of the property shall be set
back a minimum of 50 feet from all lot lines with the exception of fences or
walls.
      (2)   Community Gardens.  Community gardens are subject to the following
standards:
         A.   Community gardens are permitted in any yard.
         B.   The owner of the property shall have an established set of
operating rules addressing the governance structure of the garden; hours of
operation; maintenance and security requirements and responsibilities; and
distribution of garden plots.
         C.   The name and telephone number of the owner and any person
designated as the person in-charge of the garden coordination along with a copy
of the operating rules shall be kept on file with the Zoning Administrator.
         D.   The site shall be designed and maintained so that water and
fertilizer will not drain onto adjacent properties.
         E.   There shall be no retail sales on site, except for produce grown
on the site.
   F.   Benches, bike racks, raised/accessible planting beds, picnic tables,
garden art, and rain barrel systems are permitted.
         G.   The community garden may include one storage shed and one farm
market per lot (not per individual garden plot) for the purposes of communal
storage and/or communal sales of produce that is grown on-site.
         H.   Fences and walls shall be subject to the provisions of Section
1113.01.
   (c)   Residential Uses.
      (1)   Cluster Residential Developments.
         A.   Purpose.  Cluster Residential Developments (CRD) are intended to
encourage and accommodate creative and imaginative CRDs that provide
alternative housing types and the preservation of open space in a unified
project. In compliance with the following regulations, it is intended that CRDs
will utilize innovations in the technology of land development that are in the
best interests of the City. These regulations are designed to achieve, among
others, the following objectives:
            i.   To promote economical and efficient use of land and reduce
infrastructure costs through unified development;
            ii.   To permit the flexible spacing of lots and buildings in order
to encourage the separation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation; the
provision of readily accessible open space and recreation areas; and the
creation of functional and interesting residential areas;
            iii.   To minimize the impact of new development by reducing curb
cuts onto major thoroughfares and collector streets;
            iv.   To ensure that CRDs are compatible with surrounding single-
family neighborhoods and comply with these objectives by requiring the
submission of development plans and establishing a review process to ensure
that all developments are consistent with these regulations; and
            v.   To be designed and developed to provide alternative housing
types and the preservation of open space through the flexible arrangement of
buildings in a unified development.
         B.   Development Review.
            i.   Approval of a CRD shall be required, subject to the
development plan review procedure of Chapter
1105: Review Procedures.
            ii.   In addition to the general review procedures and review
criteria for development plans in Section
1105.07, the Planning Commission shall review a proposed CRD to ensure that:
               a.   The proposed buildings and uses are located so as to reduce
any substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the character
of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, utility facilities, and other
matters affecting the public health, safety and general welfare;
               b.   Significant buffer zones with adequate landscaping are
provided between the proposed development and adjacent residential areas;
               c.   The bulk and height of buildings within the proposed
development are compatible with the surrounding development;
               d.   Roadway systems, service areas, parking areas, entrances,
exits, and pedestrian walkways within the development are designed to have
access to public streets in a manner that minimizes traffic hazards, or
congestion;
               e.   The layout of parking areas, service areas, entrances,
exits, signs, lighting, noise sources or other potentially adverse influences
are designed and located to protect the residential character of areas adjacent
to the development and to minimize alteration of the natural site features to
be preserved, such as, but not limited to, ravines, stream beds, lakes,
significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size, and rock
outcroppings;
               f.   The proposed development will be constructed, arranged and
operated so as not to interfere with the development and use of neighboring
property, in accordance with the applicable district regulations;
               g.   Irreplaceable, significant natural features located in the
project area, such as but not limited to ravines, stream beds, lakes,
significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size and rock
outcroppings shall be protected;
               h.   That common open space intended for a recreation or public
use will be easily accessible to pedestrians, which accessibility shall meet
the needs of persons with disabilities and the elderly; and
               i.   The proposed cluster development will be served adequately
by spaces, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal,
water and sewers; or that the persons or agencies responsible for the
establishment of the proposed use will provide adequately for such services.
            iii.   Once a development plan review for a CRD has been approved,
the applicant may proceed with the subdivision process.
         C.   Minimum Project Area.  The area proposed to be developed as a CRD
shall be in one ownership, or if in several ownerships, the application shall
be filed jointly by all owners of the properties included in the proposed CRD
boundaries. The minimum gross area of a tract of land in a CRD shall be 15
acres in an R-1 District and 10 acres in an R-2 District.
         D.   Dwelling Types.
            i.   Both single-family detached dwellings on individual lots and
cluster single-family detached dwellings are permitted in a CRD. Upon approval
of a CRD, the applicant or builder may submit applications for zoning
certificates for each individual dwelling.
            ii.   Single-family attached dwellings may be permitted in a CRD
with a conditional use approval (See Section
1105.04.) and provided that there shall be a maximum of three dwelling units
attached in any single structure.
         E.   Density Regulations.
            i.   The gross density of a CRD shall not exceed:
               a.   5.0 dwelling units per acre in an R-1 District; and
               b.   6.0 dwelling units per acre in an R-2 District.
            ii.   The maximum number of dwelling units allowed for a particular
site shall be calculated by multiplying the maximum gross density allowed by
Subsection
1109.03(c)(1)E.i above, by the total project area minus:
               a.   Any public right-of-way within the project boundary
existing at the time the development plan is submitted; and
               b.   The area of land that is within a floodway, designated
wetland or existing water body that exceeds the minimum acreage required for

access to an existing public street right-of-way.
            vi.   Lot Requirements
               a.   Dwelling units are not required to be on individual lots.
However, when lots for standard detached single-family dwelling units or
sublots for single-family cluster or attached dwelling units are included as
part of a CRD, such lots or sublots shall be of sufficient size and shape to
accommodate dwelling units in compliance with the spacing requirements of this
Section.
               b.   The applicant shall depict on the development plan the
maximum parameters, or building envelopes, to indicate where buildings shall be
located, and shall demonstrate that such building location will be in
compliance with the spacing requirements of this Section.

uses will be located adjacent to single-family detached dwellings, a buffer
area with a minimum width of 20 feet shall be located  within the required
setbacks from the project boundary specified in Table
1109-2 and shall be landscaped in accordance with Chapter
1123: Landscaping and Buffering.
         H.   Street Design and General Circulation.
            i.   A street shall be required to be a public, dedicated street
when such street:
               a.   Provides access to detached single-family dwellings on
subdivided lots;
               b.   Is a major street that connects two existing public streets
and which is intended to provide a future continuing street system beyond the
project boundaries, or is expected to accommodate pass-through traffic going to
and from adjacent developments; or
               c.   Otherwise required by this code to be a public street.
            ii.   Streets that are not otherwise required to be public streets
pursuant to Subsection
1109.03(c)(1)H.i, above, may be approved as private streets. The Planning
Commission may approve private streets when all of the following requirements
are met:
               a.   A private street shall not be planned or be expected to
extend to serve property outside the CRD and shall be subject to Section
1129.07;
               b.   Right-of-ways shall not be required for private streets;
however, utility easement(s) may be required along the length of the private
street; and
               c.   The design and layout of the private street(s) shall
provide adequate and safe access to the intended units, as determined by the

a CRD shall be constructed in accordance with the standards set forth for
public streets in Chapter
1125: Parking, Access, and Mobility and Chapter
1129: Subdivision Design. However, when the Planning Commission determines that
certain elements of a public street do not or should not specifically apply to
a private street due to the circumstances of a particular project or portion of
a project, the Planning Commission may waive or permit a modification to the
installation of any such element(s) to the extent deemed just and proper
provided such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good and is
consistent with the purpose of this chapter and the CRD. This provision also
applies to waiving the requirement for curbs and storm sewers when the
applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and the
Planning Commission that, based on the topography of the site, open space,
density and other environmental considerations, the proposed open natural
drainage system will equally satisfy the drainage requirements.
            iv.   If a common drive is proposed instead of a public or private
street, such common drive shall comply with Section
1129.07(f)(5).
            v.   A pedestrian circulation system shall be included in the CRD.
The system shall provide convenient pedestrian access throughout the CRD and
from the CRD to other areas of the community.  Walkways shall be constructed of
concrete or asphalt unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission.
         I.   Supplemental Requirements.  Additional development requirements
formulated to achieve the objectives of this Chapter may be established at the
time the CRD development plan is reviewed. Any such development requirements
adopted with such plan shall become binding land use requirements for the
proposed CRD. 
         J.   Homeowners Associations.  As part of a CRD, a homeowners'
association, community association, condominium association or similar legal
entity shall be created in compliance with Section
1121.06 so that such association is responsible for the maintenance and control
of common areas, including the required open space, open space easements,
private streets and common drives.
         K.   Phased Development.  If development is to be implemented in
phases, each phase shall have adequate provision for access, parking, storm
water management, and other public improvements to serve the development in
accordance with the applicable criteria set forth above. Each phase shall be
provided with temporary or permanent transitional features, buffers, or
protective areas in order to prevent any adverse impact on completed phases,
future phases, and adjoining property.

            iii.   The public street elevation of each residential unit shall
have at least one street-oriented entrance and contain the principal windows of
the unit.
            iv.   All parking spaces shall be located behind the front building
line. An exception to this requirement may be granted, where necessary due to
special characteristics of the site such as lot depth, or due to the location
of existing mature trees, such location is impracticable. Shared driveways are
permitted, with the recordation of perpetual easements to provide for the use
and maintenance of the shared driveway.
      (5)   Dwellings, Two-Family Conversion from a Single-Family Dwelling.  An
existing single-family dwelling may be converted to a two-family dwelling

prevent any hazard and to assure against any disturbance or nuisance to
surrounding properties, residents, or to the community in general.
         C.   Parking for visitors and employees shall be located behind the
front building line. An exception to this requirement may be granted due to the
shallow depth of the parcel, the location of mature trees, or other similar
factors.
         D.   In order to prevent the concentration of such facilities, no
transitional housing shall be located within 1,000 feet of any other
transitional housing or group home. Such distances shall be measured along a
straight line from the corner of the building containing one facility to the
nearest corner of the building containing the second facility.
         E.   Prior to the issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance, the
operator or agency shall provide evidence that a valid license has been issued
or is obtainable for this proposed use on the subject property.  If licensing
is not available, a verified affidavit so stating shall be presented. Failure
to maintain such license, certification or other approval requirements shall
result in immediate revocation of the facility's conditional use approval.
         F.   Findings by the Planning Commission.  In its review of each
proposed facility, the Planning Commission shall make specific findings of fact
relative to the following criteria. The proposed facility:
            i.   Is licensed by the appropriate authority to provide such
service within the State (and the City).  If such licensing is not available, a
certified affidavit so stating has been presented to document this statement;
            ii.   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as
to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the surrounding uses so
that such use will not change the essential character of the same area;
            iii.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or planned
future neighboring uses from the standpoint of noise, lights, congestion or
traffic generation which would be incompatible with the neighborhood
environment;
            iv.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage and
schools; or that the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of
the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately any such services;
            v.   Will not involve uses, activities and conditions of operation
that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or the general welfare; and
            vi.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be
so designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets.     
   (d)   Commercial and Office Uses. 
      (1)   Adult Uses.
         A.   Purpose and Intent.  The City of Wooster has determined that
permitting adult uses, as defined in this code, in proximity to residential,
institutional, and non-adult oriented retail uses would have a detrimental
effect on such adjacent uses.  It has been demonstrated that adult uses, as
defined in this code, have been known to cause undesirable secondary effects on
residential and institutional uses, particularly those where children are
present, as well as adjacent non-adult retail uses.  The provisions of this
section do not have the purpose or effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials.  Further, it is not the intent of this section to restrict
or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market.  Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.  Therefore, in order to prevent potential deterioration in Wooster's
retail areas; and to avoid potential adverse impacts on residential and
institutional uses particularly those where children are present, and thereby
protecting the public health, safety and welfare, adult uses, as defined in
this code, shall be permitted only in the I-2 District subject to the
regulations of this chapter.
         B.   Findings.  The City Council has received substantial evidence
concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community in
findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres,
Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976),
and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other
communities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona;
Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas;
Beaumont, Texas; Houston, Texas; and Seattle, Washington.
         C.   Location of Adult Uses.
            i.   An adult use shall not be operated or located on any parcel
within 1,000 feet of:
               a.   Places of worship;
               b.   Educational institutions (K-12);
               c.   Active recreational uses;
               d.   Passive parks, open space, and natural areas that are open
and accessible to the public;
               e.   Cultural institutions;
               f.   A boundary of any residential zoning district; and
               g.   Another adult use.
            ii.   No such adult use shall be located on any parcel or operated
within 500 feet of any Landmark or Landmark District.
            iii.   No advertisements, displays, or other promotional materials
displaying specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas shall be
shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from pedestrian sidewalks
or walkways, or from other areas public or semi-public.
            iv.   All building openings, entries, windows, etc. for adult uses
shall be located, covered, or serviced in such a manner as to prevent a view
into the interior from any public or semi-public area, sidewalk or street.  For
new construction, the building shall be oriented so as to minimize any
possibility of viewing the interior from public or semi-public areas.
            v.   No screens, loudspeakers or sound equipment shall be used for
adult motion pictures theaters (enclosed or drive-in) that can be seen or
discerned by the public from public or semi-public areas.
            vi.   For the purposes of this section, measurements shall be made
in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from
the nearest portion of the building or structure used as a part of the premises
where an adult use is conducted, to the nearest property line of the premises
of a church or school, or to the nearest boundary of an affected public park,
or residential district.
            vii.   For the purposes of this section, the distance between any
two adult uses shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures or objects from the closest exterior wall of the
structure in which each adult use is located.
            viii.   No person shall establish, operate or cause the
establishment or operation of any adult use in violation of the provisions of
this section.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or limit
the display, sale or rental of descriptive, printed, film or video material or
any live performance which, taken as a whole, contains serious literary,
artistic, political, medical, educational or scientific value.
            ix.   Any adult use lawfully operating on the effective date of
this code that is in violation of this section shall be deemed a nonconforming
use.  An adult use lawfully operating as a conforming use is not rendered a
nonconforming use by the subsequent location of any use or zoning district
identified in Section
1109.03(d)(1)C.i, within 1,000 feet, or a landmark or historic district within
500 feet, of the adult use.  When a nonconforming adult use of a structure or
premises is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than six months, the
structure, building, or premises shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
      (2)   Assembly Halls, Membership Clubs, Conference Centers.
         A.   The proposed use shall not generate excessive noise beyond the
premises. In order to minimize any effects of the above, the Planning
Commission may require additional noise reduction measures to assure that the
level of noise is in compliance with Section
1117.01, and any other applicable noise regulations.
         B.   In order to minimize any effects of the above uses, the Planning
Commission may require additional noise reduction measures to assure that the
level of noise is no more than the prevailing noise levels of permitted uses in
the District. In addition, the Planning Commission may limit the hours/days of
operation to ensure that the use is compatible with surrounding land uses.
      (3)   Automated Teller Machine (Stand-Alone).
         A.   Such facilities shall be located on an arterial or collector
street in an area least disruptive to pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
         B.   Any proposed loudspeaker system shall be approved as part of the
development plan and shall be located as far from residential dwellings as
feasible.
         C.   All access drives shall be located as far as practicable from an
existing intersection in order to minimize congestion and constricted turning
movements.
      (4)   Automotive Fuel Sales and Automotive Service Station and Parts
Sales.
         A.   Gasoline pumps and canopies shall be set back the minimum
distance required for a parking area setback in the applicable zoning district.
Gasoline pumps shall also be set back a minimum of 50 feet from any adjacent
lots used for residential purposes.
         B.   Except while being serviced at a fuel pump island, no vehicle
shall be parked between the fuel pumps and the front property line.
         C.   When an establishment with automotive fuel sales is located on a
corner lot, the following shall apply:
            i.   The lot shall have a minimum of 100 feet of lot frontage on
each of the two intersecting streets;
            ii.   The location of access drives shall be placed as far as
possible from the intersection; and
            iii.   Shall be limited to no more than one access drive or
driveway per street frontage.
         D.   All hydraulic hoists, oil pits, and all lubricants, greasing,
vehicle washing and repair equipment shall be enclosed entirely within a
building. No outdoor disassembly or repair of motor vehicles shall be
permitted.
         E.   Activities shall be limited to:
            i.   The sale of fuel;
            ii.   The servicing of motor vehicles with minor repair work;
            iii.   Automatic or hand washing of vehicles within an enclosed
building;
            iv.   The retail sale of vehicle parts and products relating to
minor repair work such as, but not limited to, oil, grease, antifreeze,
batteries, windshield wipers, etc.
         F.   Any major repair work, including automobile body repair and
painting, work on vehicles over a three-ton weight, automobile glass work,
automobile transmission work, automobile engine overhaul and repair, and
radiator repair work shall be classified as "automotive repair (heavy)" and
shall be subject to Section
1109.03(d)(5). 
         G.   Vehicles being serviced or awaiting same shall be stored for no
longer than 14 days on the site if in unenclosed areas.
         H.   Any removal of pumps or tanks shall be undertaken in accordance
with safe accepted practices as prescribed by the National Fire Protection
Association and filling depressions to the grade level of the lot.
         I.   The storage and disposal of solid waste and recyclable materials,
including used or discarded motor vehicle parts or equipment, and fluids, shall
comply with all applicable federal, State, and local requirements. 
         J.   No junk, inoperative, or unlicensed vehicle will be permitted to
remain outdoors.

denial and reasons are not in the same document, both must be provided to the
applicant at the same time).
         E.   Standards Applicable for Conditional Use Applications.  A
wireless telecommunication facility that is proposed in a location that
requires conditional use approval shall comply with the following:
            i.   A wireless telecommunication facility shall be permitted in a
location set forth in Section
1109.03(f)(10)C, only to the extent that a technically suitable location is not
available in an area identified in Section
1109.03(f)(10)B.  The applicant shall demonstrate that a technically suitable
location in an area identified in Section
1109.03(f)(10)B is not available and:
               a.   The applicant shall provide documentation that supports the
applicant's claim that no such technically suitable location exists; or
               b.   If another tower, building, or structure set forth in
Section
1109.03(f)(10)B, is technically suitable, then the applicant must show that
reasonable efforts have been made to:
                  1.   Request colocation on the existing tower(s), building(s)
or structure(s) and that each colocation request was rejected by the owner of
the tower, building or structure; or
                  2.   Request of all owners of properties determined to be
locations that are technically suitable to permit construction of a wireless
telecommunication tower, within reasonable terms, and demonstrate that each
request was rejected.
            ii.   As a condition of approving the conditional use permit to
construct and operate a wireless telecommunication tower in the City, the
owner/operator of the wireless telecommunication tower shall be required to
allow colocation until said tower has reached full antenna capacity.  In no
event shall the owner/operator agree to allow fewer than two additional antenna
platforms.  Agreement to this provision shall be included in the applicant's
lease with the landowner, if different from the owner/operator of such tower. 
Written documentation shall be presented to the Planning Commission showing
that the owner of the property on which such tower is to be located has agreed
to the terms of this subsection as well as all other applicable requirements,
regulations and standards set forth in this chapter.
            iii.   Any wireless telecommunication tower proposed as a
conditional use shall be located a minimum of one-half mile from any other

requirements.
            ii.   All wireless telecommunication towers should be constructed
with "stealth" design technology.  Examples of stealth technology include
architecturally screened roof mounted antennas, antennas integrated into
architectural elements, the design of the tower to look like a light pole or
power pole, increased setbacks from the right-of-way, integration into natural
vegetation, establishment of a tower height similar to surrounding buildings,
or other methods that will allow the tower to blend in with the surrounding
area.
            iii.   Unless otherwise provided for in this section, a wireless
telecommunication facility shall comply with the setback and yard requirements
applicable to buildings in the underlying zone in which it is located.  A
wireless telecommunication tower shall be placed upon the lot in such a way as
to minimize the visual impact on adjoining roads and properties.  In no event

Zoning Administrator.  The guarantee shall be for the purpose of insuring that
an abandoned, obsolete, or destroyed wireless telecommunication facility shall
be removed in compliance with Section
1109.03(f)(10)G.  Any successor-in-interest or assignee of the applicant shall
be required to additionally execute such bond.
            iii.   Prior to receiving approval for a new tower, the applicant
shall demonstrate to the City that such facility is needed to meet the
reasonable service requirements of the applicant.  This assessment shall
include consideration of alternative sites and the operational implications of
such alternatives with respect to, but not limited to, height, opportunities
for co-location, impact on residents and impact on service levels.  The City
may retain consultants to review the information, with the reasonable costs for
such consultation being borne by the applicant.

   The purpose of the Planned Development (PD) District regulations is to
encourage innovative land planning and design in situations where a better
development and mixture of uses may be accomplished through a uniform planning
and design process that offers more flexibility than may traditionally be found
in the strict application of the subdivision regulations and standards from a
traditional zoning district. Furthermore, it is the intent of these regulations
to:
   (a)   Provide an opportunity for a mix of land uses otherwise not permitted
within the standard municipal zoning district classifications;
   (b)   Allow the creation of development standards that respect the unique
characteristics, natural quality and beauty of the site and the immediate
vicinity and protect the community's natural resources by avoiding development
on, and destruction of, sensitive environmental areas;
   (c)   Enable greater review of design characteristics to ensure that the
development project is properly integrated into its surroundings and is
compatible with adjacent development;
   (d)   Assure compatibility between proposed land uses within and around the
PD District through appropriate development controls;
   (e)   Pursue the housing and economic development goals of the City;
   (f)   Promote economical and efficient use of land and reduce infrastructure
costs through unified development;
   (g)   Provide for supporting community facilities;
   (h)   Establish objective criteria for plan review that ensures conformity
to community standards; and
   (i)   Further the goals and recommendations of the comprehensive plan.
      (Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1111.02  PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PDODS.
   (a)   Planned Development Overlay Districts (PDOD), including development
plans and any associated text and standards, adopted prior to the effective
date of this code amendment creating PD regulations, shall continue in effect
and be considered legally conforming under this code.
   (b)   Any proposed modification of a previously approved PDOD shall be
reviewed in accordance with this chapter.
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1111.03  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   The applicant must own in fee simple or have an option to purchase all
lands within the proposed PD. The exception to this is if the applicant is the
authorized agent for the property owner, in which case, the applicant need not
own the lands.
   (b)   Any transfer of land within the development resulting in a change of
ownership within the development after an application has been filed shall not
alter the applicability of the regulations contained herein provided any new
owners authorize the continuation of the PD process.
   (c)   No zoning certificate or building permits may be issued until the PD
final development plan is approved and a final subdivision plat, if required,
has been recorded in accordance with this code.   
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1111.04  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES.
   The following development standards are established to guide and control the
planning, development and use of land in a PD:
   (a)   Minimum Project Size.  The minimum project size for a PD application
shall be five acres. The Planning Commission may allow an application for
smaller project areas if such land is found to be suitable for a PD by virtue
of its unique historical character, topography, unique use, or other natural
features, or by virtue of its qualifying as an isolated problem area.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      (1)   The PD preliminary development plan approval shall include a list
of uses permitted within the PD based on uses defined in Chapter
1109: Principal Use Regulations. The list of uses shall be of the same name and
definition as established in this code.
      (2)   The PD preliminary development plan shall delineate where such use
or uses are permitted.
      (3)   Where the use has established use-specific standards as set forth
in Chapter
1109: Principal Use Regulations, the Planning Commission and City Council may
require compliance with all of the standards or may waive some or all of the
standards based on the design of the PD and the ability of such design to
mitigate the impacts of the uses.
      (4)   The Planning Commission and City Council shall consider
recommendations of the comprehensive plan in approving certain uses but in all
cases, the maximum density of single-family detached residential uses shall be
eight units per acre and the maximum density of all other residential uses
shall be 16 units per acres.
   (c)   Building and Use Arrangements.
      (1)   The design and development standards set forth in this section are
intended to provide considerable latitude and freedom in order to encourage
variety in the arrangement of uses and of the location, bulk and shape of
buildings, open space and landscape features.
      (2)   Buildings and uses shall be arranged, designed, or located in order
to screen and preserve uses within and nearby the PD from adverse effects of
uses within or nearby the PD.
      (3)   The buildings and uses may be arranged in various groups, courts,
or clusters with open spaces organized and related to the buildings in order to
provide privacy where applicable, to form a unified composition of buildings
and space, and to maximize the peace and tranquility of the residential
occupants of the PD and the nearby area, where applicable.
      (4)   Whenever a proposed PD development includes areas of a higher
intensity than that permitted in adjacent areas, the location and arrangement
of use areas shall include appropriate buffers, open spaces, setbacks, or other
transitional areas to ensure compatibility with the lower intensity areas.
      (5)   Buildings, structures and parking areas shall be designed and
located within the PD in ways that conserve environmentally sensitive or unique
natural, historic, or cultural features, and minimize environmental impacts.
      (6)   The development shall be designed to protect adjoining property
from the excessive loss of light, air, and view because of the proximity or the
bulk or shape of a building or structure within the PD.
      (7)   There shall be easy access to both common open space and private
open spaces for all residential dwelling units. 
      (8)   All buildings shall be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the outer
lot line that forms the perimeter of the project unless the City determines
that the adjacent use is similar in nature to the adjacent use and a reduced
setback may be approved.
   (d)   Topography and Natural Resources.
      (1)   It is a requirement of this code that such developments shall be
designed to take advantage of the topography of the land in order to utilize
the natural contours, to economize on the construction of utilities to reduce
the amount of grading and to maximize the conservation of trees and topsoil.
The natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be
integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the arrangement of
buildings, open spaces and site features.
      (2)   A riparian buffer of 20 feet shall be provided along the entire
length and on both sides of a river or perennial stream channel unless a wider
buffer is required by the City of Wooster Site Development and Improvement
Manual. Walkways may be permitted to be located within riparian buffers when
the Planning Commission determines that such will create minimal change to the
riparian buffer.
      (3)   The 100-year floodplain shall be protected. The Flood Insurance
Study prepared by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Federal Insurance Administration or the latest acceptable study shall be used
to determine the 100-year floodplain.

traffic can be controlled and operated effectively with minimum interference
with the capacity of the major arterial and collector streets. The amount of
traffic generated by commercial uses passing through residential areas shall be
minimized.
      (3)   A pedestrian circulation system shall be included and designed to
provide convenient and safe pedestrian access throughout the PD, and to connect
to neighboring developments and community facilities. The pedestrian
circulation system may include sidewalks and other walkways not located along
streets. Sidewalks shall meet the standards found in Section
1125.09.
      (4)   Trail systems for bikes and other purposes should be included and
designed in accordance with the City's plan for trails in the Comprehensive
Plan or other adopted policy documents. Such trail systems shall have a minimum
width of eight feet and be properly buffered from any adjacent residential
areas if the trail is not located along or within the right-of-way of a public
street.
      (5)   Street Design.
         A.   Street alignments should be designed to conserve natural features
and minimize the need for cut and fill practices.
         B.   The function of adjacent thoroughfares shall be maintained by
limiting access points to the minimum needed, relating them to existing access
points, the street patterns on surrounding development, the thoroughfare plan
and the intensity of proposed uses.
         C.   All streets shall be designed in accordance with Chapter
1129: Subdivision Design.
         D.   The design and locations of streets and parking areas shall
comply with the requirements for storm water management set forth in Chapter

landscape or land uses.
      (2)   Privacy for residential buildings shall be maintained through the
use of landscaping, screening and buffering.
      (3)   Appropriate buffer zones with adequate landscaping shall be
provided between the proposed development and adjacent areas. The City may
utilize the buffering requirements of Chapter
1123: Landscaping and Buffering, as a guide in the minimum amount of buffering
that should be required between various land uses.
      (4)   Alternative design approaches to meet the intent of the landscape
regulations may be incorporated.
      (5)   Detention/retention facilities that are visible from a public
street shall be integrated into a landscaped area. Such landscaped areas shall
contain any combination of the following elements: shade and ornamental trees,
evergreens, shrubbery, hedges, and/or other planting materials as well as
ornamental fencing.
   (h)   Signs.
      (1)   All signs and graphics within the PD shall be compatible in size,
location, height, material, shape, color and illumination.

      (3)   The materials and colors of signs, sign backgrounds, and sign
frames should be compatible with the materials and colors used in the principal
buildings.
      (4)   Signs shall conform to the applicable regulations in Chapter
1127: Signage, regarding any standards specific to the different sign types,
however, the City may authorize additional sign area and increased sign heights
as part of a PD preliminary development plan approval.
   (i)   Required Open Space and Common Facilities.
      (1)   The PD will only be approved if the proposed PD preliminary and
final development plans comply with the open space requirements established in
Chapter
1121: Open Space Standards. Open space is only required for PDs that contain
residential uses.
      (2)   In cases where the PD will be developed in phases, each phase shall
contain enough open space that they can comply with the minimum open space
requirements as a stand-alone phase or, if combined with previously developed
phases, can, as a whole, comply with the minimum open space requirements.
      (3)   All open space and common facilities (e.g., bike trails, community
centers, community pools, etc.) shall be owned and controlled in accordance
with Chapter
1121: Open Space Standards.
   (j)   Project Phasing.  If the PD is to be implemented in phases, each phase
shall have adequate provision for access, parking, storm water management,
utilities, and other public improvements to serve the development in accordance
with the applicable criteria set forth above. Each phase shall be provided with
temporary and/or permanent transitional features, buffers, or protective areas
in order to prevent any adverse impact on completed phases, future phases, and

densities and intensities, yard requirements, and area and frontage
requirements) with the approved PD preliminary development plan;
      (4)   Each individual phase of the development can exist as an
independent unit that is capable of creating an environment of sustained
desirability and stability, or that adequate assurance will be provided that
such objective can be obtained; and

         (Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1111.07  COMPLIANCE AND MODIFICATIONS OF APPROVED PLANS.
   (a)   A PD shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the
approved PD final development plan and all supporting data.  The PD final
development plan and supporting data, together with all recorded amendments,
shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and assignees,
and shall limit and control the use of premises (including the internal use of
buildings and structures) and the location of structures in the planned
development as set forth therein.
   (b)   Where a modification is requested for a single lot after a PD final
development plan is approved, the modification shall be reviewed in accordance
with Section
1105.11 or Section
1105.12(f), as applicable.
   (c)   Any request to change or otherwise modify the approved PD preliminary
or final development plan as it applies to more than one property owner, shall
be reviewed based on whether the change is considered major or minor, in
accordance with this subsection.
      (1)   Major change.
         A.   Major changes to a PD generally require the prior approval of the
Planning Commission and the City Council. The Zoning Administrator shall have
the authority to determine if a proposed change is a major change. Such changes
include, but are not limited to:
            i.   Expansion of the PD project beyond the original tract
coverage;
            ii.   Changes to the list of permitted uses or the areas designated
for certain land uses unless the Zoning Administrator finds that such change is
to a similar use, in which case it may be approved by the Planning Commission;
            iii.   Removal or subtraction of land from the original tract
coverage; and
            iv.   Proposed changes that will result in an increase in
residential density or an aggregate increase of more than 10 percent in
nonresidential square footage.
         B.   Changes that require the approval of only the Planning Commission
include, but are not limited to, the following:
            i.   Changes in the site plan relative to the size and arrangement
of buildings, the layout of streets or circulation patterns, the size,
configuration and location of common open space, and changes in any approved
elements of the PD; and
            ii.   Amendments to the conditions that were attached to the
original PD approval.
      (2)   Minor changes.
         A.   Minor changes are those proposed by the developer/owner that do
not disturb or affect the basic design and approved concept plan of the PD and
which are essentially technical in nature, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator.
         B.   Examples of minor changes include, but are not limited to,
changes in the intensity of lighting, changes in the size and location of water
and sewer lines within approved easements, minor changes to lot lines that do
not adjust the overall density or number of lots, substitution of landscaping
materials, and changes in the location and number of fire hydrants.
         C.   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the Planning Commission of
all such approved minor changes.
            (Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1111.08  VIOLATIONS.
   Any violation of the conditions or standards of this chapter and any
approved PD preliminary or final development plan shall be deemed a violation
of this code, subject to Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties. 
(Ord.  2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
CHAPTER 1113
Accessory and Temporary Use Regulations
1113.01   Accessory uses and structures.
1113.02   Temporary uses and structures.
   1113.01  ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Purpose. This section authorizes the establishment of accessory uses
and structures that are incidental and customarily subordinate to principal
uses.  The intent of this section is to allow a broad range of accessory uses
while not creating adverse impacts on surrounding lands.
   (b)   General Provisions.
      (1)   An accessory use or structure shall be incidental to the primary
use of the lot, and shall not alter the character of the principal use.
      (2)   Accessory uses and structures shall be constructed on the same lot
as the principal use that it serves.
      (3)   No accessory structure shall be constructed on any lot until the
construction of the principal structure has commenced.  In cases where the main
or principal structure is demolished, an existing accessory structure shall be
allowed to remain on the lot or property without the main structure to which it
is supposed to be an accessory on the following conditions:
         A.   Up to 12 months consistent with that allowed by Chapter
1131: Nonconformities.
         B.   A zoning certificate and building permit is obtained for the
reconstruction of the main or principal structure, the construction of which
shall take place within 12 months.  Failure to reconstruct the main or
principal structure will be an automatic cause for the removal of the accessory
structure at the owner's expense.
      (4)   Small accessory structures such as doghouses, benches, garden
decorations, barbeque equipment, etc. shall be exempt from the provisions of
this section provided they do not have a footprint that exceeds 50 square feet.
      (5)   Gardens and the raising of crops for the personal use of the
residents, tenants, or property owners, may be grown in any yard, without a
permit.
      (6)   An accessory structure that is attached to the principal building
shall be considered an integral part of the principal building and shall comply
with the site development standards and all other development standards for the
principal building in the applicable zoning district. Any accessory structure
shall be considered as an integral part of the principal building if it is
connected to the principal building either by common walls or by a breezeway or
roof.
      (7)   The accessory use regulations of this chapter shall not apply to
any public park lands owned by the City, Wayne County, or the State of Ohio.
      (8)   Height Limit.  Unless otherwise stated, the maximum height of a
detached accessory structure shall be 20 feet. In no case shall an accessory
structure exceed the height of the principal building.
      (9)   Number and Size Requirements.
         A.   There shall be no more than two accessory buildings located on a
single lot of record in a single-family residential district (R-1, R-2, and R-
T).
         B.   The maximum total area of all accessory buildings and structures
identified in Subsection
1113.01(b)(9)C below, shall be equal to or less than the square footage
calculated as 30 percent of the rear yard.  Accessory buildings and structures
shall also be subject to building and lot coverage standards in Chapter
1115: Site Development Standards.
         C.   The following accessory structures shall be considered as part of
the maximum lot coverage requirements established in Paragraph
1113.01(b)(9)B, above, and in Chapter
1115: Site Development Standards.
            i.   Detached garages and carports;
            ii.   Detached storage/utility sheds, gazebos, and other similar
structures;
            iii.   Porches and decks
            iv.   Ground-mounted solar energy systems;
            v.   Swimming pools;
            vi.   Tennis and other recreational courts; and
            vii.   Other accessory buildings similar in nature to the above-
mentioned structures, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (10)   Setback and Location Requirements.
         A.   Unless otherwise required in this section, all accessory uses and
structures shall be set back a minimum of three feet from all lot lines.
         B.   Additional setbacks may be required from the principal building,
adjacent structures, or streets based on the applicable building or fire code
regulations.
         C.   No detached accessory structure shall be located less than ten
feet from the principal building. If the separation of the accessory and main
structure is less than ten feet, the accessory structure shall be protected
with a fire-resistant material and shall conform to the same yard requirements
as the principal building.
   (c)   Prohibited Structures for Accessory Uses.  Except as provided in code,
the use of inflatable garages or storage structures, portable carports or
garages that are not permanently anchored into a foundation, temporary
structures as defined in Section
1113.02, portable containers, shipping containers, and semi-tractor trailers
used for storage (with or without wheels) shall not be used as permanent
accessory structures in any zoning district.
   (d)   Permitted Accessory Uses.  The following is an explanation of Table
1113-1.
      (1)   The symbols for permitted uses (P), permitted uses with standards
(PS), and conditional uses (C) are defined in the same manner as Section
1109.02.
      (2)   Prohibited Uses.  A "X" in a cell or a blank cell indicates that a
use is prohibited in the respective zoning district.
      (3)   Yards Permitted.  This column identifies within which yards the use
may be permitted. See the use-specific standards for any restrictions related
to placement in individual yards.
      (4)   Zoning Certificate Required.  A "Yes" in the "Zoning Certificate
Required" column shall mean that the applicable accessory structure requires a
zoning certificate in order to be constructed.
      (5)   Lot Coverage.  A "Yes" in the "Lot Coverage" column shall mean that
the footprint of the applicable accessory structure shall be calculated as part
of the maximum lot coverage standards established in Chapter
1115: Site Development Standards.
      (6)   Use-Specific Standards.  The numbers contained in the "Use-Specific
Standards" column are references to additional standards and requirements that
apply to the use type listed. Standards referenced in the "Use-Specific
Standards" column apply in all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly
stated.
      (7)   Use Determination and Unlisted Uses.
         A.   The Zoning Administrator shall make the determination if a
proposed use is permitted, permitted with standards, a conditional use, or a
prohibited use under the provisions of this section.
         B.   Section
1109.02(f) identifies the procedure the Zoning Administrator will use in
addressing uses that are similar to other uses in Table
1113-1 or uses that are unlisted.
      (8)   Accessory Uses in the Planned Developments.
         A.   The types of accessory uses allowed in a Planned Development (PD)
shall be considered as part of the PD review. Generally:
            i.   Accessory uses for residential dwellings shall be those
allowed in the R-2 District.
            ii.   Accessory uses for commercial uses shall be those allowed in
the C-3 District.
            iii.   Accessory uses for industrial uses shall be those allowed in
the I-2 District.
         B.   The Planning Commission and City Council may approve alternative
accessory uses and structures within a PD if allowed as part of the PD
preliminary development plan approval process.

   (e)   Standards for Specific Accessory Uses and Structures.  The following
requirements apply to the specific types of accessory uses and structures
listed, in addition to the requirements of Section
1113.01(b).
      (1)   Accessibility Ramps.  Ramps that provide access to buildings for
the disabled are permitted in all zoning districts and may encroach in all
setbacks but shall not encroach on a public sidewalk, right-of-way, or street.
      (2)   Amateur Radio Towers and Antenna.
         A.   No more than one amateur radio tower and/or antenna shall be
permitted on each lot.
         B.   Ground-mounted amateur radio towers, antennas, and related guy
wire anchors must be located in the rear yard.
         C.   Building-mounted amateur radio towers and antennas must be
located to the rear of the centerline of the principal building.
         D.   Such tower shall not exceed 65 feet in height or the maximum
height of the applicable zoning district, whichever is greater. The measurement
shall be made from the grade directly beneath the tower to the highest point on
the antenna or tower, whichever is the tallest point of the structure.
         E.   Antennas and guy wire anchors shall not overhang or otherwise be
located within required accessory structure setbacks or on adjacent lots.
         F.   When an amateur radio tower and antenna is no longer being used
by an FCC amateur radio license holder for amateur radio service, the tower and
antenna must be removed no more than 180 days after cessation of the FCC
license or the transfer or property ownership or lease to an individual without
an FCC license.
         G.   Amateur radio towers and antennas that do not comply with the
provisions of this section shall require a conditional use approval (See
Section
1105.04). The application for a conditional use approval for amateur radio
towers and antennas must demonstrate that compliance with the provisions of
this section would prevent the amateur radio operator from exercising the
rights granted to him or her by the FCC or the State of Ohio by license or law.
If the Planning Commission determines that expertise beyond that of City staff
is necessary to determine compliance with this criterion, then the applicant
shall reimburse the City for any expenses necessary for hiring a third-party
consultant to make this determination.
      (3)   Basketball Hoops.
         A.   Basketball courts shall be subject to the standards of Section
1113.01(e)(24).
         B.   Movable basketball hoops shall not be located in rights-of-way or
be so located as to require play in any right-of-way.
      (4)   Bike and Skateboard Ramps.  Bike ramps and skateboard ramps shall
be set back at least 15 feet from all lot lines.
      (5)   Community Gardens.
         A.   Community gardens that are accessory to another principal use
shall be subject to the same rules as established for community gardens in
Section
1109.03(b)(2).
         B.   Community gardens shall only serve as an accessory use to
nonresidential uses.
      (6)   Detached Garages and Carports and Detached Storage/Utility Sheds,
Gazebos, Pool Houses, and other Similar Buildings.
         A.   Attached and detached garages and carports shall be served by a
paved driveway.
         B.   The use shall comply with the following setbacks:
            i.   In R-1, R-2, and R-T Districts, there shall be a minimum
setback of five feet from all side and rear lot lines.
            ii.   In the R-3 and R-4 Districts, the structure shall comply with
the parking area setbacks established in Section
1125.03(b).
            iii.   In all other zoning districts:
               a.   Any structure that has a gross floor area of 200 square
feet or less shall comply with the parking setbacks set forth in Section
1125.03(b).
               b.   Any structure that is over 200 square feet shall comply
with the building setback requirements of Chapter
1115: Site Development Standards, but in no case shall the structure bet set
back less than five feet from any adjacent lot.
      (7)   Drive-Through Facilities.  The following standards shall apply to
businesses that contain a drive-through facility regardless if the drive-
through is part of another use (e.g., restaurant or financial institution) or
if it is a stand-alone use (e.g., automatic teller machine).
         A.   General Standards.
            i.   Audible electronic devices such as loudspeakers, automobile
service order devices, and similar instruments shall not be located within 250

portion of the sidewalk which is part of the public right-of-way in the C-
4 District only, provided no part of the awning or canopy projects into an
alley or alley right-of-way or street or interferes with existing light poles
(including attached banner supports) and existing trees and is a minimum of two
feet from the inside edge of the street curb or edge of street pavement where
no curb exists. If a street is widened and the sidewalk in the public right-of-
way is reduced in depth from the curb to the front property line of a lot, all
fixed and retractable awnings and canopies, which are closer than two feet from
the inside edge of the new street curb or pavement edge shall be removed or be
reduced in size to be in compliance with the minimum two-foot curb/pavement
edge setback regulation.
      (5)   Interior Lots.
         A.   The required minimum front yard setback shall be measured from
the street right-of-way or, where a right-of-way is not identified, the front
lot line. See Figure
1115-B.
         B.   The lot line located directly behind the rear of the structure,
as determined by the Zoning Administrator, shall be the rear lot line and the
rear yard setback shall be applied. See Figure
1115-B.
         C.   All other lot lines shall be considered the side lot line and the
side yard setback shall be applied. See Figure
1115-B.

streets shall be considered a corner lot, subject to the following:
         A.   The required minimum front yard setback shall be provided from
each street right-of-way or, where a right-of-way is not identified, the lot
line adjacent to the street. See Figure
1115-C. An alley shall not be considered a street for the purposes of
determining a corner lot.
         B.   The lot line that runs parallel with the lot line along the
narrowest street frontage shall be the rear lot line and the minimum rear yard
setback shall be applied from such lot line. See  Figure
1115-C
         C.   All other lot lines shall be a side lot line and the minimum side
yard setback shall be applied from such lot lines. See  Figure

      (10)   Other Lot Configurations.  Where there is an instance of a lot
configuration not addressed in the previous sections (e.g., interior, corner,
panhandle, etc.), or where there is an atypical building orientation on any
lot, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to make a determination
regarding where front, rear, and side yard setbacks are required.
   (e)   Height Measurement and Exceptions.
      (1)   Where specified in stories, building height shall be measured in
number of stories above the finished grade for any elevation fronting on a
public street including attics, half-stories, mezzanines, and at-grade
structured parking.  This excludes features that are less than one-half story
or completely below grade, such as basements, cellars, crawl spaces, sub-
basements, and underground parking structures.
      (2)   Where specified in feet, the building height shall be measured from
average elevation of the finished grade to the highest point on the roof,
regardless of roof type.

slope greater than 20 percent.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to waive the
application of these requirements when grading, special construction practices,
or the use of a retaining wall will address any safety issues and where the
character of the surrounding neighborhood will not be substantially altered
because of changes in building design or the natural grade.
      (4)   Slopes shall be determined by dividing the vertical rise in
elevation by the horizontal run of the same slope and converting the result
into a percentage value.
   (e)   Flood Hazard Areas.
      (1)   No residential dwelling or part thereof, except for approved
campgrounds, shall be erected within the 100-year floodplain as designated on
the most recently adopted Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      (2)   In the event a recreational dwelling is built within the
floodplain, then the dwelling shall be built above the base flood elevation, or
if the recreational dwelling is stilted, then the main structure of the
dwelling shall be built above the base flood elevation.

a development plan and shall be approved according to the procedures set forth
in Section
1105.07.  The lighting plan shall demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this section. However, a photometric study of the illumination shall only be
required when a multi-family dwelling with 10 or more units or a nonresidential
use is proposed to be located adjacent to a lot in a residential district or
that is occupied by an existing residential use.
      (2)   All existing uses on which exterior lighting is installed or
changed shall conform to these standards. 
      (3)   The lighting plan shall demonstrate compliance with the exterior
lighting standards of this section.

designed so as not to create dark spots that may create safety issues in such
areas as vehicular use areas and connecting pedestrian paths.
      (4)   For all nonresidential uses in the R-1, R-2, and R-T Districts, all
nonessential outdoor lighting fixtures, including parking, sign, display, and
aesthetic lighting, shall be turned off after business hours.  Only that
lighting needed for safety or security may remain lit after close of business,
in which case the lighting shall be reduced to the minimum level necessary.
      (5)   There shall be a maximum illumination of 0.5 footcandles at the lot
line in all residential districts and for any nonresidential use that abuts a
lot in a residential zoning district or lot occupied by an existing residential
use.

of the window or any window sign, permitted in accordance with Chapter
1127: Signage, provided that the window or door would be considered transparent
prior to the erection of the display or sign. 
      (4)   Any part of the building, which is not the front façade, that is
visible from a private right-of-way, parking area, or public circulation area
shall have no more than 25 percent of the wall length, not to exceed 75 feet,
of contiguous wall length devoid of windows, on any ground floor, unless the
wall includes architectural features such as piers, columns, defined bays, or
an undulation of the building so that a pedestrian scale, rhythm, and visual
interest is created.
   (f)   Mechanical Equipment.
      (1)   Wall mounted mechanical, electrical, communication equipment,
downspouts, gutters, service doors, and other building-mounted utility

principal structure), landscaping, mounds, parapets or enclosures constructed
of the same materials used on the majority of the principal structure or any
combination or as otherwise approved or required during development plan review
(See Section
1105.07.). 
      (5)   The screening of mechanical equipment will be reviewed on a case-
by-case basis based upon the following determinations:
         i)   Site location relative to adjacent properties and public rights-
of-way;
         ii)   Topography of the subject site relative to adjacent properties
and public rights-of-way;
         iii)   Whether the subject screening creates visual inconsistencies
with surrounding areas; and
         iv)   Whether the screening substantially meets the overall intent of
these district architectural guidelines.
      (6)   Mechanical equipment is also subject to Section
1123.07.
   (g)   Planning Commission Waiver.  The Planning Commission may waiver
portions of the above architectural standards for new construction in the C-1,
C-2, C-3, and C-4 Districts for any building that is not a designated Landmark

nearby buildings in the same zoning district; or
      (2)   The applicant proposes and alternative in that complies with
Section
1105.10. 
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1119.06  PRESERVATION STANDARDS FOR LANDMARKS AND LANDMARK DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means for the
designation and protection of Landmarks and Landmark Districts in the City of
Wooster pursuant to the procedures and standards of this code in order to
preserve, protect, and perpetuate places, buildings, structures, works of art,
and other objects having a special historical, community, or aesthetic interest
or value, all for the reasons described below:
      (1)   To safeguard the heritage of the City by preserving sites and
structures that reflect elements of the City's cultural, social, economic,
political, archeological, or architectural history;
      (2)   To stabilize and improve property values;
      (3)   To enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity and
interest of the City;
      (4)   To foster civic pride in the beauty and notable accomplishments of
the past;
      (5)   To promote the use and preservation of historic and archeological
sites and structures for the education and general welfare of the people of the
City; and
      (6)   To take necessary measures to safeguard the property rights of the
owners whose property is declared to be a Landmark or is located in an area
designated as a Landmark District.
   (b)   Designation of a Landmark or Landmark District.  The City may, from
time to time, consider the designation of structures, buildings, or places
within the City as Landmarks or Landmark Districts through the procedure
established in Section
1105.09.
   (c)   Certificate of Appropriateness Required.  A certificate of
appropriateness may be required for any construction, reconstruction,
demolition, relocation, or other exterior alteration of a structure, building,
or use as defined in Section
1105.08.
   (d)   Determining the Significance of a Structure.
      (1)   When making decisions or recommendations about changes to Landmarks
or structures in a Landmark District, the Design Review Board shall have the
authority to make a determination of the historical significance of the
structure based on this section.
      (2)   For structures that the Design Review Board finds are not
historically significant, the board may relax or waive the standards or
guidelines found in the City of Wooster Design Guidelines for Landmarks and
Landmark Districts. 
      (3)   If the Design Review Board finds that the structure is historically
significant, the standards and guidelines of the design guidelines or this
chapter may be fully applied at the discretion of the Design Review Board and
as further described in the design guidelines or in this chapter.
      (4)   The Design Review Board shall determine whether a structure or site
is significant based on the structure's:
         A.   Value as a reminder of the cultural or archaeological heritage of
the City, State, or nation;
         B.   Location as a site of a significant local, state, or national
event;
         C.   Identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the City, State, or nation;
         D.   Identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the City, State, or nation;
         E.   Value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that it retains sufficient elements showing such architectural
significance;
         F.   Example of an architectural style or period;
         G.   Contribution to the historical nature of the overall site; and/or
         H.   Character as a contributing element in a Landmark District.
   (e)   Review Standards and Guidelines.
      (1)   In addition to any applicable standards of the applicable zoning
district or standards found in this chapter, any construction, modification,
expansion, or other changes subject to a certificate of appropriateness review
shall be subject to the applicable design standards and guidelines that are
established in the City of Wooster Design Guidelines for Landmarks and Landmark
Districts, as adopted by City Council. The manual shall hereafter be referred
to as the design guidelines.
      (2)   The following design criteria shall apply to all buildings, site
elements, structures and property designated as Landmarks or within a Landmark
District:
         A.   All construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration,
demolition, or other exterior structure or site element change shall preserve
the character, historical significance, and architectural style of the existing
buildings, site elements, structures and property. Such changes shall be
visually compatible with the subject structure, property and area, and a false
sense of history shall not be created.
         B.   Traditional building materials such as wood, brick, metal, or
stone shall be used for construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or
other exterior structure or site element change. Modern man-made materials may
be utilized at the discretion of the Design Review Board if the proposed
project keeps in character with the existing building, site, area structures,
and design guidelines.
         C.   For new construction and additions, the structure's width,
height, surrounding setbacks and style shall be considered in relationship to
adjacent structures.  This relationship between structures shall allow for
consistency of style, size and density in each given neighborhood area.
         D.   Where possible, elements which can contribute to the quality of
the pedestrian environment and other public amenities should be promoted. 
Included among these may be benches, water features, seating areas, arcades,
awnings or canopies.
         E.   Signage shall be proportionally scaled and appropriately designed
to coalesce with the subject building, site and area.
   (f)   Changes Not Prohibited.  Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to
prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural
feature of any property which has been designated a Landmark or which is
situated in a designated Landmark District, and which does not involve a change
in design, material, or outer appearance thereof; nor to prevent any
environmental or changes to the building that the Building Standards or Fire
Divisions shall certify in writing is required by the public safety because of
an unsafe or dangerous condition.

that contributes to the quality of the overall project, as determined by the
Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator, as may be applicable based on the
review procedure.
   (b)   Permitted Uses in Open Spaces.  The following uses may be permitted in
required open space:
      (1)   Areas preserved in their natural state as wetlands, woodlands,
lakes or ponds, historic lands, environmentally sensitive areas, or similar
conservation-oriented areas;
      (2)   Community gardens (See Section
1109.03(b)(2).);
      (3)   Outdoor active or passive recreational uses for the use and/or
enjoyment of the residents of the proposed development. Any restricted open
space intended to be devoted to recreational activities shall be of a usable
size and shape for the intended purposes as determined by the Planning

natural features to the extent practicable.
      (5)   Any area within the open space that is disturbed during
construction or otherwise not preserved in its natural state, shall be
landscaped with vegetation that is compatible with the natural characteristics
of the site.
      (6)   All open space required by this chapter, including any recreational
facilities proposed to be constructed in such space, shall be clearly shown on
all approved plans.
      (7)   Where open areas, trails, parks, or other open space resources are
planned or exist adjacent to development, the open space shall, to the maximum
extent practicable, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently
existing trail, park, or other open area land.
      (8)   Provision of Open Space in Multi-Phase Developments.
         A.   Development proposed in phases shall be considered as a single
development for the purposes of applying the open space set-aside standards
required in this chapter.
         B.   The open space set-aside for the entire project shall be reviewed
and approved as part of the preliminary plat process.
         C.   Development shall not be phased solely as a method to avoid the
minimum open space set-aside standards in this chapter. 
         D.   In cases where less than 100 percent of the total amount of open
space set-aside is provided within the first phase of a multi-phase
development, the open space set-aside required shall, at a minimum, be
apportioned into each of the remaining development phases. At any point, the
applicant may fulfill the open space set-aside requirements prior to completion
of the development or subdivision.
            (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18; Ord. 2019-17.  Passed 10-7-19.)
   1121.04  OWNERSHIP OF OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   The first priority of the open space requirement is to provide for a
community wide network of parks, open spaces, greenways, or other recreational
areas. As such, all open space required by this chapter shall first be offered
to the City for potential public land dedication.
   (b)   Such offer for public land dedication shall be made during the
applicable review procedure and the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator
with authority to make a decision during the applicable review procedure shall
also have the authority to decide whether to recommend that the land should be
considered by City Council for public dedication.
   (c)   The City shall consider any recommendation from Planning Commission or
Zoning Administrator regarding the proposed land and shall make a decision on
whether to accept any land offered for dedication. City Council shall not be
required to accept any land offered for dedication.
   (d)   Where the City chooses not to accept the open space for public
dedication, the developer shall retain the open space as private open space,
protected in perpetuity in accordance with Section
1121.05. 
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1121.05  PROTECTION OF OPEN SPACES.

be prohibited.
   (b)   In all cases, the long-term control and protection of the open space
shall be accomplished through the use of a conservation easement.
   (c)   The applicant may seek to dedicate the open space to the City of
Wooster, however the City is not required to accept such dedication. If the
open space is not dedicated to, and accepted by, the City, the long-term
control and protection of the open space shall be accomplished through the use
of a conservation easement in accordance with this section.
   (d)   Conservation Easements.
      (1)   At the time when an applicant records the plat for the approved
subdivision or submits for a zoning certificate where no plat is required, a
conservation easement shall be placed on all lands and private waters used to
satisfy the open space requirements of this chapter. The conservation easement
shall:
         A.   Run with the land, regardless of ownership;
         B.   Provide for protection of the land in perpetuity;
         C.   Be granted and deeded to the City, Wayne County, State of Ohio,
park district, a City approved land trust, or other qualified organization
approved by the Planning Commission and Law Director; and
         D.   Be solely for the purpose of ensuring the land remains
undeveloped other than development of uses permitted by Section
1121.03(b).
      (2)   While the City, Wayne County, State, park district, City approved
land trust, or other qualified organization may hold the conservation easement,
the property itself shall still be owned by the original property owner, the
developer (applicant of the subdivision), or a homeowners' or property owners'
association. If it is to be owned by an association, the association's
documents shall be recorded with the subdivision plat and a copy submitted to
the Zoning Administrator to be maintained as part of the City's records.
      (3)   The conservation easement shall include information on how the
property will be maintained by the property owner and shall also state that
failure to maintain the property in accordance with the conservation easement
agreements shall be considered a violation of this code. In addition, the
holder of the easement may pursue any remedy provided by law or equity,
including, but not limited to, the remedies in Section 5301.70 of the Ohio
Revised Code. 
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1121.06  STANDARDS FOR OWNERS' ASSOCIATIONS.
   (a)   A homeowners' association or property owners' association shall be
established to permanently maintain all open space and common areas if such
areas are not transferred and accepted by the City, Wayne County, State, park
district, City approved land trust, or other qualified organization.
   (b)   All homeowners' association or property owners' association agreements
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator as part of the development plan
review, subdivision application review, or PD review, whichever is applicable.
No set of proposed covenants, articles of incorporation, or bylaws of a
homeowner's association or property owners' association shall permit the
abrogation of any duties set forth in this section.
      (1)   All homeowners' associations or property owners' associations shall
guarantee the maintenance of all open space and common areas within the
boundaries of the development through the deed restrictions or covenants.
      (2)   Membership in the association shall be mandatory for all purchasers
of lots in the development.
      (3)   The association shall be responsible for maintenance, control, and
insurance of all common areas, including required open space.
      (4)   In the event that the homeowners' association or property owners'
association no longer maintains the common areas and open space in a neat and
orderly manner, or if the homeowners' association or property owners'
association goes defunct, the City may take over maintenance and assess a fee
to cover the costs of such maintenance. The fee shall be assessed to each of
the benefitting property owners within the subdivision.
      (5)   The association shall not authorize its dissolution or the sale,
transfer or other disposal of any common area, including restricted open space,
without:
         A.   An affirmative vote of 75 percent of its members;
         B.   Establishing a successor entity to take over said property
pursuant to this code; and
         C.   The approval of the City Council.
      (6)   Whenever the association adopts an amendment to any approved
agreements that pertain to maintenance obligations or access to common areas,
the revisions shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator for confirmation
that the amendment is in compliance with all applicable standards of this code
and any conditions of approval that applied to the original development or
subdivision.
      (7)   The association shall convey to the City and other appropriate
governmental bodies, after proper notice, the right to enter to any common area
for emergency purposes or in the event of nonperformance of maintenance or
improvements affecting the public health, safety and welfare. Such governments
shall have the right, after proper notice, to make improvements and perform
maintenance functions. In addition, the City shall have the right to proceed
against the Association for reimbursements of said costs, including the right
to file liens against individual condominium units, houses, and vacant building
lots.

will be screened from adjacent public streets or from adjacent properties. In
addition, this section delineates standards for landscaping within parking
lots.
      (2)   Whenever required landscaping is located within or adjacent to
parking lots or driveways, such screening shall be protected by bollards, wheel
blocks, or curbing to avoid damage by vehicles.
      (3)   This section shall only apply to properties with parking lots that
contain five or more parking spaces.
      (4)   Perimeter Landscaping.
         A.   Perimeter landscaping shall be required when an applicable
parking lot abuts adjoining property that is not a right-of-way.
         B.   The perimeter landscaping shall not be required if the parking
lot is a shared lot with the adjoining property.
         C.   A landscaped strip meeting the required minimum parking setback
(in depth) of the applicable zoning district shall be located between the
parking lot and the abutting lot lines. See Section
1125.03(b).
         D.   The landscaped strip shall include one large deciduous tree, two
small deciduous trees, or one evergreen tree for each 50 linear feet of parking

         F.   The requirements for this section shall not apply where planting
is required for buffering in accordance with Section
1123.06.
      (5)   Buffering of Parking Lots.  When a parking lot is located adjacent
to a public street right-of-way, screening shall be provided to reduce the
visual impact of the parking lot.  A landscaped buffer shall be installed
between the parking lot and public rights-of-way per the following
requirements: 
         A.   A landscaped buffer shall be located directly adjacent to the
parking lot and be no less than 10 feet in width in all districts, except the
C-4 District, where the buffer may be three feet wide. The buffer shall be
composed of a continuous evergreen hedge or dense planting of evergreen shrubs.
         B.   Landscaping shall be at a height of no less than three feet at
the time of installation.  Landscaping may be placed upon a berm to achieve the
required height at planting except in the C-4 District where the use of a berm
is prohibited. The minimum buffer height requirement shall not apply when the
grading of the site results in an elevation of the adjacent street which is
three or more feet higher than the parking lot.
         C.   A fence or a wall may be incorporated into the landscape buffer
per the fence requirements of the applicable zoning district. See Section
1113.01.
      (6)   Interior Landscaping.
         A.   There shall be a minimum of 10 square feet of interior
landscaping for every parking space.
         B.   The interior landscaping shall be located within landscaped
islands that are separated from the perimeter landscaping required in Section
1123.05(b)(4), and shall be scattered throughout the parking area to break up
large areas of pavement. Landscaped islands that are designed as extensions
from the perimeter landscaping areas shall also be considered as interior
parking area landscaping but shall not count as the perimeter landscaping area.
See Figure
1123-A.

shall be planted with grass, ground cover (including mulch, river rock, or
similar materials constructed of natural materials), or other live landscape
treatment.
         G.   At least one large deciduous tree must be provided per ten
parking spaces within landscape islands, provided there is no impairment to
visibility of motorists or pedestrians. In no case shall there be less than one
tree planted in each landscaped island.
         H.   If the specific application of the interior landscape
requirements will seriously limit functions of the building site, the Zoning
Administrator shall have authority to permit consolidation and relocation of
these landscaped areas on the building site.
            (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1123.06  BUFFERING BETWEEN LAND USE AND ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to establish provisions for a
visual screen or buffer between incompatible uses and to reduce the effects of
glare from automobile headlights, noise and other objectionable activities
conducted on a given lot.
   (b)   Buffer Requirements.  Table
1123-3 shall establish when a buffer yard is required between uses and zoning
districts.
 
TABLE 1123-3: REQUIRED BUFFERS
                               Adjacent To:
                              Any Use in an R-1, R-2,  Any lot in an R-3 or R-
                               or R-T District          4 District
Proposed Use:                                           
Any nonresidential use in an   X
R-1, R-2, R-T or PD District
Any use in an R-3 or R-
4 District except single-      X
family or two-family dwellings
Any use in a C-1, C-2, C-3, C-
4, CF, I-1, I-2 or I-          X                        X
3 District
 
   (c)   Required Buffer Width.  The width of the buffer yard shall be equal to
the parking set back set forth in the applicable zoning district (See Section
1125.03(b).) or 10 feet, whichever is greater.
   (d)   Location of Buffers.
      (1)   The landscape buffer shall be provided along the entire lot line
between the two adjacent uses identified in Table
1123-3.
      (2)   Buffers required by this section shall be located completely on the
lot subject to the buffer requirement and only along the outer perimeter of the
lot where it abuts another lot, and shall extend to the lot line or right-of-
way line.
      (3)   The buffer yard may be placed in the lower intensity zoning
district or partially within both zoning districts if both sides of the zoning
district line and the entire buffer yard width are within common ownership and
a permanent easement is provided over any portion of the buffer yard not within
the higher-intensity zoning district.
      (4)   If a buffer yard is located in a residential development that has
an owners' association or other similar legal entity, all buffer yards shall be
located in open space owned by the association or in an open space easement
controlled by the owners' association.
      (5)   When property lines abut an adjacent jurisdiction, the Planning
Commission shall determine the specific screening and buffering requirements
along that property line after consideration of the zoning designation and or
land use of the adjacent property.  Requirements shall not exceed those that
would be required for similarly situated/zoned property within the City of
Wooster.
   (e)   Vegetation Requirements within the Buffer.  When the natural
vegetation within the required buffer yard does not form a solid, continuous,
visual screen or does not have a minimum height of six feet along the entire
length of the common boundary at the time of occupancy, screening shall be
installed in compliance with this subsection.
      (1)   Screening design and development shall be compatible with the
existing and proposed land use and development character of the surrounding
land and structures. Screening within the buffer yard shall consist of one or
more or combination thereof of the following:
         A.   A dense vegetative planting incorporating trees and/or shrubs of
a variety which shall be equally effective in winter and summer. Trees and/or
shrubs shall be adequately spaced to form a solid, continuous visual screen
within three years after the initial installation. At a minimum, at the time of
planting, the spacing of trees shall not exceed 12 feet on center, and the
planting pattern shall be staggered. Shrubbery shall be more closely spaced.
         B.   Non-living opaque structures such as a solid masonry wall that is
compatible in materials and color with the principal structure, or a solid wood
fence, together with a landscaped area at least 10 feet wide. The fences and
walls shall comply with the standards of Section
1113.01.
         C.   An ornamental fence with openings through which light and air may
pass together with a landscaped area at least 10 feet wide.  The fences shall
comply with the standards of Section
1113.01.
         D.   A landscaped mound or berm at least seven feet wide.
      (2)   The location of the wall, fence, or vegetation shall be placed
within the buffer yard to maximize the screening effect, as determined by the
Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission.
      (3)   The wall, fence, and vegetation shall be continuous and in place at
the time of occupancy. If vehicular or pedestrian access through the screen is
necessary, the screening function shall be preserved.
      (4)   The height of screening shall be in accordance with the following:
         A.   Visual screening by walls, fences, or mounds in combination with
vegetation, fences or walls shall be a minimum of six feet high measured from
the natural grade, except as set forth in sub-section B. below.
         B.   Whenever the required screening is located within a front yard,
the required screening shall not exceed a height of three feet.
         C.   When used alone, vegetation shall be a minimum of six feet high,
as measured from the natural grade, in order to accomplish the desired
screening effect. The required height shall be achieved no later than three
years after the initial installation.
   (f)   Development within Required Buffers.  The required buffer shall not
contain any development, impervious surfaces, or site features that do not
function to meet the standards of this section or that require removal of
existing vegetation, except for the following features:
      (1)   Fences or walls;
      (2)   Sidewalks, trails, and other elements associated with passive
recreation, if all required landscaping is provided;
      (3)   Signs and light posts;
      (4)   Driveways, access roads, and similar uses if they cross
perpendicularly across a required buffer, are designed to limit disturbance of
vegetation; or
      (5)   Overhead and underground utilities required or allowed by the City.
         (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1123.07  SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   General Requirements.  In addition to the other forms of required
landscaping, screening shall be required to conceal specific areas of high
visual or auditory impact or hazardous areas from adjacent, less intense uses
and from views from public rights-of-way. Such areas shall be screened at all
times, unless otherwise specified, regardless of adjacent uses, districts, or
other proximate landscaping material.
   (b)   Screened Items.
      (1)   The following areas shall be screened in accordance with this
section:

visible from adjacent rights-of-way or from adjacent lots in any residential,
commercial, or special zoning districts.
      (3)   All sides of the item shall be screened with the exception that one
side of the item may be screened with a gate or other similar feature to allow
access while screening the item when access is not necessary.
   (c)   Screening Methods.
      (1)   The following items are permitted for use as screening materials,
and more than one method may be used on a lot or site.
         A.   Vegetative materials that provide a fully opaque screen to the
minimum height necessary to fully screen the facility from off-site views (See
Figure
1123-C.); or
         B.   An opaque fence or wall consistent with the standards of Section
1113.01; or
         C.   Integration into the building design (e.g., false walls or other
architectural screening) that utilizes the same building materials and colors
as the principal building.
      (2)   The required screening shall have a height sufficient enough to
screen the applicable item(s) provided it is in accordance with any other
applicable sections of this code.
      (3)   For loading spaces, a single gap of no more than 40 feet shall be
permitted to allow for ingress and egress to a loading area. All other required
screening shall have a minimum height of six feet and may include a mound with
a maximum height of three feet.
      (4)   Alternative screening materials that are not listed or alternative
configurations may be proposed as part of an equivalency provision review
application. See Section

   (d)   Configuration of Vegetative Materials.  In cases where vegetative
materials are used for screening in accordance with this subsection, the
vegetative materials shall:
      (1)   Be planted around the perimeter of the site feature to be screened
in a manner that screens the site feature from all off-site views;
      (2)   Be configured in two staggered rows or other arrangement that
provides maximum screening;
      (3)   Be upright, large evergreen shrubs or a hedge and be capable of
reaching at least six feet in height within three years of planting; and
      (4)   Be spaced no farther than necessary to create an opaque screen when
the shrubs or trees are fully grown. In no case shall trees used for screening
be spaced further than eight feet apart on center.
         (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1123.08  MODIFICATIONS TO BUFFERING AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
   The buffering and screening requirements of Section
1123.06 and Section
1123.07 shall be applied equally to all similarly situated properties.  The
Zoning Administrator is empowered to modify the above buffering and screening
requirements if, and only if:
   (a)   Natural land characteristics such as topography or existing vegetation
on the proposed building site would achieve the same intent as the applicable
sections;
   (b)   Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the
building site to achieve an equivalent screening and buffering effect;
   (c)   The required screening and landscaping would be ineffective at
maturity due to the proposed topography of the site, and/or the location of the
improvements on the site;
   (d)   The topography of adjacent and surrounding sites is such as to render
required screening ineffective at maturity;
   (e)   A written request is received from the owners of the abutting
residential district property that the screening as required herein should be
waived or varied based on stated purposes; or
   (f)   It can be clearly demonstrated that it is highly improbable that the
abutting property will be developed for residential purposes due to
circumstances, which have taken place since the adoption of the comprehensive
plan and this code.

toward off-street parking space requirements except as may otherwise be
provided for in this code. 
      (2)   Driveway Space Meeting Parking Requirements.  Entrances, exits, or
driveways shall not be computed as any part of a required parking lot or area,
except in the case of single-family or two-family dwellings where driveways may
be used in calculating the amount of off-street parking.
      (3)   Multiple Uses.  Where a building or group of buildings on the same
lot contains two or more uses, the parking areas shall include a number of
spaces that equals the combined total of parking spaces required for each
individual use, except as otherwise allowed in this chapter.
      (4)   Area Measurements.  All square footage-based parking standards
shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area of all floors in the
building. Up to 15 percent of the gross floor area may be excluded from the
above calculation if the area is used for storage accessory to the principal
use, restrooms, utilities or other maintenance areas, loading and unloading
docks, and other areas incidental to the principal use.
      (5)   Capacity- Based Standards.
         A.   For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on
employees, students, residents, or occupants, calculations shall be based on
the typical, or average, number of persons working on a single shift, the
typical, or average, enrollment, or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever
is lesser.
         B.   In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as beds.
         C.   In the case of benches, pews, and similar seating accommodations
that do not have individual seats, each 24 inches of length of seating shall be
counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the parking requirements.
      (6)   Unlisted Uses.
         A.   Upon receiving an application for a use not specifically listed
or addressed in the parking schedule in Section
1125.04, the Zoning Administrator shall apply the parking standard specified
for the listed use that the Zoning deems most similar to the proposed use in
regards to use, size and intensity of use.
         B.   If the Zoning Administrator determines that there is no listed
use similar to the proposed use, intensity, or size, the Zoning Administrator
may refer to the estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the
American Planning Association (APA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and/or the
Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE).
         C.   The Zoning Administrator's decision regarding parking
requirements for a specific use is appealable to the BZA as established in

   (c)   Uses with Variable Parking Demand Characteristics.  Uses that
reference this subsection in Table
1125-2 have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it difficult
to establish a single off-street parking standard. Applicants that propose a
use subject to this subsection shall submit information with their application
on the size of building, potential employment, proposed seating, applicable
fire capacity information and similar information along with justification on
how the proposed number and design of parking spaces is sufficient for the
proposed use. The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to review and
make a decision on the proposed number of parking spaces based on the
information submitted by the applicant and any estimates of parking demand
based on recommendations of the American Planning Association (APA), the Urban
Land Institute (ULI) and/or the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE).
   (d)   Alternative Parking Solutions.  The total amount of parking spaces
required in Section
1125.04 may be reduced by 50 percent utilizing one or more of the following
alternative parking solutions.
      (1)   Deferred Construction of Required Spaces.  If the number of parking
spaces required in Table
1125-2 is substantially larger than the number anticipated by the applicant and
the applicant provides sufficient evidence that supports the reduced parking
needs, an application may be approved with an allowance for the construction of
a lesser number of parking spaces provided that:
Figure 1125-A: The parking lot shown on the left is a traditional parking lot
with interior parking islands while the parking lot on the right illustrates
where an area is unimproved but is designated for future parking spaces if the
demand arises.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2095.jpg]
 
         A.   The parking plan submitted with the application shall denote the
location and layout of that portion of the parking area that currently is
deemed not required.  The plan shall indicate that the deferred parking spaces
will be constructed according to these regulations in the event that the
Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator determines at any time that all or
any portion of this parking is necessary.
         B.   The applicant shall be required to provide a plan or drawings
that shows the site designed for full compliance with the applicable stormwater
regulations, lighting regulations, and landscaping regulations as if the entire
parking area was to be constructed even though a portion of the parking area
may not be developed initially.
         C.   At no time shall any portion of the required parking area that is
so designated for future vehicular use area construction be used for the
construction of any other structure or paved surface unless in compliance with
the original plans identified in Paragraph B above. Such construction of the
vehicular use area shall require a zoning certificate.
         D.   At no time shall any portion of the required parking that is so
designated for future construction as provided herein be counted as open space
or other non-paved areas required by other provisions of this section.
         E.   The owner of record shall be required to begin construction of
the approved deferred parking area(s), as identified on the approved parking
plan, within six months of written notice from the Zoning Administrator,
identifying that such parking is determined to be necessary.  Such
determination may be made:
            i.   When the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator, as
applicable, is reviewing an application related to a change of use or activity;
or
            ii.   When the Zoning Administrator, or their designee, documents
that vehicles related to the use are consistently parked on the grass,
landscaping area, on other properties, or on the street.
         F.   Construction of the deferred parking area must be completed
within one year of the written notice identified in paragraph
1125.04(d)(1)E above. Failure to construct the remaining parking area within
the applicable timeframe shall be considered a violation of this code.
      (2)   Shared Parking or Off-Site Parking.  Shared parking or off-site
parking may be authorized under this code subject to the requirements of this
section. In all cases, both types of alternative parking solutions shall comply
with Section
1125.04(d)(2)C.
         A.   Shared Parking Option.
            i.   Shared parking is encouraged and permitted if the multiple
uses that the shared parking will benefit can cooperatively establish and
operate the facilities and they are located on adjacent properties.
            ii.   Shared parking is not permitted to serve residential uses
except in the C-4 District.
            iii.   The applicant shall have the burden of proof for reduction
of the total number of parking spaces and shall document and submit information
substantiating their request.
            iv.   Parking spaces to be shared shall not be reserved for a
specific person, individual, or use on a 24-hour basis.
            v.   Accessible parking spaces shall not be shared, unless the uses
that are to share the spaces are adjacent to the accessible spaces and no
inconvenience to the users of such spaces would be created.
            vi.   Parking facilities to be shared shall be located on the same
lot as the use for which the parking space is intended, except when the parking
facility complies with the off-site parking option.
            vii.   Shared parking may be approved if:
               a.   A sufficient number of spaces is provided to meet the
highest demand of the participating uses;
               b.   The number of shared spaces is equal to or less than 50
percent of the least intense use to utilize the shared parking; and
               c.   Evidence has been submitted by the parties operating the
shared parking facility, to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator,
documenting the nature of uses and the hours when the individual uses will
operate so as to demonstrate the lack of potential conflict between them.
         B.   Off-Site Parking Option.
            i.   Off-site parking shall not be used to satisfy the off-street
parking standards for residential uses except in the C-4 District.
            ii.   Required parking spaces reserved for persons with
disabilities shall not be located in an off-site parking area.
            iii.   No off-site parking space shall be located more than 800
feet from the primary entrance of the use served, measured along the shortest
legal, practical walking route. This route may include crossing a right-of-way
provided it uses a legal crosswalk.
            iv.   If an off-site parking area is located in a different zoning
district than the use served, the off-site parking areas shall still adhere to
the vehicular use landscaping regulations of Section
1123.05.
            v.   Off-site parking for a nonresidential use shall not be
permitted in a residential zoning district.
            vi.   Contiguous lots providing off-street parking for more than
one use shall provide sufficient spaces to comply with the combined total
parking requirements for all uses except when the allowance for shared parking
is granted in compliance with this section. 
         C.   Parking Agreement Required.  A parking agreement shall be
required for shared or off-site parking arrangements in accordance with this
section.
            i.   The agreement shall be subject to review and approval by the
City's Law Director and shall provide for the rights of the respective parties
to use the parking areas as shared or off-site parking areas.
            ii.   The agreement shall include provisions and evidence of deed
restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the spaces will be
properly maintained during the life of the development.
            iii.   The agreement shall include language that states that no
changes shall be made to the shared or off-site parking facility that would
reduce the parking provided for the applicable uses, unless the parties of the
agreement agree to make other arrangements to provide parking that will comply
with this chapter.  No such changes shall be made without Zoning Administrator
approval prior to any changes taking place.
            iv.   The approved shared agreement shall be filed with the
application for a zoning certificate and shall be filed with the Wayne County
Recorder's Office in a manner as to encumber all properties involved in the
parking agreement.
            v.   The applicant shall be required to provide proof that the
agreement has been recorded with the Wayne County Recorder's Office prior to
the issuance of a zoning certificate.
   (e)   Design of Off-Street Parking Areas.  Off-street parking areas shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements.
      (1)   Access to Parking.  Access to parking areas shall be provided as
follows for all parking areas other than garages for individual dwelling units:
         A.   Parking areas shall provide suitable maneuvering area so that
vehicles enter from, and exit to, a public street in a forward direction only.
         B.   Parking lots shall be designed to prevent access at any point
other than at designated access drives.
      (2)   Parking Lots Adjacent to Buildings.  All off-street parking spaces
for uses other than single-family and two-family dwellings shall be set back a
minimum of six feet from any wall of a building if such wall contains ground
floor openings other than a garage door providing access, light, or ventilation
to the building.
      (3)   Parking in Designated Areas Only.  Any vehicle parked on any lot
shall be so parked only in parking areas specifically constructed for such
purposes, and shall not be parked on tree lawns, sidewalks, lawns or other
areas required by this code to be landscaped.
      (4)   Parking Space Dimensions.  Each parking space shall have direct and
unrestricted access to an aisle of the minimum width set out in Table
1125-3 and illustrated in Figure 1125-B.

   1125.05  VEHICLE WAITING SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Drive-through facilities and other establishments which, by their
nature, create lines of customers waiting to be served within automobiles,
shall provide off-street waiting areas, on the same lot as the use, in addition
to the required number of parking spaces specified in Section
1125.04.
   (b)   The number of required waiting spaces shall be as provided for in
Table
1125-4.

   (c)   Waiting lanes shall be provided for any use having a drive-through
facility and shall comply with the following standards:
      (1)   Drive-through waiting lanes shall have a minimum width of eight
feet and a minimum length of 18 feet for each space required.
      (2)   When waiting lanes are separated from other waiting lanes, bypass
lanes, or from other site areas, the separation shall be by means of a raised
concrete median, concrete curb, landscaping, or painted striping.
      (3)   The number of waiting spaces required by Table
1125-4 shall be required for each separate waiting lane. If two or more waiting
lanes converge into one lane (e.g., two lane separate lanes to order at a
restaurant converge to one lane after the drive-through sign), the waiting
spaces shall be measured in accordance with Table
1125-4 with the spaces located after the convergence point counting toward both
waiting lanes.
      (4)   Vehicles shall not be permitted to wait within the public right-of-
way for service at such drive-in or drive-through facilities.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may reduce the number of required waiting
spaces when the applicant provides credible documentation, such as studies from
similar sites, that fewer than the required number of waiting spaces does not
impede vehicular traffic flow on the site and ingress/egress to the site.   
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1125.06  OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   Loading and unloading facilities shall be provided prior to occupancy of
every nonresidential building hereafter erected, altered, or to be occupied by
a new user, and shall be maintained as long as such building is occupied or
unless equivalent facilities are provided in conformance with the regulations
of this chapter.
   (a)   The Zoning Administrator may waive loading/unloading requirements
based on the character of the proposed use or the impracticality of adding
loading/unloading docks to existing buildings.
   (b)   All loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use served,
in a manner that enables the orderly and safe movement of trucks and no part of
any required yard, off-street parking area, nor access drive thereto, shall be
used for loading or unloading purposes, except that the Zoning Administrator
may allow two or more uses to cooperatively provide off-street loading/
unloading spaces, subject to the assurance of permanent availability.
   (c)   Off-street loading spaces shall not be used for repair or servicing of
motor vehicles.
   (d)   Each required off-street loading/unloading space shall be designed for
direct vehicular access by means of a driveway, or driveways, to a public
street, provided, however, that loading/unloading shall not be from the public
right of way except in situations of existing commercial facilities in the C-
4 District where no other opportunity for loading/unloading exists.
   (e)   When a building includes a combination of uses as set forth in this
section, the required number of loading spaces will be the sum of the required
loading spaces for each use. In no case shall the development be required to
provide in excess of 5 loading spaces.
   (f)   Classification of Loading Spaces.  A loading space shall consist of a
rectangular area of one or more of the following classes:
      (1)   Class A: An area at least fourteen feet by fifty-five feet having a
vertical clearance of fifteen feet or more, plus adequate area for ingress and
egress.
      (2)   Class B: An area at least twelve feet by thirty feet having a
vertical clearance of fifteen feet or more, plus adequate area for ingress and
egress.
   (g)   Number of Loading Spaces Required.  Every nonresidential building
shall provide a loading space pursuant to the provisions in Table
1125-5 unless otherwise waived in accordance with Section
1125.06(a).
 
TABLE 1125-5: MINIMUM NUMBER OF LOADING SPACES REQUIRED

(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1125.07  REGULATIONS FOR ACCESS DRIVES AND TRAFFIC FLOW.
   The location, width, and number of entrance and exit access drives to
accessory parking spaces shall be in accordance with the Section
1125.08, for those sites located on an arterial or collector road.  For all
other sites, the following, as well as Subsection
1125.08(b), shall apply:
   (a)   Entrances to parking lots shall be only from an adjoining public
street or alley or from a permanent private, access easement.  Adequate ingress
and egress to the parking lot by means of clearly limited and defined drives
shall be provided for vehicles.  Ingress and egress for a parking lot lying in
an area zoned for other than residential use shall not be across land in a
residential district.
   (b)   The location and width of entrance and exit access drives to parking
facilities shall be planned to interfere as little as possible with the use of
nearby property and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the nearest
streets.  Access drives shall be located at least 50 feet from the right-of-way
line of the nearest intersecting street.
   (c)   Driveways shall be setback a minimum of three feet from any lot line
with the exception of the one where the drive connects to the street. Such
setback shall not apply to shared driveways.
   (d)   Number of Drives.
      (1)   Each parcel shall have not more than two access drives from each
abutting street unless otherwise permitted below.
      (2)   One additional access drive may be permitted for lots that have 200
or more feet of frontage on one street.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may permit an additional access drive for
lots that have more than 500 feet of frontage when the Planning Commission
determines it is in the interest of good traffic operation.
      (4)   Insofar as practical, the use of common drives by two or more uses
shall be encouraged to reduce the number of such access points. 
   (e)   Cross-Access Requirements.
      (1)   Development that includes nonresidential uses shall allow for
shared, private vehicular access among all buildings and/or lots within the
development and with adjacent lots to the maximum extent feasible in order to
facilitate movement of customers and their vehicles without generating
additional turning movements on public streets.
      (2)   Where cross access is provided across multiple lots, a cross-access
easement shall be recorded with the Wayne County Recorder prior to issuance of
a certificate of occupancy. Cross access shall be provided subject to the
following provisions:
         A.   Cross-access routes shall permit shared automobile access to
driveways and parking areas for all nonresidential uses in the development, and
to the maximum extent feasible, to adjacent lots and development. The use of
parking spaces may be restricted to the owner's customers and tenants only.
         B.   The Zoning Administrator may waive the requirement for cross
access, in whole or in part, administratively, where cross-access is deemed
impractical due to vehicular safety issues or environmental constraints such as
severe topography.
   (f)   Driveway Entrances.  All driveway entrances and other openings onto
streets within the City shall be constructed so that:
      (1)   Vehicles can exit from the lot in question without having to back
up, except lots that contain single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings;
and
      (2)   Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in
abutting or surrounding streets is minimized.
         (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1125.08  ACCESS MANAGEMENT.
   Improvements and roadway access required as the result of site development
shall be located; designed; and constructed to provide safe access to property
and enable safe traffic flow throughout the City.  It is recognized that land
use and site planning issues are directly related to the capacity of roadways
to efficiently move traffic through an area and provide safe access to
adjoining property.  It is also recognized that achieving an appropriate
balance between roadway access to adjoining property and the ability of
roadways to carry through traffic will not only reduce future congestion and
accident rates, but will also enhance emergency vehicle response times.
   (a)   State Access Management Standards.  In reviewing development projects
adjacent to arterial and collector streets, the Planning Commission and the
City Engineer shall require adherence to the State of Ohio Department of
Transportation State Highway Access Management Manual, current edition, as well
as the City's Engineering Construction Standards for access management, current
edition.
   (b)   Other Access Management Standards.
      (1)   The minimum distance between nonresidential access drives, on
adjacent parcels, shall be as set forth in the Ohio Department of
Transportation, State Highway Access Manual, current edition, for all parcels
located on state routes within the City's corporation limits.
      (2)   The minimum distance for nonresidential drives on other City
streets shall be as set forth in the Engineering Construction Standards,
current edition.
      (3)   The Planning Commission, upon a recommendation from the City
Engineer, may grant an exception to the regulations in this subsection when the
Planning Commission determines that reduced spacing will not impair public
safety or the management of traffic on abutting roadways.  In granting this
exception, the Planning Commission may require the property owner to enter into
a recorded agreement with the City that preexisting access points to the site
will be closed and eliminated after the completion of a joint access driveway
with an adjacent parcel.
      (4)   Adjacent nonresidential properties that generate 100 trips or more
per day according to the Institute of Transportation Engineer's Trip Generation
Manual, shall provide a cross access drive to allow circulation between sites. 
The Planning Commission, upon the recommendation from the City Engineer, may
modify or waive the requirements of this sub-section where the characteristics
or layout of abutting properties would make development of a unified or shared
access and circulation system impractical.
      (5)   A system of joint use driveways and cross access easements shall be
established along all streets designated as collector or greater and the
building site shall incorporate one or more of the following:
         A.   Service drive connections or cross access corridors between sites
preferably visible from the street; a design speed of 10 miles per hour and
sufficient width to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed to accommodate
automobiles, service vehicles, and loading vehicles;
         B.   Stub-outs and other design features to show that the abutting
properties may be tied in to provide cross access via a service drive; or
         C.   A unified access and circulation system plan that includes
coordinated or shared parking areas is provided.
      (6)   To effectuate Paragraphs A through C a cross-access agreement shall
be required in accordance with Section
1125.07(e). 
      (7)   The Planning Commission, upon the recommendation from the City
Engineer, may modify or waive the requirements of this subsection where the
characteristics or layout of abutting properties would make development of a
unified or shared access and circulation system impractical.
   (c)   Traffic Impact Studies.
      (1)   A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be required whenever a Major
Subdivision or Development Plan application meets any of the development
intensity thresholds listed below.  The Planning Commission may waive this
requirement based on a recommendation from the City Engineer.
         A.   Generates or has the potential to generate traffic volumes equal
to or exceeding 100 vehicle trip ends (total of entering and exiting vehicles
for the proposed development at full 20-year build out and occupancy) during
the highest peak hour of the development or land use;
         B.   A turn-lane warrant analysis may be required by a development or
land use generating less than 100 vehicle trip ends in the peak hour; or
         C.   Proposed access within a location identified by the City Engineer
as a safety problem or accident location.
      (2)   The City Engineer shall maintain a list of submission requirements
for a TIS.
      (3)   The TIS shall outline recommended mitigation measures, including
but not limited to roadway widening, turn lane geometries, changes to
signalization, elimination or combination of access points, or reduction in the
proposed intensity of use, demonstrate any changes to the level of service
achieved by these measures, and describe any alternatives or suggested phasing
of improvements.  The responsibility for construction and timing of roadway
improvements shall be described.
   (d)   Turn Lanes.  Turn lanes shall be provided on all existing arterial and
collector streets adjacent to a proposed major subdivision. The Planning
Commission may waive this requirement based on a recommendation from the City
Engineer.

            (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1127.07  MEASUREMENTS AND CALCULATIONS.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, window area, and building frontage:
   (a)   Sign Setback.  All required setbacks for signs shall be measured as
the distance in feet from the applicable lot line, or other stated point of
measurement, to the closest point on the sign structure.
   (b)   Sign Height.
      (1)   The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade (average grade at the base of the sign) to the
top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of
any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely undertaken for the purpose
of locating or increasing the height of the sign.
      (2)   In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level,
sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the
normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest
point of the crown of a public or private street.
   (c)   Sign Area.  The surface of a sign to be included when computing
maximum allowable square footage of sign area shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   When calculating street frontage, only the street frontage that
lies in the incorporated area of the City of Wooster shall be used in the
calculation.
      (2)   For sign copy mounted or painted on a background panel, cabinet, or
surface distinctively painted, textured, lighted, or constructed to serve as
the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by means of
the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that
encompasses the extreme limits of the background panel, cabinet, or surface.
See Figure
1127-A and Figure
1127-B.
      (3)   For sign copy where individual letters or elements are mounted or
painted on a building façade where there is no background panel, cabinet, or
surface distinctively painted, textured, lighted, or constructed to serve as
the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by means of
the combination of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or
combination thereof that encloses all the letters or elements associated with
the sign. See Figure
1127-C. In cases where there are multiple sign elements on the same surface,
the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to determine the outermost
boundaries of individual sign elements.
      (4)   The calculation of sign area shall not include any supporting
framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall unless such structural support
is determined to constitute an integral part of the sign design by means of
text or other commercial message, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
See Figure
1127-A.

      (5)   In the case of a three-dimensional sign where the sign faces are
not mounted back-to-back, the sign area shall be calculated by the smallest
square, rectangle or circle that encompasses the profile of the sign message. 
The profile used shall be the largest area of the sign message visible from any
one point. See Figure
1127-D.

      (6)   Except for three-dimensional signs, the sign area for a sign with
more than one face (multi-faced signs) shall be computed by adding together the
area of all sign faces when the interior angle is greater than 30 degrees.
      (7)   When two identical, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back or at
angles of 30 degrees or less, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one
point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign
structure and are not more than 12 inches apart, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the faces. If the two faces are unequal,
the sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two faces.
   (d)   Determining Building Frontage, Building Units, and Building Facades.
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, the length of the building wall
that faces a public street, that faces a parking lot owned or operated by the
City of Wooster, or that contains a public entrance to the uses therein shall
be considered the building frontage or building facade. 
      (2)   The calculation of the width or lineal measurement of any façade
shall be the measurement of the façade between two side facades. The
calculation shall be based on viewing the façade from a 90-degree angle (i.e.,
straight on), regardless of façade insets, offsets, or angles. See Figure
1127-E.

      (3)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased by a single occupant or tenant shall be considered a building unit. 
The building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline
of the party walls defining the building unit.
      (4)   The primary facade shall be the portion of a frontage that serves
as the main access point to a building or building unit. A site or building
will be considered to have secondary facade when any of the following site/
building characteristics are present:
         A.   The subject site is a corner lot;
         B.   The primary parking area is not located adjacent to a public
street; or
         C.   The building or unit has walls with public ingress and egress
that do not face the public street.
      (5)   When a site has primary and secondary facade as defined herein, the
Zoning Administrator shall determine which wall shall be the primary building
facade and which wall(s) shall be the secondary building facade.  Only one
outside wall of any business shall be considered its primary facade.
   (e)   Determining Window Area.  The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage.  For the purposes of
determining window area for ground floor occupants, the ground floor shall be
considered to be no more than 15 feet in height above grade. See Figure
1127-F.

the provisions this code and any other applicable codes, ordinances, and
engineering documents of the City.
   (b)   Drawings and specifications for public improvements shall be reviewed

Engineer's continuous inspection. The installation of all public improvements
required by this code shall be completed in accordance with such drawings and
specifications.
   (c)   Agreements to install such improvements shall be approved concurrent
with the Planning Commission's approval of the final plat or the approval of a
final development plan. See Section
1105.07.
   (d)   At the completion of construction, and before acceptance of the public
improvements, the developer shall furnish the City a set of record or "as-
built" reproducible drawings as well as a digital copy that is compatible with
the City Engineer's CAD software showing the locations of all public
improvements including the sizes and elevations of all underground utilities. 
   (e)   The improvements required are determined according to the
accessibility of a sewer system and a public water supply, stormwater runoff,
drainage requirements, the relationship to existing or planned streets, the
type and size of lots required by this code for the applicable zoning district
in which the subdivision or development is located, and any other applicable
site development issues that fall under the category of public improvements.
For improvements within a subdivision, multi-family development, or
nonresidential development:
      (1)   Land for rights-of-way for all local streets within the subdivision
or development and for all secondary or major streets within or along the
boundary of the subdivision or development shall be dedicated by the developer
and all easements shall be provided. See Chapter
1125: Parking, Access, and Mobility.
      (2)   Utilities shall be furnished and installed as hereinafter required
and they shall be of such sizes and capacities as are required for the proposed
development or subdivision.
   (f)   Off-Site Improvements.
      (1)   Where the construction, improvement, development, or subdivision of
land makes necessary, at least in part, the installation of new or improved
sewerage, water, or drainage facilities located outside the property limits of
the development, the developer shall pay a proportionate share of the cost of
the facilities, in accordance with this sub-section.
      (2)   No such payment shall be required until the City Council has
established, or has committed itself by ordinance, to the establishment of a
general sanitary sewer, water or drainage improvement program for an area
having related and common sanitary sewer, water and drainage conditions, or any
of them, and within which the land to be developed is located.  The City may
develop and administer all three programs together or any one, or other number,
separately or jointly.
      (3)   The program shall include regulations that establish reasonable
standards to determine the proportionate share of the total estimated cost of
ultimate sanitary sewerage, water and drainage facilities required adequately
to serve a related and common area, when and if fully developed in accord with
the comprehensive plan, that shall be borne by each developer within the area.
      (4)   The share to be borne by each developer shall be limited to the
proportion of such total estimated cost which the increased sanitary sewerage
flow, water use or increased volume and velocity of stormwater runoff to be
caused by the proposed development bears to the total estimated volume and
velocity of such sanitary sewerage, water or runoff from such area in its fully
developed state.  In calculating the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff,
the City shall take into account the effect of all on-site stormwater
facilities or best management practices constructed or required to be
constructed by the developer and give appropriate credit therefore.
      (5)   Each such payment received shall be expended only for the necessary
engineering and related studies and the construction of those facilities for
which the payment was required and, until so expended, shall be held in an
interest-bearing account for the benefit of the developer.  In lieu of such
payment, the City Engineer may accept a letter of credit satisfactory to the
City Engineer conditioned upon the payment at the commencement of
construction.  The payments received shall be kept in a separate account for
each of the individual improvement programs until such time as they are
expended for the improvement program.  All payments shall be released and used,
with any interest earned, as a tax credit on the real estate taxes on the
property if construction of the facilities identified in the established water,
sewer and drainage programs is not commenced within twelve years from the date
of the posting of the payment.
      (6)   Nothing in this section shall imply or constitute an obligation on
the part of the City to upgrade or construct any sanitary sewerage, water or
storm drainage facilities or prevent the developer from constructing on his own
account and to satisfy his own schedule such off-site facilities necessary or
desirable for the safe and proper provision of utility service to the
development in accordance with this subdivision ordinance and other ordinances
of the City. 
   (g)   Financial Guarantees for Public Improvements.
      (1)   The subdivider or developer shall execute financial guarantees and
shall file such financial guarantees with the City prior to approval of a
development plan or certification of a final plat, if the applicant does not
propose to construct the required public improvements or private streets prior
to receiving certification of the final plat or approval of the development
plan. Such financial guarantee shall take any form allowed in Section
1129.04(g).
      (2)   The financial guarantee shall be an obligation for the faithful
performance of any and all work and the construction and installation of all
public improvements required to be done by the subdivider, together with all
engineering and inspection costs and fees incurred by the City.
      (3)   Guaranteed Amount.
         A.   The financial guarantees shall be in an amount equal to the
estimated total costs of materials and labor required to install or construct
the improvements. The City Engineer shall determine such costs. When any
portion of the improvements has, upon inspection, been found satisfactorily
completed, a reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal of funds equal to the
estimated costs of such completed improvements may be authorized.
         B.   Where applicable, engineering, plan review, and construction
review fees, etc., shall be required to be a part of the engineer's cost
estimate.
         C.   After a period of two years from the date of submittal, the City
Engineer may require that a revised engineer's estimate and bond be submitted
that reflects updated unit prices.
      (4)   The terms of such financial guarantees shall be determined by the
Law Director, with confirmation by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Subdivision Agreements.
         A.   Where the subdivider chooses to post a financial guarantee in
lieu of completion of those public improvements shown on the approved
engineering plan and/or final plat in order to allow for the recordation of the
final prior to completion and acceptance of all required public improvements,
the subdivider shall be required to enter into a subdivision agreement.
         B.   The subdivision agreement shall be approved as to content and
form by the City's Law Department, with confirmation by the City Engineer,
prior to approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission. The City shall
provide to the subdivider a sample subdivision agreement during review of the
final plat.
         C.   When an applicant for a development plan is required by this code
to construct the improvements shown on an approved development plan, the
applicant shall enter into an agreement, approved as to content and form by the
City's Law Department, with the City prior to approval of the development plan.
      (6)   The financial guarantee and subdivision agreement shall contain the
further condition that should one of the following conditions exist, the City
may, at its option, cause all required work to be done and public improvements
constructed by using the financial guarantee. 
         A.   The installation of all required public improvements as called
for in these regulations has not taken place within the time period agreed on
in the subdivision agreement with the City, and the subdivider has failed to
establish reasonable cause for such delay to the satisfaction of the City
Council and thereby to receive a time extension; and/or
         B.   The subdivider has not constructed the required public
improvements in accordance with the minimum standards specified by these
regulations, and the subdivider is unwilling to modify and upgrade said public
improvements within a six-month time period of notice so as to be in compliance
with the provisions of these regulations.
      (7)   The parties executing the financial guarantee shall be firmly bound
for the payment of all necessary costs therefor.
      (8)   Unit prices used in the engineer's cost estimate shall be based
upon unit costs associated with public contracting (i.e., prevailing wage
rates).
      (9)   Financial guarantees shall be made payable to the City of Wooster
and be acceptable to the City Engineer and the Law Director.
      (10)   Incomplete public improvements that the City Engineer determines
will constitute a safety hazard or maintenance issue, or will prevent the
effective functioning of the public improvements, shall be required to be
completed prior to the approval of a final plat.
      (11)   Street, Utility, and Improvements Maintenance.  The developer
shall guarantee the construction and materials of the street, utilities, and
public improvements for a two-year period after acceptance by the City. In
order to secure the guarantee, the developer shall deposit an amount equal to
50% of the total cost of the construction of the streets, utilities, and public
improvements as determined by the City Engineer. The deposit shall be in the
form of a financial guarantee as allowed in Section
1129.04(g).
      (12)   Types of Financial Guarantees.  The following are the types of
financial guarantees allowed by the City. The standards for each type of
guarantee shall apply to any situation where a financial guarantee is required,

            i.   The subdivider shall provide a certified check, wire transfer,
escrow to a third-party escrow account, or cash deposit for the amount of the
guarantee, payable to the City of Wooster.
            ii.   If a third-party escrow account is to be established, the
account shall be with a bank approved by the Law Director and shall be in an
account set up for the sole ownership of the City.
            iii.   When the public improvements are complete, the City shall
issue a check for the released amount based on this subsection.

the City against and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability, and
expense on account of damage to property of, or injury to or death of, the
parties or a third person caused by or in any way whatsoever attributable to
the construction of the improvements and the use of streets delineated on a
subdivision plat/plan or a development plan during construction. The developer
shall further agree, but without limiting its liability to indemnify the City,
to carry liability insurance contracts in an amount determined by the City for
injury to or death of persons, and for damage to or destruction of property,
which insurance contracts shall include the City as a named insured. The

that such insurance contracts are in force.
   (i)   Protection of Streets, Utilities, and Other Installations.
      (1)   The subdivider shall provide the City Engineer with a plan for the
routing of construction equipment and traffic with the objective of alleviating
any need to traverse adjacent off-site residential streets. In exceptional
cases, where no reasonable alternative exists or can be provided, construction
equipment may be permitted the use of collector streets for a predetermined
time period. The contractor shall be permitted to operate only pneumatic-tired
equipment over any paved street surfaces and shall be responsible for
correction of any damage to street surfaces in any manner resulting from the
contractor's operation.  During the period of use, such streets shall be kept
reasonably free of debris, based on periodic inspections by the City and in
accordance with approved sedimentation and erosion control measures.
      (2)   The subdivider and their contractors shall protect the pavement
against all damage prior to final acceptance of the work including damage
created by the contractor's construction equipment and vehicles, as well as
general traffic.  As soon as curing and sealing are completed, the contractor

control devices for the proposed development, including, but not limited to,
traffic signals, signs, pavement markings and the like.  Refer to the Ohio
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (OMUTC) for details of the devices to
be used, and, in some cases, warrants for their use.
   (b)   Debris and Waste.  No cut trees, diseased trees, timber, debris,
earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or other waste materials of any kind
shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the
time of the zoning compliance inspection. No items and materials as described
in the preceding sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of dedication of public improvements.
   (c)   Suitability of Land for Development.  If the Planning Commission and
the City Council find that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for
subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage, topography or
inadequate water supply, wastewater treatment facilities, transportation
facilities, or such other conditions as may endanger health, life or property,
and if, from investigations conducted by the public agencies concerned, it is
determined that, in the best interest of the public, the land should not be
developed for the subdivision proposed, the Planning Commission and the City
Council shall not approve the land for the purpose unless adequate methods are
advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by the
development of the land.
   (d)   Topography, Natural Vegetation, and Flooding.
      (1)   Natural amenities (including views, mature trees, creeks, riparian
corridors, rock outcrops, and similar features) shall be preserved and
incorporated into proposed development to the greatest extent feasible.
      (2)   The natural topography shall be retained wherever possible in order
to reduce excessive runoff onto adjoining property and to avoid extensive
regrading of the site.
      (3)   Floor elevations of all buildings shall be carefully studied in
relation to existing topography, proposed street grades, existing trees and
other pertinent site features.
      (4)   The subdivision shall be designed to minimize development in any
floodplain or floodway as defined by FEMA. The platting of lots for residential
occupancy in a 100-year floodplain shall be discouraged unless the subdivider
can document that any habitable structure shall be located outside the 100-year
floodplain.
   (e)   Homeowners' or Property Owners' Associations.  See Section
1121.06 for requirements for homeowners' or property owners' associations.
   (f)   Subdivision Names.  The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the City or Wayne County.  The City shall have final authority
to designate the name of the subdivision.
   (g)   Street Trees.  Street trees shall be provided in accordance with
Section
1123.04.
   (h)   Street Lights.
      (1)   The developer shall indicate on his plans where electric street
lighting service shall be installed in the development.  The developer shall
provide streetlights in all major subdivision, and the electric services shall
be underground.  The developer shall submit two sets of preconstruction
drawings to the electric utility company, who shall return one copy of their
street lighting recommendations to the City Engineer prior to final acceptance
of the preconstruction drawings for the development by the Engineer.
      (2)   The developer shall bear the cost of trenching and any special
backfilling required for the installation of streetlights.  Underground
conduits for streetlights shall be installed at the same time the street is
constructed, and shall be installed according to the plans developed by the
electric utility company.  The developer shall be responsible for furnishing
the required easements and such easements shall be shown on the final plat.
      (3)   In addition, the developer shall bear the cost difference between a
normal street light installation and shall bear the cost difference of
operating the more aesthetic installation for a period of twenty-two years. 
Such cost differences shall be paid in an advance lump sum payment according to
the schedule on file in the City Engineer's office.
   (i)   Monuments and Markers.
      (1)   A complete survey shall be made by a registered surveyor.
      (2)   When necessary in accordance with the accepted surveying practice
and legal requirements the surveyor shall set boundary monuments so that, upon
completion of the survey, each corner of the property and each referenced
control station shall be physically monumented.
      (3)   When it is impossible or impracticable to set a boundary monument
on a corner, the surveyor shall set a reference monument, similar in character
to the boundary monument and preferably along one of the property lines which
intersect at that corner.  When such a reference monument is used, it shall be
clearly identified as a reference monument on the plat of the property and in
any new deed description that may be written for the property.
      (4)   Every boundary monument and/or reference monument set by the
surveyor shall, when practicable:
         A.   Be composed of a durable material;
         B.   Have a minimum length of 30 inches;
         C.   Have a minimum crosssection area of material of 0.2 square
inches;
         D.   Be identified with a durable marker bearing the surveyor's Ohio
registration number and/or name or company name; and
         E.   Be detectable with conventional instruments for finding ferrous
or magnetic objects.
      (5)   When a case arises, due to physical obstructions such as pavements,
large rocks, large roots, utility cables, etc., so that neither a boundary
monument or a reference monument can be conveniently or practicably set in
accordance with Subsection
1129.05(i)(4) hereof, then alternative monumentation which is essentially as
durable and identifiable (i.e., chiseled "X" in concrete, drill hole, etc.)
shall be established for the particular situation.
      (6)   Per the City of Wooster Engineering Construction Standards, current
edition, monuments shall be located at all intersections and changes in street
alignment as well as whenever designated by the City Engineer.
   (j)   Maintenance and Operations.
      (1)   Where the development contains sewers, sewage treatment plants,
water supply systems, stormwater management facilities or other physical
features necessary or desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of
common use or benefit and which are of such character that the City or other
public agency does not desire to maintain them, such facilities shall be
maintained by a the property owner, the homeowners' association or an
equivalent agency. Documents creating an association and detailing maintenance
responsibilities shall be submitted in a form that is acceptable to the Law
Director for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such
facilities.
      (2)   In the event the property owner, agency, or homeowners' or owners'
association, hereafter referred to as the agency, established to own and
maintain the facilities, or any successor agency, shall fail to fulfill any
obligation imposed on such agency as a condition of approval of the
development, the City may serve written notice upon such agency or upon the
residents and owners of the development, setting forth the manner in which the
agency has failed to fulfill its obligation.  The notice shall include a demand
that such deficiencies be cured within the time specified within the notice. 
If such deficiencies are not cured within the specified time, the City, in
order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the development
and to prevent the facilities from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon
the facilities and maintain the same and perform the other duties of the agency
until such agency shall again resume its obligations.  All costs incurred by
the City in carrying out the obligations of the agency shall be assessed
against the properties within the development and shall become a tax lien on
the properties. 
         (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1129.06  LOT AND BLOCK DESIGN.
   (a)   Lots.  The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of
lots.
      (1)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites that can accommodate a structure and
required setbacks in the applicable zoning district. The lots shall be more or
less rectangular in form; triangular, elongated, or other shapes that restrict
its use as a building site shall be avoided to the maximum extent feasible.
      (2)   All lots shall conform to, or exceed, the requirements of the site
development standards for the applicable zoning district.
      (3)   In case of unusual soil conditions or other factors which may
impair the health and safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may be
located, upon the recommendation of the appropriate Board of Health or the City
Engineer, the Planning Commission may require larger lot widths and sizes, as
deemed necessary.
      (4)   No lot shall have an average depth that is more than two and one-
half times its average width. Where extraordinary and unnecessary hardship may
result from strict compliance with this regulation, the Zoning Administrator,
in consultation with the City Engineer, may vary this requirement.
      (5)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines except where the Planning Commission determines
that a variation to this rule will provide a better street and sublot layout.
      (6)   Lot lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum
radius of 25 feet.
      (7)   On curved streets the arc of the front lot line or a rear lot line
shall be not less than 60 percent of the required width at the building line.
      (8)   Every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a
reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for
all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use.
      (9)   Each lot shall front on an improved, dedicated street. Lots may
abut a private street in accordance with Section
1129.07.
      (10)   Typically, panhandle lots or through lots shall be discouraged and
may only be approved if necessitated by unique features or other special
physical conditions as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission. These lots
shall meet the requirements established for the applicable lot type in Section
1115.01(d).
      (11)   Through lots abutting an arterial street and fronting on a local
street within a subdivision shall be of sufficient depth so as to provide for a
minimum rear setback of 70 feet.  Within this setback, a 20-foot buffer strip
shall be reserved abutting the arterial street for the planting of screening. 
This screening shall include dense vegetative plantings incorporating trees
and/or shrubs of a variety which shall be equally effective in winter and
summer.  Trees and/or shrubs shall be adequately spaced to form a solid,
continuous visual screen within three years after the initial installation.  At
a minimum, at the time of planting, the spacing of trees shall not exceed 12
feet on center, and the planting pattern shall be staggered.  Shrubbery shall
be more closely spaced.
      (12)   For subdivisions located within three miles of the corporate
limits of the City, the developer or subdivider shall comply with the criteria
listed in Table
1129-1.  Except in case of unusual soil conditions or other factors which may
impair the health and safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may be
located, upon the recommendation of the appropriate Board of Health or the City
Engineer, the Planning Commission may require larger lot widths and sizes, as
deemed necessary.

Industrial                       200 feet         2 acres
NOTE:
[1] These regulations are based on the provision of group water and/or
sewer facilities.  If proposed subdivisions are based on individual water
and/or sewer facilities, the minimum lot size shall be that which will be
approved by the appropriate Board of Health for individual water and/or
sewer facilities except that in no case shall lots be smaller for
subdivisions located within three (3) miles of the corporate limits of
the City that are permitted in Table 1191.04.
      (13)   Setbacks Outside of the City of Wooster's Corporation Boundary. 
Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control and is to be used for
residential purposes, the average front building setback shall not be less than
30 feet from the right of way of the street or thoroughfare upon which the lots
front.  Restrictions requiring greater setbacks than the above may be required
for commercial and industrial uses and for residential uses along arterial and
collector streets as determined by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Blocks.  The following regulations shall govern the design and layout
of blocks.
      (1)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria set forth in Section
1129.07 and shall be arranged to accommodate lots and building sites of the
size and character required for the zoning district as set forth in this code.
      (2)   When a parcel is too small to be laid out economically for the use
intended and would result in fractional or odd shaped lots, the Commission may
request the developer to include adjoining unsubdivided land so a complete
block may be planned and developed as a unit.
      (3)   Subdivisions for single-family residential uses shall be designed
with blocks of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots of appropriate
depth, except where an interior street parallels a limited access highway,
arterial street, or railroad right-of-way. Such blocks shall have a minimum
length of 800 feet and a maximum length of 1,500 feet. In reviewing the
subdivision plat, the Planning Commission can modify these requirements for
blocks that will be located adjacent to nonresidential uses or where there are
unusual topographic or natural features.
      (4)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sac or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved if
properly designed and located and if the maintenance of interior public spaces
is covered by agreements.
      (5)   Blocks that will contain multi-family dwellings or nonresidential
uses shall be adequate to accommodate the building sites and provide the yards,
setbacks, service drives, off-street parking and other required facilities, and
shall be designed for unit development and not necessarily according to the
typical lot and street pattern.
      (6)   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length or at the end of a cul-de-
sac, pedestrian ways having a minimum right-of-way or easement of 30 feet shall
be required for access to schools, playgrounds or bus stops, or to other public
facilities where convenient pedestrian circulation has not been provided by
sidewalks and or streets.  The Planning Commission may eliminate or lessen the
requirements of this subsection based on the following: the existing sidewalk
network in the area; topographic and/or other natural constraints; and other
similar circumstances. 
         (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1129.07  STREETS AND THOROUGHFARES.
   (a)   General Street Design.
      (1)   The arrangement, character, width, grade, construction and location
of all streets shall conform to the comprehensive plan, or other applicable
street plans, for the City that are in effect at the time of final plat
submission.
      (2)   Such design elements shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, topographical conditions and public convenience
and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land
to be served by such streets. 
      (3)   The street layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of
land within the subdivision.
      (4)   When a proposed development is adjacent to or contains a State
highway, the developer and the Planning Commission should seek information from
the Ohio Department of Transportation as to the status of such highway in
reference to width and direction and also to access of such highway.
      (5)   Access control at major arterials and highways shall be taken into
consideration in the design of the subdivision plat. The City or ODOT has the
right to define and limit access along major arterials or highways.
      (6)   The subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the
subdivision plat the necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance or
alignment of such streets in conformity with the comprehensive plan or other
applicable street plans.
      (7)   Where practical, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining
areas.
      (8)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided or developed, the
arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper
projection of streets (i.e., provide for temporary dead-end streets where
street connections can be made to the adjacent land) as required by the City
Engineer.
      (9)   New subdivisions shall be based on a grid or modified grid system
to the maximum extent feasible.
      (10)   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography:
         A.   A subdivision/development shall be planned so that as many lots
as possible will be above the street grade.
         B.   On irregular topography, streets shall be designed to avoid
extensive cuts and fills and to comply with grading standards hereinafter
established for streets.
         C.   Streets approximately parallel to contour lines shall be adjusted
so that the lots on one side of the street will not be excessively below the
street grade.
         D.   Street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the
original topography. 
      (11)   A street that is not constructed to City standards will not be
accepted by the City for dedication as a public street.
      (12)   Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision which
would be subject to flooding.  All streets must be located at elevations which
will make them flood-free, in order that no portion of the subdivision would
become isolated by floods. 
      (13)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through
traffic that may otherwise use collector or arterial streets and whose origin
and destination are not within the subdivision.  However, offset streets should
be avoided.  Residential streets extending for a considerable distance,
parallel to any collector or arterial street, should be avoided.
      (14)   Dedicated streets for multi-family developments shall be planned
to connect with arterial or collector streets so as not to generate large
volumes of traffic on local residential streets.
      (15)   Dedicated streets for commercial and industrial developments shall
be planned to connect with arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on
local residential streets.  The Planning Commission may require the dedication
and improvement of service roads along arterial streets.
      (16)   In the interest of public safety, and as a matter of policy, all
points of ingress and egress shall be located as far as possible from the
intersection of two or more major arterial streets or highways.
   (b)   Street Names, Signs, and Numbering.
      (1)   Street names shall be selected that will not duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets in the City of Wooster and in Wayne
County irrespective of modifying terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc. 
Streets that are or will eventually be continuations of existing or platted
streets shall be named the same.  Street names shall be included on the
preliminary plan and final plat.
      (2)   When a new street is a direct extension of an existing street, the
name shall remain the same. 
      (3)   The developer, at his/her expense, shall install traffic control
devices within the subdivision and where subdivision streets connect with
existing streets in accordance with the recommendations of the traffic impact
study.  These devices shall meet all applicable standards in the City of
Wooster Engineering Construction Standards, current edition. 
      (4)   Address numbers shall be assigned by the City in accordance with
the current numbering system.
   (c)   Street Classification.  Each public street in a proposed development
shall be classified as an arterial, collector, or local street.  In classifying
streets, the City shall consider projected traffic demands after the completion
of the entire development.  Streets shall be designed according to the
following:
      (1)   Arterial Street.  Arterial streets shall not bisect residential
neighborhoods but act as boundaries between them.  Abutting residential
properties shall not face on the roadway unless separated from it by a service
road.  Access onto arterial streets shall be limited pursuant to the standards
in the State of Ohio Department of Transportation State Highway Access
Management Manual, current edition and the City of Wooster Engineering
Standards.  On-street parking shall be prohibited and traffic regulation shall
be accomplished by traffic control devices and channelization.
      (2)   Collector Street.  A collector street shall be permitted to have
direct, managed access to abutting properties.  Regulation of traffic between a
collector street and other street types shall be accomplished by traffic
control devices.  On-street parking may be permitted.
      (3)   Local Streets. Direct access to abutting properties shall be
permitted from local streets.  On-street parking may be permitted.
   (d)   Level of Service Requirements.  No development shall be approved if
such development, at ultimate build out, will result in or increase traffic on
the arterial or collector street to which it is connected, so that the arterial
or collector street functions at an average daily traffic Level of Service
(LOS) "D" or worse as described in the Highway Capacity Manual" prepared by the
Transportation Research Board.  The applicant shall mitigate the impacts from
the proposed development to ensure adequate roadway capacity at an average
daily traffic LOS "C" or better.
   (e)   General Street and Right-of-Way Design Standards.
      (1)   All public streets shall be constructed in accordance with
Engineering Construction Standards, current edition, except where the City
Engineer determines that a higher standard is warranted due to unusual
conditions.
      (2)   Minimum Street Right-Of-Way, Pavement Widths, and Curb/Gutters.
         A.   The minimum right-of-way and pavement width of public streets
shall conform to the width designated in Table
1129-2.  The Planning Commission in their review of the proposed subdivision or
development plan may vary this width when an increased width is recommended in
the Comprehensive Plan, or necessary to accommodate a boulevard, or a reduced
width is permitted for a Cluster Residential Development.
         B.   Right-of-way widths for public streets in Planned Developments
shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission, with review and
recommendation from the City Engineer.  The Planning Commission shall use these
standards as a guide for determining the appropriate width.
         C.   Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided or to the proposed site for development,
the applicant shall dedicate by subdivision plat additional right-of-way so
that such streets will have a minimum right-of-way width shown in Table
1129-2 or that shown on the Thoroughfare Plan.
         D.   If the existing rights-of-way within a subdivision are not as
specified in Table
1129-2 below, the subdivider shall dedicate additional right-of-way by
subdivision plat so that such streets will meet the standards of this chapter.
         E.   Portland cement curbs and gutters or vertical curbs, conforming
to the specifications of the City Engineer, shall be provided on both sides of
all streets within the corporation limits, provided that the Planning
Commission may waive curb requirements within the three-mile area of
jurisdiction beyond the corporation limits, in a Cluster Residential, and in a
Planned Development, if a subdivision modification is approved in accordance
with Section
1105.06(h).
         F.   The subdivider shall be responsible for establishing the minimum
right-of-way width and installing the pavement width (measured from back of
curb to back of curb) required in Table
1129-2 below, at the subdivider's expense.
 
TABLE 1129-2: MINIMUM PAVEMENT AND RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTHS FOR PUBLIC STREETS
Street Type                      Right of Way Width Pavement Width [1]
Arterial, and highways           Variable [1]       Variable [2]
Collector                        80 feet            37 feet
Local - Residential              60 feet            27 feet
Local - Commercial or Industrial 80 feet            37 feet
NOTES:
[1] See also Subsection (G) below for additional width requirements for on-
street parking.
[2] Shall conform to applicable cross sections of the Engineering
Construction Standards, as determined by the City Planning Commission and the
City Engineer.
 
         G.   A parking lane at least eight feet wide on one or both sides of
the street and paved in accordance with the current specifications may be
required by the City Engineer, and such requirement may be in addition to the
necessary number of lanes for moving traffic.
      (3)   Street Intersections.
         A.   The angle of intersection between local streets and arterial
streets should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle.  All other
streets should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible. 
Property line radius at intersections shall be not less than twenty-five feet.
         B.   Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point,
unless the City Engineer advises the Planning Commission that such an
intersection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.
         C.   Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a
street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite
side of such street.  In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at
an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets
shall be not less than 200 feet on local streets and 400 feet on collector and
arterial streets.
         D.   Street curb intersections shall be rounded by a minimum radius of
25 feet on local streets and a minimum radius of 35 feet on collector streets
and arterial streets.
         E.   Intersections of two local residential streets should be designed
to maintain suitable traffic volumes and speeds.
      (4)   Street Grades and Curvature.
         A.   Street grades shall not exceed the following percentages set
forth in Table
1129-3, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves.  The Planning
Commission may permit deviations from these requirements where the topography
is such that these standards are not practical:
 
TABLE 1129-3: MAXIMUM GRADE OF STREETS
Type of Street    Maximum Grade (percent)
Arterial Streets  5
Collector Streets 7
Local Streets     9
Cul-de-sacs       10
 
         B.   The minimum street grade shall be one percent in order to provide
adequate surface drainage.
         C.   In no case shall streets be constructed with grades that, in the
professional opinion of the City Engineer, create a substantial danger to the
public safety.
         D.   Streets shall level off to a grade not exceeding two percent for
a distance of not less than 50 feet from each side of an intersection.
      
   (f)   Special Street Types and Street Requirements.  The following
requirements shall apply to special street types or under the specified
circumstances:
      (1)   Dead-End Streets.
         A.   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted.
         B.   Where a subdivision adjoins un-subdivided land, a temporary turn-
around shall be provided for each street more than 200 feet in length if lots
front thereon, and provisions shall be made for future extension of the street
and utilities and reversion of the excess right-of-way to the abutting
properties and the same shall be so noted on the final plat. 
         C.   The temporary turn-around shall conform to the Engineering
Construction Standards, current edition.
      (2)   Cul-De-Sacs.
         A.   A cul-de-sac street shall have a maximum length of 1,000 feet
measured from the centerline of the nearest street intersection to the center
of the cul-de-sac turnaround.
         B.   For residential, local streets, each cul-de-sac shall be provided
with a turnaround having a minimum pavement radius of 45 feet measured from
face of curb and a minimum right of way radius of 60 feet.
         C.   The standards for streets in commercial and industrial
developments shall be determined, by consulting with the City Engineer and the
Planning Commission, at the time of preliminary plat review or during
development plan review.
      (3)   Alleys.
         A.   Alleys may be considered for residential subdivisions if the
design of the subdivision, the proposed type or character of development, and/
or the surrounding street layout will create a development that complies with
the comprehensive plan or enhances traffic movement. 
         B.   Alleys may be required in nonresidential districts if other
provisions cannot be made for adequate service access. 
         C.   The minimum widths for alleys shall be 20 feet for the right-of-
way and 18 feet for the pavement width.
      (4)   Half-Streets.  The dedication of new half-streets shall not be
permitted.  Where a dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the
tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by
the Planning Commission.
      (5)   Private Streets and Common Drives.
         A.   Private streets and common drives shall not be permitted except
as follows:
            i.   As permitted in Section
1109.03(c)(1); or
            ii.   As permitted in Chapter
1111: Planned Developments.
         B.   When the private street is 500 feet or less in length and only
serves to provide access to a multi-family development, provided such private
street shall not be planned or be expected to extend to serve property outside
the multi-family development and the design and layout of the private street(s)
shall provide adequate and safe access to the intended units, as determined by
the Wooster Police and Fire Departments.  Such private street shall be
constructed in accordance with Engineering Construction Standards, current
edition.
         C.   Whenever a private street is included in a Cluster Residential
Development or a Planned Development, deed restrictions shall be required which
shall specifically include the following language, "The undersigned grantee(s)
hereby acknowledge(s) that (he, she, they) understand that the premises
described herein is located upon a non- dedicated, private street.  And
further, the grantee(s) understands that no government body is responsible for
care and maintenance of said private street."

or common drive. And further, the grantee(s) understands that no government
body is responsible for care and maintenance of said common drive."
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1129.08  SIDEWALKS, WALKWAYS, TRAILS, AND BIKEWAYS.
   All subdivisions shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section
1125.09.
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1129.09  UTILITIES.
   (a)   General Requirements for Utilities and Underground Facilities.
      (1)   All public and common electric, cable, and telephone lines and
other utilities shall be located underground in all residential, office,
commercial and industrial subdivisions and districts, and shall be placed in
their own easement, shown on the final or record plat. These underground
utility requirements shall also apply to any lines required to serve the new
development that extend outside the boundary of the development. The conduits
or cables shall be located within easements or public rights-of-way in separate
trenches, in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services.
      (2)   Whenever public improvements are installed, the open cutting of
roads shall be avoided to the greatest extent practicable.
      (3)   Where cable, fiber optic, television, or similar services or
conduit is or will be in operation, the applicant shall install cable or
conduit for such service simultaneously with and in the same manner as electric
and telephone cables are installed, both within the right-of-way and to
individual building connections.
      (4)   All sewer and utility pipelines shall preferably be placed outside
the limits of the pavement. All excavations for public utilities made under
paved areas shall be properly backfilled with approved granular materials
thoroughly compacted in place and subject to approval by the City Engineer.
      (5)   All storm drainage grates shall be constructed to allow bicycles to
pass over the grate safely and shall have the words "No Dumping, Drains to
Stream", or similar, cast into the grate.
      (6)   Any plans or documents submitted for subdivision or development
plan approval shall conform to the City of Wooster's Development and
Improvement Regulations Manual, current edition. 
   (b)   Sanitary Sewers.
      (1)   Sanitary sewerage facilities shall connect with public sanitary
sewerage systems where available and adequate capacity exists. When sanitary
sewers are not available, as determined by the City Engineer, the City or
County Board of Health shall review lot sizes and shapes, topographic
conditions and soil conditions, and if appropriate Board of Health finds that
private wells and/or private sewage disposal systems will be acceptable
according to the rules and regulations of the City and County Board of Health
and the State of Ohio, the Planning Commission may, at their discretion,
approve private water supply and/or sewage disposal system provided that all
other requirements have been met.
      (2)   If public sanitary sewerage facilities are reasonably available to
serve the proposed subdivision or development, but inadequate capacity, as
determined by the City Engineer, in such facilities exists, the applicant shall
at his/her expense upgrade the sanitary sewerage lines or facilities to provide
the additional capacity.  The City Engineer shall evaluate the downstream sewer
system to the point where the flow contributed by the subdivision is less than
one percent of the flow in the system.
      (3)   In considering the availability of a public sewer, the City
Engineer shall consider the following criteria: the proximity of public sewer
lines; engineering feasibility and cost of extension of such lines to serve the
subdivision; appropriateness of the area and soils for septic sewer service;
public health and safety of the proposed subdivision; and the City's plans for
sewer line extension or service in the area.
      (4)   The sanitary sewerage plan shall include calculations of the amount
of sanitary flow to be discharged from the subdivision upon complete occupancy
of the site.
      (5)   Construction and Design of Sanitary Sewer.
         A.   Unless public sewer is determined not to be available, sanitary
sewers shall be constructed in accordance with the standards prescribed by the
City Engineer.  The minimum size shall be an eight-inch diameter, placed at a
minimum grade of 0.4%.
         B.   The sanitary sewer shall be designed and constructed so as to
serve by gravity the lowest floor elevation of proposed principal buildings on
all lots.
         C.   Public sewer shall be designed and constructed to be available to
each lot, such that individual laterals shall not extend across lots to the
served lot. 
   (c)   Water Supply.
      (1)   Public water, if available as determined by the City Engineer,
shall be extended at the developer's and/or owner's cost to all lots.  Where
the public water system is not available, the City or County Board of Health
shall review lot sizes and shapes, topographic conditions and soil conditions
for that particular subdivision, and if the appropriate Board of Health finds
that private wells will be acceptable according to the rules and regulations of
the City and Wayne County Board of Health and the State of Ohio, the Planning
Commission may, at their discretion, approve private water supply system
      (2)   In considering the availability of public water, the City Engineer
shall consider the following criteria:
         A.   The proximity of public waterlines;
         B.   Engineering feasibility and cost of extension of such lines to
serve the subdivision or development;
         C.   Alternative sources of water;
         D.   Public health and safety of the proposed development; and
         E.   The City's plans for waterline extension in the area; whether an
alternate source of water, acceptable to the fire department, is available or
will be provided for fire suppression purposes.
      (3)   If public water facilities are reasonably available to serve the
proposed subdivision or development, but inadequate capacity as determined by
the City Engineer exists, the applicant shall at his expense upgrade the
public  water mains or facilities to provide the additional capacity.  Adequate
capacity shall be determined as enabling 1,000 gallons per minute fire flow to
be attained at the critical hydrant as determined by the City Engineer, without
dropping residual pressures elsewhere within the public water system to or
below 20 pounds per square inch.
      (4)   Unless public water is determined not to be available, the
applicant shall install the public water distribution system within the
subdivision or development, including water mains, service lateral through the
curb line for each lot, and fire hydrants, and upon its completion, shall
dedicate and convey title to the water distribution system to the City of
Wooster.
      (5)   Construction and Design Standards.
         A.   Water lines shall be constructed in accordance with the standards
prescribed by the City Engineer, and shall be ductile iron. The minimum size
shall be a six-inch diameter. 
         B.   Fire hydrant placement shall be as specified in Part 15, Fire
Prevention Code, Section
1505.
         C.   Water mains shall be looped within or through a subdivision.
         D.   Water service line shall be located on a lot corner remote from
the electric service.
      (6)   Placement of Water Services.  When public water is designed and
constructed to be available to each lot, individual services shall not extend
across lots to the served lot.
   
   (d)   Storm Sewers and Stormwater Management.
      (1)   The design of stormwater runoff conveyance systems including, but
not limited to storm sewers and appurtenant structures, bridges, culverts,
ditches, swales, detention and/or retention facilities, shall meet the
requirements of The Erosion and Stormwater Runoff Control Manual for
Development and Improvement, current edition.
      (2)   Unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer, stormwater
management facilities, such as detention and retention ponds, shall not be
located on individually owned lots in a residential subdivision.  Instead,
these facilities shall be located on a lot or lots commonly owned by a
homeowner's association or equivalent agency.
      (3)   Stormwater management facilities serving a residential subdivision
shall be maintained by the homeowner's association or equivalent agency for
that subdivision as required in Section
1129.05(j), unless City maintenance or another arrangement is approved by the
City Engineer.  A maintenance plan for the facilities shall be provided as part
of the engineering plan for the subdivision, and maintenance responsibility
shall be designated on the subdivision plat.
      (4)   Detention/retention facilities that are visible from a public
street shall be integrated into a landscaped area. Such landscaped areas shall
contain any combination of the following elements: shade and ornamental trees,
evergreens, shrubbery, hedges, and/or other planting materials as well as
ornamental fencing.
   (e)   Other Utilities.
      (1)   Electrical service, gas mains and other utilities should be
provided within each subdivision.  Whenever such facilities are reasonably
accessible and available, they may be required to be installed within the area
prior to the approval of the final plat.
      (2)   Other Utilities, Electric, Telephone and Cable Television
Installation.  The installation, construction and expansion of electric,
telephone, cable television and other utilities shall be placed underground
subject to the following:
         A.   Transmission lines are exempt from the provisions of this
section. Transmission lines are defined as those lines that are part of the
transmission grid, constructed on towers between generating stations and
substations.
         B.   For the standard or typical underground utility installation,
that equipment typically placed above ground such as transformers and switches
affixed on the ground shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
         C.   For purposes of this section, services, adjacent to new
subdivisions as well as commercial and industrial uses, that shall be installed
underground include but are not be limited to:
            i.   New distribution lines that deliver local service and are
extended across the public right-of-way from existing overhead service to such
new subdivisions, commercial and industrial uses; and
            ii.   Existing overhead distribution lines that deliver local
service which are located within the public right-of-way that is being widened
or improved as part of the improvements for the proposed subdivision.
         D.   Temporary overhead services of electric and telephone utilities
shall be allowed, provided that all permanent electric, telephone and cable
television services within and adjacent to new subdivisions, commercial and
industrial uses shall be underground.  For the purposes of this section,
temporary overhead service shall mean:
            i.   That service which is necessary for immediate public
convenience and necessity and is constructed to serve only on an interim basis
until permanent underground services can be installed; and
            ii.   That service which in order to reach a new subdivision,
commercial or industrial use must be extended from existing overhead service
through undeveloped parcels of land not included in the subdivision, commercial
or industrial use.
         E.   The owner or developer of new subdivisions as well as commercial
and industrial uses shall offer an easement for TV cable and TV cable equipment
within the easement shown on the plat for electric and telephone utilities. 
The easement shall be granted at no expense to the TV cable operator.
         F.   The providers of electric, telephone, natural gas, and cable
television services are encouraged to inform the Planning Commission as to the
nature and location of their services and plans for increasing service
capacity.
            (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1129.10  EASEMENTS.
   (a)   The developer shall convey a 15-foot wide common or shared utility
easements centered on all interior lot lines and interior to all perimeter lot
lines, to franchised cable television operators furnishing cable television and
corporations furnishing cable television, gas, telephone, and electric service
to the development. 
   (b)   The subdivider shall provide easements for storm drainage purposes
which conform substantially to the lines of any natural watercourses, channels,
streams or creeks which traverse the subdivision, or for any new channel which
is established to substitute for a natural watercourse, channel, stream or
creek. 
   (c)   All underground public utility lines, wires, cables, conduits, vaults,
laterals, pipes, mains, valves and other similar distributing equipment shall
be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in such a manner so as not
to conflict with any other underground service previously installed.
   (d)   Easements may also be required across lots where engineering design or
special conditions may necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines
outside of public rights-of-way.
   (e)   The City Engineer may require a wider easement where necessary to
provide adequate separation between water, sewer, and/or stormwater management
facilities. 
   (f)   The City Engineer may waive the requirement for any of the above
easements when the proposed development does not include lots being
subdivided.

CHAPTER 1131
Nonconformities
1131.01   Purpose.
1131.02   General provisions.
1131.03   Determination of legal nonconformity status.
1131.04   Nonconforming uses and variances or administrative waivers.
1131.05   Nonconforming uses.
1131.06   Nonconforming structures and sites.
1131.07   Nonconforming lots of record.
1131.08   Nonconforming signs.
1131.09   Repair and maintenance.
   1131.01  PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this code, some lots, uses of lands or
structures, or combinations thereof may exist which were lawful prior to the
effective date or amendment of this code, but that are prohibited, regulated,
or restricted under the terms of this code. The legitimate interests of those
who lawfully established these nonconformities are herein recognized by
providing for the continuance of such uses, subject to regulations limiting
their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution.
Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this code that such nonconformities be
allowed to continue until removed, they should not be encouraged to survive,
unless otherwise allowed in this chapter or specifically addressed in this
code. 
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1131.02  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Any use, building, structure, land or premises that existed at the
time of the effective date of this code that was legally established under a
previous code amendment or versions may be continued even if such use,
building, structure, or use of land does not conform to the provisions of this
code.
   (b)   Passage of this code in no way legalizes any illegal uses existing at
the time of its adoption.
   (c)   An applicant for any development review procedure that deals with
nonconformity shall bear the burden of proof in demonstrating that the use was
a legal nonconformity on the effective date of this code.
   (d)   Violation of any conditions and/or safeguards prescribed in this
chapter shall be deemed a violation of this code and shall be punishable under
Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties. 
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1131.03  DETERMINATION OF LEGAL NONCONFORMITY STATUS.
   (a)   At the time of application for a zoning certificate, or request for
variance regarding a nonconforming lot, building, structure or use, the
property owner shall submit sufficient evidence for the Zoning Administrator or
BZA, as applicable, to determine that such lot, building, structure, or use was
lawfully created or established in accordance with the code regulations in
existence at that time.
   (b)   If the evidence submitted indicates the lot, building, structure or
use was legally established and has since become nonconforming because of the
establishment of, or amendment to, this code, the Zoning Administrator shall
issue a zoning certificate identifying it as a legal nonconformity.  A copy of
such certificate shall be kept on file in the offices of the Zoning
Administrator. 
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1131.04  NONCONFORMING USES AND VARIANCES OR ADMINISTRATIVE WAIVERS.
   (a)   Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use,
such use shall no longer be defined as a nonconforming use, nor shall the
property be returned to the former nonconforming use.
   (b)   When a property owner or authorized agent is granted approval of a
variance or administrative waiver for a nonconformity that addresses the
nonconformity, the use, structure, or lot shall no longer be considered
nonconforming. In no case shall the resolved nonconformity be expanded or
altered to create further nonconformities.
   (c)   If a property owner or authorized agent is granted approval of a
variance or administrative waiver for a nonconformity that addresses some
nonconformities but additional nonconformities continue, the use shall still be
subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1131.05  NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this code, lawful uses of land or
structures exist that would not be permitted by the regulations of this code,
the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful and provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this code unless it complies with the
provisions of Section
1131.05(e).
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this code.
   (c)   No additional structures shall be constructed on a lot with a
nonconforming use unless such new structure complies with the requirements of
this code and the applicable zoning district.
   (d)   Change or Substitution to Another Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   The lawful nonconforming use of an existing building, structure, or
lot can be continued even if such use is not permitted in the applicable
district.
      (2)   If no structural alterations are made that increase the
nonconformity, a nonconforming use of a building or structure, or a
nonconforming use of a lot, may be changed to another nonconforming use of the
same or of a more restricted use, as determined by the BZA. Such determination
shall be made at a public hearing held in the same manner as a variance (See
Section
1105.11.), including notice, but the variance review criteria of Section
1105.11(c) shall not apply. At the hearing, the BZA shall make a decision based
on the following findings:
         A.   That the use proposed is equally appropriate or more appropriate
to the district than the existing nonconforming use; and
         B.   That the use proposed is in less conflict with the character of
uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing
nonconforming use.
      (3)   In permitting such change, the BZA may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accordance with other provisions of this code and
when made a part of the terms under which the change is granted.
      (4)   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive
nonconforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive
nonconforming use.
      (5)   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a use permitted in the
district in which the lot is located, it shall cease to be considered a
nonconforming use. Upon such compliance, no nonconforming use shall be made,
resumed, or reinstated.
   (e)   Expansion or Alteration of a Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use of land shall not be physically enlarged,
increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied by
the use at the time it became nonconforming, unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   A nonconforming use of an existing structure may be extended
throughout any parts of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed
for such use at the time of adoption or amendment to this code. However, no
such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building not
previously occupied by such nonconforming use. 
      (3)   No such building shall be enlarged or expanded to increase the
nonconforming use. No additional structures shall be constructed in connection
with such nonconforming use, except as follows:
         A.   The construction of a detached accessory structure related to a
nonconforming residential use shall be permitted subject to complying with the
accessory use lot coverage & setback regulations of the zoning district in
which the nonconforming residential use is located. The maximum height of such
accessory structure shall not exceed 20 feet.
         B.   For nonconforming residential uses, non-habitable attached
garages, porches and decks, although requiring zoning clearance and a zoning
certificate, shall not be considered expansions of non-conforming uses. Such
additions to non-conforming residential uses shall comply with the lot coverage
& setback requirements of the zoning district in which the nonconforming
residential use is located. The maximum height of such addition shall not
exceed 35 feet.   
      (4)   No building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use shall be
altered, improved, or reconstructed except when the use is changed to a
permitted use in the district in which it is located, or upon prior approval of
the BZA provided the cumulative cost of the alteration, reconstruction, or
improvement permitted by the BZA does not exceed 50 percent of the building's
replacement value.       
   (f)   Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land.  A nonconforming use of land
shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel
other than those portions occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming.
   (g)   Removal of a Nonconforming Mobile or Manufactured Home Use of Land.  
A nonconforming use of land for a mobile or manufactured home shall be
voluntarily abandoned upon the removal of such mobile or manufactured home from
the site of such use.  Any subsequent use of the land shall conform to the use
regulations specified by this Code for the district in which such land is
located.
   (h)   Termination of Nonconforming Uses.
      (1)   Termination of Use through Discontinuance.
         A.   When any nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for more
than 12 consecutive months, such discontinuance shall constitute voluntary
abandonment and any new use shall conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located. Furthermore, a nonconforming use may not thereafter be
resumed. The intent to continue a nonconforming use shall not be evidence of
its continuance.
         B.   The BZA shall only consider applications to reinstate a
nonconforming use after the use has been discontinued or abandoned for more
than 12 months through an use variance review as established in Section
1105.11.
      (2)   Termination of Use by Damage or Destruction.
         A.   If a nonconforming single-family detached dwelling in any
district is damaged or destroyed to any extent, such structure and single-
family detached dwelling may be reestablished on the same lot provided it meets
the same size in height and footprint, as well as complying with the same
setbacks as previously existed. Such reestablishment of the use shall require
the issuance of a zoning certificate and shall be required to commence within
12 months of the damage or destruction.
         B.   If any nonconforming use beyond a single-family detached building
is damaged or destroyed, but not to an extent greater than 50 percent of the
principal structure's market value according to the Wayne County Auditor, such
structure and use may be reestablished on the same lot to the same size and
intensity of use, with the same number or fewer dwelling units, as was
previously existing immediately prior to the damage or destruction. Such
reestablishment of the use shall require the issuance of a zoning certificate
and shall be required to commence within 12 months of the damage or
destruction. If the proposed use or development requires a development plan
and/or a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with code, then such
approvals shall be required for any reconstruction.
         C.   If any nonconforming use beyond a single-family detached building
is damaged or destroyed to an extent greater than 50 percent of the principal
structure's market value according to the Wayne County Auditor, such structure
and use shall not be reestablished unless approved by the BZA through a use
variance review (See Section
1105.11.)
            (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1131.06  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND SITES.
   A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied by
a use permitted in the applicable zoning district so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Any nonconforming structure or site may be enlarged, maintained,
repaired, moved, or altered provided, however, no such enlargement,
maintenance, repair, move, or alteration shall either create an additional
nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or
any part of such structure or site, unless otherwise specified in this code.
   (b)   A nonconforming structure shall not be relocated in whole or in part
to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure
shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the applicable zoning district
after being relocated.
   (c)   The principal use of a nonconforming building may be changed to any
other use permitted in the applicable zoning district as long as the new use
complies with all regulations of this code specified for such use, except the
regulations to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (d)   The governmental acquisition of a portion of a lot for a public
purpose that results in reduction in a required yard or building setback below
that required in the applicable zoning district shall not render a structure
nonconforming.
   (e)   Damage or Destruction of a Nonconforming Structure Containing a
Conforming Use.
      (1)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged, but not to an extent
greater than 50 percent of the structure's market value, as determined by the
Wayne County Auditor, such structure and use may be reestablished on the same
lot to the same size and intensity of use as was previously existing
immediately prior to the damage or destruction. Such reestablishment of the use
shall require the issuance of a zoning certificate. If an owner rebuilds a
legally nonconforming structure under this provision, they may expand the
structure provided, as stated in Paragraph 1131.06(a), any expansion or change
does not increase the nonconformity that existed prior to the damage. Such
restoration shall be required to commence within 12 months of the damage or
destruction.
      (2)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged beyond 50 percent of the
structure's market value, such structure shall only be rebuilt in compliance
with the requirements of this code. Such reconstruction shall require the
application and issuance of all necessary zoning and building permits.
      (3)   If the owner voluntarily removes the structure or reduces the
nonconformity, that has not been damaged or destroyed, that owner shall not be
permitted to rebuild the structure to the original height, size, or setback.
   (f)   Nonconforming Site Conditions Existing at the Time of Development Plan
Review.  If a nonconforming site condition(s) exists when a revised development
plan is required pursuant to Section
1105.07, then such site condition(s) must be brought into compliance with
district regulations, unless the Planning Commission determines that such
conformance cannot be reasonably achieved because of existing site conditions.
In such case, the Planning Commission shall approve a development plan that
reduces the existing nonconforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent
practicable. 
      (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1131.07  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   A nonconforming lot of record may be used in accordance with this section.
   (a)   If an existing lot of record is occupied by conforming structures,
such structures shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized or altered,
provided that:
      (1)   The structure shall not be enlarged in floor area unless the
enlarged section complies with all regulations of this code, with the exception
of the lot area and the lot width regulations. 
      (2)   The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless in
conformance with this code.
   (b)   In any R-1, R-2, or R-T District, a single-family dwelling and its
customary accessory uses may be erected on a vacant single lot of record.
   (c)   A vacant nonconforming lot in all districts except the R-1, R-2, or R-
T District may be used for any use permitted in the district in which it is
located when the development of such lot meets all requirements of the district
in which it is located, including the maximum lot coverage and minimum setback
requirements, except for the minimum lot area and lot width requirements. No
use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for
a particular district shall be permitted on a nonconforming lot. Review and
approval of development on such lots of record shall be conducted according to
the development plan review requirements set forth in Section
1105.07.
   (d)   If a vacant nonconforming lot in any district adjoins one or more lots
in common ownership on the effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code, or
applicable amendment thereto, such lots shall be replatted to create conforming
lots as a prerequisite for development. 
      (Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-17-18.)
   1131.08  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   See Section
1127.12, for the regulation of nonconforming signs.
(Ord. 2018-009.  Passed 5-7-18.)
   1131.09  REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.

   1303.01  ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, and as identified and published in Division
4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
(Ord. 2005-35.  Passed 12-5-05.)
   1303.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
   1303.03  SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures.  No building or its equipment or accessories, to which the rules of
the Board of Building Standards apply shall be erected, constructed, or
installed, except in conformity with the rules of the Board.  Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, of any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction.  This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller.  (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;
   (f)   Buildings or structures which are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for

pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under “24 CFR Part 3280", “Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards”.
      (OBC 101.2)
   1303.04  COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No owner or any other person shall construct, erect, build or equip
any building or structure to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable, or
make any addition thereto or alteration thereof, except in case of repairs for
maintenance without affecting the construction, sanitation, safety or other
vital feature of such building or structure, without complying with this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building Code, or fail to
comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.
(ORC 3791.01, 3791.02)
   (b)   No architect, builder, engineer, plumber, carpenter, mason,
contractor, subcontractor, foreman or employee shall violate or assist in

(ORC 3791.01, 3791.03)
   (c)   No owner or any other person shall proceed with the construction,
erection, alteration or equipment of any building or structure to which the

(ORC 3791.04)
   
   (d)   The International Property Maintenance Code is hereby adopted for
maintenance of existing buildings, structures, premises and facilities for
other than one, two or three-family occupancies relating to public health,

alteration, repair, addition, and change of occupancy of any existing
structure.
   The occupancy of any structure currently existing on the date of adoption of
this Code shall be permitted to continue without change provided the alleged
occupancy can be shown to have existed for more than two years and there are no
orders of the Building Official pending, no evidence of fraud, or no serious
safety or sanitation hazard.
   Buildings constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved
prior to the effective date of this Code are existing buildings.
(OBC 102.6)
   1303.06  VIOLATIONS.

Code or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, by any remedy, civil or criminal,
it shall issue an adjudication order within the meaning of Sections 119.06 to
119.13 of the Ohio Revised Code or a stop work order as provided in Section
1303.07.  Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what
appliances, site preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans,
materials, assemblages or procedures are necessary for the same to comply with
Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Include notice to the party of the procedure for appeal and right
to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice.  The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he may be represented by
counsel, present his arguments or contentions orally or in writing and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure.  When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner’s agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board.  The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board.  Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation.  Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section
1303.07, the person receiving an order shall cease work upon the site
preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or shall cease using the
appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified in the
order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
   1303.061 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority.  Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto.  The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance.  The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent and the person
doing the work.  Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance.  Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition.  Failure to
cease work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public
nuisance.

and the Division.
(Ord.  1979-35.  Passed 9-4-79.)
   1303.08  CONFLICT.
   (a)   General.  Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.  Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws.  The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law.  The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.  However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio.  The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders
issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Chapter 3743, of the Ohio Revised Code
prevail in the event of a conflict.
(OBC 102)

   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the Board shall make such
investigations as it deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues and
determine whether it is probable that unlawful or discriminatory housing
practices have been or are being engaged in.  The investigation shall be
conducted within fifteen business days after the filing of the complaint,
although the investigation may be extended as deemed necessary by the
chairperson of the Board.  In no event shall any investigation be continued
more than ninety calendar days beyond the date of filing of the complaint.
   (c)   If the Board determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe a
violation has occurred or is occurring, it shall endeavor to eliminate such
practices by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion
involving all interested parties and their representatives.  Such efforts shall
be informal, and nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties thereto agree
in writing.
   (d)   If, after such investigation and conference, the Board is satisfied
that any unlawful or discriminatory housing practice has been eliminated, it
may treat the complaint as conciliated, and entry of such disposition shall be
made on the records of the Board.  The terms of conciliation agreed to by the
parties shall be reduced to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement
to be signed by the parties.  Consent agreements shall signed on behalf of the
Board by its chairperson.
   (e)   If the Board determines after preliminary investigation that it is not

provided, that the Board shall not dismiss such complaint without first
affording the complainant an opportunity to appear before the Board.  Upon
request of either party, the Board shall issue written findings of fact in
support of its decision.
   In conjunction with the dismissal of any complaint for lack of probable
cause, the Board shall inform the complainant in writing of his or her right to
file the complaint with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission or with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or to file an action in a
court of competent jurisdiction.
   (f)   If the Board fails to effect through conciliation the elimination of
such unlawful or discriminatory housing practices or to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, it shall issue and cause to be served upon any
person, including the person against whom the complaint is filed (hereafter
referred to as the respondent), a complaint stating the charges and containing
a summons and notice of the time and place of a hearing on the complaint.  Such
hearing shall be scheduled not less than fifteen nor more than thirty calendar
days after service of the complaint and summons.  The Director of Law shall

complaint.  Any complaint issued pursuant to this section shall be so issued

alleged unlawful or discriminatory practices.

affirmation.  The Board shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record
shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record at such cost to the requesting party as the Board deems

the requirements of justice, and the Board need not be bound by formal rules of

preponderance of the evidence that the respondent has violated this chapter,
the Board shall, after consultation with the Director of Law in executive
session, state its findings and cause the Director of Law to prepare and issue
an order under Board directive requiring the respondent to cease and desist
from such unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative action as will
effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with notice that if the Board, upon
investigation, determines that the respondent has not, after fifteen calendar
days following the service of the Board's order, complied with such order, the
Board shall recertify the matter to the Director of Law for enforcement.
   (i)   The Director of Law is hereby authorized and directed to pursue
appropriate legal action for the enforcement of this chapter, or other fair
housing laws, as necessary.  Such legal action may be pursued based on evidence
gathered from testing studies which do not involve a bona fide homeseeker.
   (j)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines by the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the respondent has not
violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its findings and
issue its order dismissing the complaint.

Ohio Real Estate Commission, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, the U.S.

2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1361.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Wooster has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. 
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1361.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.

projects;

   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.  (Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1361.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1361.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Wooster as identified in Section

(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1361.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.

these regulations.
      (Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1361.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Wooster, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)    Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)    Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (l)    Flood Fringe: The portion of the Special Flood Hazard Area outside
the Floodway which usually contains slow-moving or standing water.
   (m)    Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (n)    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (o)    Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)    Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)    Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)    Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)    Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)    Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)    Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)    Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (p)    Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (q)    Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (r)    Floodway:
      (1)    The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point.
      (2)    The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (s)    Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard is designed to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)    Hazardous materials: The materials listed or defined in 40 CFR 302.4
or 40 CFR 261.3.
   (u)    Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register; or
      (2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)    Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Wooster's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (v)    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a  professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance
with standard engineering practices as prescribed by FEMA, used to determine
flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (w)    Infectious materials: The materials defined in Ohio Administrative
Code Section 3745-27-01.
   (x)    Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)    Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)    Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (y)    Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (z)    Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (aa)    Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
Section 3701-27-01 , a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon
which three or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either
free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (bb)    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (cc)    New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Wooster
Floodplain Management Regulation [June 21, 2007], and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (dd)    Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (ee)    Radioactive materials: All materials containing radioactive nuclides
that are not  under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, including naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) and
technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM).
   (ff)    Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (gg)    Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (hh)    Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ii)    Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (jj)    Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard" or  “100-year Floodplain", it is the land in the floodplain subject to
a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps
and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.
Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and
designated by other federal, state or local sources of data including but not
limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous
flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
Special Flood Hazard Areas are divided into two areas based on water velocity:
the Floodway and the Flood Fringe.
   (kk)    Start of Construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ll)    Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (mm)    Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (nn)    Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not include:
      (1)    Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (oo)    Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (pp)    Violation: Any non-compliance with these regulations or a permit or
order issued by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (Ord. 2016-05.  Passed 2-21-16.)

1361.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1367.03.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1365.10(a), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         A.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         B.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain permits issued by the Floodplain Administrator shall be
conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from FEMA for
any development proposal subject to subsection (a)(1) hereof.
   (b)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City of Wooster,
and may be submitted at any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Wooster
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City of Wooster’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City’s boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

   1365.11  DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Chapter
1369.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail. 
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1365.12  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain permit prior to repair,
rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain permits and
repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local
agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of
damaged structures materials and other information related to the proper repair
of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of
substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance
claims.

reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
the proposed development would not result in any increase in the base flood
elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1365.10(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Wooster and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Subsection (a)(2), items A. and C.-E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Wooster specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1365.10(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

   1369.04  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Board of Building Appeals shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Board of Building Appeals.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   Each application for a variance shall be accompanied by a fee in
the amount specified in the Schedule of Fees and Charges codified at Chapter
1349 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold
a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a
notice of such hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation in
the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. 
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (c)(1)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation. 
(Ord. 2007-25.  Passed 5-21-07.)
   1369.05  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.

   (c)   All water mains, whether constructed on public or private property,
which are intended for fire protection shall have a diameter of no less than
six inches.  Where a sprinkler system or internal hose racks or standpipes are

property shall be required as follows:
      (1)   Residential.
         For one, two, three and four family residences, including such

at each street intersection, with intermediate hydrants between intersections
located such that spacing does not exceed 500 feet between hydrants (as
measured along actual fire apparatus routes of travel).  In the case of off-
setting intersections, the intersection closest to meeting the desired spacing
shall be used.
      (2)   Commercial/Industrial/Multi-Family Residential:
         A.   For all structures other than one, two, three or four family
residences, hydrants shall be placed so that no portion of any such structure

such installation shall conform with the provisions of NFPA 24, Standard for
the Installation of Private Fire Service Mains and Their Appurtenances, and
shall be installed at the expense of the property owner.
      (3)   General:
         A.   Should the placement of a fire hydrant cause or create the
potential for the Fire Division to lay a hose line(s) across any street,
roadway or railroad right of way, which in the opinion of the Fire Chief, based
upon generally accepted fire suppression requirements and procedures, has such
volume of traffic as to unreasonably impede or impair fire fighting operations,
the Fire Chief may require additional fire hydrants to be located on the same
side of the street, roadway or railroad right of way as the structure to be
served.
         B.   Buildings in which an approved sprinkler or standpipe system has

      (6)   Multiple structures constructed on a parcel of land that is under
the ownership, control, or development by one individual, corporation,
partnership, or firm, excluding farms, shall be known as Planned Building
Groups.  Fire hydrants in such developments shall be supplied by not less than
a six inch diameter main installed on a looped system or not less than an eight
inch diameter main if the system is not looped or the fire hydrant is installed
on a dead-end main exceeding 300 feet in length.  Dead-end mains shall not
exceed 600 feet in length for main sizes under ten inches in diameter.
      (7)   All newly developed Planned Building Groups developed specifically

      (1)     "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the
taxpayer to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)     An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for

Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality  for all or part of the taxable year.

   1701.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
1701.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)     Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
1701.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
1701.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
1701.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
1701.051 of this Chapter.

return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such

      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales

Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.

remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)    Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)     The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
                 (a)       Separate accounting;
                 (b)       The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
                 (c)       The inclusion of one or more additional factors that
would provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to
the Municipality;
                 (d)       A modification of one or more of the factors.
            (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may

Section
1701.19 of this Chapter.

apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section

            (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

                 (a)    The employer;
                 (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer,
or a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
                 (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
            (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
            (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:

taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or
promotion of sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from
such solicitation or promotion.
          (2)     Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)     To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
            (4)     To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
            (5)     Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible
personal property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the

of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal

profit resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.

commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
              (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal
corporation that imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's
net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return
for that municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
1701.081 of this Chapter.
     (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
1701.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

        (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
        (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a

Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.

income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
                (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.
          (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
718.80 of the Revised Code and section
1701.21 of this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(B)(1) or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.

remained of the five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
1701.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
        (2)     No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
Section
1701.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
               (3)     If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity
having at least eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
1701.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
1701.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)     If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)     The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
1701.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
1701.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)     Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.

         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as

following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
1701.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 2018-005.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   1701.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   1701.081 CREDIT FOR TAXES PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   It is the intent of this section that a resident taxpayer, subject to
tax in more than one municipality on the same income, who has complied with the
provisions hereof shall not be required by this chapter to pay a total
municipal income tax on such income greater than the tax imposed at the higher
rate.
   (B)   Therefore, when a resident of the Municipality is subject to and has
paid or has acknowledged liability for a municipal income tax in another
municipality on the same income taxable under this chapter, and such other
municipality does not allow a credit to its nonresidents, such Municipality
resident may claim a credit of the amount of such tax paid to such other
municipality, but not in excess of the tax assessed on this income by this
chapter.
(Ord.  2015-41.  Passed 12-22-15.)
   1701.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord.  2015-41.  Passed 12-22-15.)
   1701.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
1701.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord.  2015-41.  Passed 12-22-15.)
   1701.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
1701.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
1701.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
1701.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
1701.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord.  2015-41.  Passed 12-22-15.)
   1701.09  ANNUAL RETURN.
   1701.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)    (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
1701.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,

      (3)     All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality,

   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. 
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.  Such fiduciary

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)    (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information

municipal corporation, Ohio IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the

through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016.
The department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this
division to the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)    Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)    (1)   (a)     Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each

                         (c)    In the case of individual income tax return
required to be filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return
required to be filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is
required if the amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)     If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)     With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
1701.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
1701.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
1701.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)    (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)     Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the

      (3)     (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City's income tax ordinance for
a taxable year if both the following apply:
            1.    The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location within the City.
            2.    The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to the City's income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b), the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
1701.051 of this Chapter. 
      (1)       If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)       If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.  For
purposes of this section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the
taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be
the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
 
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section 1701.051 of this Chapter
shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against
payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
 
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)     As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
1701.052 of this chapter.
      (2)     A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)    The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2)
of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

   1701.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.

   (A)     Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.

   1701.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
1701.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
Section
1701.19 of this Chapter  for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
1701.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
             (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
1701.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
1701.10 of this Chapter.

   1701.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
1701.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to

      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
1701.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord.  2015-41.  Passed 12-22-15.)
   1701.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord.  2015-41.  Passed 12-22-15.)
   1701.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.    
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
        (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord.  2015-41.  Passed 12-22-15.)
   1701.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
1701.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
1701.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
1701.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
1701.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
(Ord. 2018-005.  Passed 2-20-18.)

   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have

unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other

   (a)    "Director" means the Director of Finance of the City of Wooster.
   (b)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised

breakfast" establishments.
   (c)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising the right uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess, all
or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (d)    "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether

shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have

   1705.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    Commencing on July 1, 1997, or as soon thereafter as permitted by
law, there is levied a tax of three percent (3%) on all rents received by a
hotel for lodging furnished to  transient guests, with total receipts applied
as follows:
      (1)    Four percent (4%) of the funds received shall be charged as an 
administrative-collection fee and retained in the general fund to defray costs
associated with the imposition and administration of the tax.
      (2)    One-half of the remaining balance of such tax receipts shall be
deposited in  the general fund;
      (3)    The remaining one-half of such balance of tax receipts shall be
deposited in a fund designated for promoting economic development.

which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid

   1705.04  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    At the time when the occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged
for, and upon every evidence of occupancy, or any bill or statement or charge
made for an occupancy issued or delivered by the operator, the tax to be
collected shall be stated and charged separately from the rent and shown

written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at
a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should

should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the Director shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted, and shall give written notice to the person in the
