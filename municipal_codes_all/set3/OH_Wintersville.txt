   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.

shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act
committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an

provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

EDITOR'S NOTE
  The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
  This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
  Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
  The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether
by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.
(ORC 1.42)
   (b)   Singular and Plural; Gender; Tense.  As used in the Codified
Ordinances, unless the context otherwise requires:
      (1)   The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the

         B.   "Year" means twelve consecutive months.
            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is
closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for
doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may
be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.  If any legal holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a
legal holiday.
         (ORC 1.14)
      (4)   When legislation is to take effect or become operative from and
after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.
         (ORC 1.15)
      (5)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.

construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (e)   Joint Authority.  All words purporting to give joint authority to

such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall
be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.     Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. 
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C).  If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

171.01  CLERK OF MAYOR’S COURT.
   (a)   Mayor’s Clerk as Clerk of Court.  The Mayor’s Clerk shall also be the
Clerk of the Mayor’s Court.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.  The Clerk shall have general powers to administer
oaths, take affidavits, issue subpoenas and papers arising out of the Mayor’s
Court and approve all bonds, sureties, recognizance and undertakings fixed by
the Mayor or by law.  The Clerk shall file and safely keep all journals,
records, books and papers belonging or appertaining to the Mayor’s Court, and
record its proceedings.
   (c)   Deputy Clerk.  The Chief of Police and the Captain of Police are
hereby appointed to the position of Deputy Clerk of the Mayor’s Court and shall

duties shall be the same as the Clerk as defined in subsection (b).
   (d)   Compensation.  The Clerk and the Deputy Clerk shall serve without any
additional compensation. 
(Ord.  81-9.  Passed 3-20-81.)
171.02  CONTEMPT OF COURT.
   (a)   Direct Contempt.  A person guilty of any of the following acts may be
punished summarily by the Mayor (or a magistrate or the Mayor’s designate in
the absence of the Mayor):
      (1)   Disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the Mayor in
the Mayor’s Court, tending to interrupt the due course of the Court’s
proceeding;
      (2)   A breach of peace, boisterous conduct, or a violent disturbance
tending to interrupt the due course of the Mayor’s Court proceeding;
      (3)   Willful resistance in the presence of the Mayor to the execution of
an order of the Court or the procedure of the Court.
   (b)   Indirect Contempt.  The Mayor, after notice and proper procedural
notice to the defendant, may punish indirect contempts of Court in order to
preserve order in judicial proceedings in the Village of Wintersville and to
effectively enforce the judgments and orders of the Mayor’s Court as follows:
      (1)   The disobedience of or resistance to a lawful order or sentence of
the Court or an officer of the Court;
      (2)   The failure to obey a subpoena lawfully served or the refusal to be
sworn as a witness when lawfully required;
      (3)   The failure of an individual to appear as a witness in Court or to
appear in his or her own case proceeding in compliance with the terms of his or
her previously recognizance;
      (4)   The failure to properly carry out a sentence of the Court,
regarding work detail assignments, home incarceration, restitution or other
lawful sentence of the Court;
      (5)   Any other common law contempt of court for which common pleas
judges may punish as contempts in order that the Mayor may properly enforce
judgments, orders and decrees of the Mayor’s Court.
   (c)   Hearing.
      (1)   The Mayor (or magistrate or the Mayor’s designate in his absence)
may summarily punish for direct contempts of court by entry upon the Mayor’s
Court journal if the Mayor finds the defendant guilty of direct contempt in the
presence of the Court so as to obstruct the administration of justice in the
Mayor’s Court.
      (2)   An individual charged with indirect contempt of court shall have an
opportunity for a hearing, by himself or herself or with the assistance of
counsel, by an entry made upon the Mayor’s Court journal.  This provision does
not prevent the Mayor of the Mayor’s Court from issuing an arrest warrant to
bring the accused into Court or from holding the accused in custody, pending
such proceedings.  In the trial of the indirect contempt charge, the Mayor
shall determine the nature of the charge, hear any answer or testimony which
the accused makes or offers and shall determine whether the accused is guilty
by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.
   (d)   Punishment.  An individual convicted of direct contempt of court may
be imprisoned for not more than ten days or fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00).  In the event that the defendant is guilty of contempt of
court which consists of the omission to perform an act which the defendant has
the capability to perform, the defendant may be imprisoned after conviction
until the defendant performs the act.  If the defendant has failed to appear
upon the date named, the Court may issue an arrest warrant or order the
forfeiture of the appearance bond of the defendant or both.  An individual
found guilty of indirect contempt of court may be fined up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each such contempt and may be imprisoned not more than
ten days for such contempt, or both, in the sole discretion of the Mayor.

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.

compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this

required under Section
185.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section

payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Wintersville. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and the Village of
Wintersville as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole
income subject to the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported
by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required

either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village of Wintersville the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village of Wintersville income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Wintersville income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the

income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village of Wintersville;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of

included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village of Wintersville income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of

more members of such an affiliated group.

refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is

period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
185.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
185.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Wintersville does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
185.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
185.09.

imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

185.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.  (Ord. 2015-
20.  Passed 12-3-15.)
185.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Wintersville
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Wintersville official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-20.  Passed 12-3-15.)
185.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Wintersville that arises pursuant to the Village of
Wintersville's income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village
of Wintersville:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  (Ord. 2015-20.  Passed 12-3-15.)
185.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Wintersville as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Wintersville from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers.  (Ord. 2015-20.  Passed 12-3-
15.)
185.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village of Wintersville
ordinance or state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or

amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

187.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Hotel” means without limitation every establishment kept, used,
maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which six or more
rooms are used for the accommodation of guests, whether the rooms are in one or
several structures.
   (b)   “Transient guests” means a natural person or persons who physically
occupy a room or rooms for sleeping accommodations for less than 180
consecutive days.
   (c)   “Person” means an individual, receiver, assignee, trustee in
bankruptcy, estate, firm, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint
venture, club, society, sole proprietorship, or corporation, and any
combination thereof.
   (d)   “Excise tax” means the tax imposed by the Municipality on transactions
by which lodgings shall be furnished to transient guests.
      (Ord. 2003-12.  Passed 7-3-03.)
187.02  LEVY OF TAX; RATE.
   There is hereby levied and imposed on every person who is a transient guest
in a hotel and pays a charge for lodging therein a tax of two percent (2%) on
the amount paid for such lodging. The tax shall apply to every hotel in the
Municipality for which a charge for lodging is made, notwithstanding the fact
that the reservation for said lodging is made outside of the Municipality.
(Ord. 2003-12.  Passed 7-3-03.)
187.03  COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE OF TAX; INTEREST.
   (a)   Any person receiving a payment on which a tax is imposed under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
lodging payment. Such tax shall be deemed to be held in trust by the person
required to collect the same until paid to the Village as provided in this
section. Any person required to collect such tax who fails to collect the same,
or, having the same, fails to remit the same to the Village in the manner
prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his or her
own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his or her control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the Village for the amount of such tax and
shall, unless the remittance is made as required in this chapter be guilty of a
violation of this chapter.
   (b)   Such tax shall be collected at the time a lodging charge is paid and
shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Tax
Administrator at the end of each month. Remittances therefor shall be made on
or before the twenty eighth day of the month next succeeding the end of the
monthly period in which the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance
of the tax collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is
otherwise required by the Tax Administrator, but payment by check shall not
relieve the person collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance
of the tax to the Administrator, unless the check is honored and is in the full
and correct amount.
   (c)   The person receiving payment for lodging shall make out a return on
such forms and set forth such information as the Administrator may require,
showing the amount of tax on the lodgings for which such person is liable for
the preceding period, and shall sign the same, have it verified by a certified
public accountant and transmit the same to the Administrator with a remittance
for such amount, provided that the Administrator may, at his or her discretion,
require verified annual returns from any person receiving lodging payments
setting forth such additional information as the Administrator may deem
necessary to determine the correct amount of tax collected and payable. The
failure to comply with any requirement of the Administrator as to the report
and remittance of the tax is a violation of this chapter.
   (d)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting such tax
shall, as to lodging and tax collection, be at all reasonable times subject to
examination and audit by the Administrator or his or her agent. If such tax is
not paid when due, there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the
rate of one percent (1%) per month from the time the tax became due until
paid. 
(Ord. 2003-12.  Passed 7-3-03.)
187.04  CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION; FEE.
   Any person conducting or operating a place for the lodging of transient
guests shall, on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, make application
to and procure from the Administrator, a certificate of registration, the fee
for which shall be one dollar ($1.00) per year, which certificate shall
continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same was issued. Such
certificate shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each officer where
sleeping accommodations are assigned.
(Ord. 2003-12.  Passed 7-3-03.)
187.05  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to adopt rules and
regulations not inconsistent with this chapter for carrying out and enforcing
payment, collection and remittance of the tax imposed by this chapter. A copy
of such rules and regulations shall be reported to Council and posted at the
posting places described in Chapter
113 .
   (b)   Until such time as rules and regulations are promulgated pursuant to
this section, the rules and regulations of the State Department of Taxation
relating to excise taxes in effect, except as the same may conflict with this
chapter, shall be deemed to be the rules and regulations hereunder. 
(Ord. 2003-12.  Passed 7-3-03.)
187.06  APPEALS TO COUNCIL.
   Appeals from any ruling of the Tax Administrator under this chapter shall be
made to Council. Said appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days from the
date of said ruling being appealed. Council shall have the authority to annul,
modify or affirm such ruling appealed from, in conformity with the intent and
purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. 2003-12.  Passed 7-3-03.)
187.07  VIOLATIONS.
   No person charged by this chapter with the duty of collecting or remitting
the excise tax on lodgings shall willfully fail or refuse to charge, collect or
pay such tax, or to make a return to the Tax Administrator as required by this
chapter, or to permit the Administrator or his or her duly authorized agent to
examine such person’s books, records and accounts, in or on any premises where
the same are kept, to the extent necessary to verify any return made or to
ascertain and assess the tax imposed by this chapter if no return was made, or
to maintain and keep such books, records and accounts for three (3) years or
such lesser or greater time as may be permitted or required by the
Administrator.
(Ord. 2003-12.  Passed 7-3-03.)
187.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter for which no penalty is otherwise provided is guilty of a misdemeanor
of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000) and/or imprisoned not more than six (6) months. A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or
noncompliance occurs or continues.

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable.  The

specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using a handheld electronic wireless communications device, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.204 except when utilizing any of the following:
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;
            2.   A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short

hand except to activate, deactivate, or initiate a feature or function;
            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving

pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and

loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.

surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.

able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.

confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.

a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.

participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and

of judgment against the person as described in that section.

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.

value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

made, and shall include the defense, settlement and payment of any and all
claims, actions and court judgments for all damages or injuries arising in any
way out of the creation or maintenance of the excavation trench or opening by

and its agents from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
 
   (e)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except where one building stands in the rear of another on an
interior lot and no public sewer is available or can be made available to the
rear building, and no adjoining alley, court, yard, driveway, or right-of-way
in which event the building sewer from the front building may be extended to
the rear building as provided in subsection (d) hereof.
   (f)   Old or existing building sewers may be used only when they are found,
on examination and test by the Superintendent to substantially meet all the
requirements of this chapter.  The owner shall be responsible for all expenses
incident to uncovering and testing such existing sewers.
 
   (g)   All new or replacement sewers that are now connected to or that will
be connected to the municipal sewage collection system and discharging to the
wastewater treatment plant shall be constructed of vitrified clay pipe
conforming to ASTM C 13-57T, plastic PVC 12454B ASTM 30-34 SDR-35 PSM or cast
iron pipe conforming to ASTM C 13-55T or the latest revisions thereof and shall

deemed necessary by the Superintendent shall be made at the expense of the
owner to determine the water tightness of the joints.  Mortar joints will not
be permitted except at the Y-branch and at the junction with the house drain. 
The Superintendent may reject any type of joint or joint material if he has
reason to believe a water tight joint cannot be made.  The building sewer shall
have a fall of not less than one-fourth inch per foot except where the depth of
the public sewer is not sufficient to allow such fall in which event the
building sewer may be constructed at a fall not less than one-eighth inch per
foot.
 
   (i)   Any part of a building sewer that is located within five feet of a
water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron pipe with lead joints. 
The Superintendent may also require the building sewer to be constructed of
cast iron pipe when it is apparent that trees are located in such proximity and
that roots may enter the sewer.  Cast iron pipe will also be required where
unsuitable or unstable soil conditions are encountered.
 
   (j)   Wherever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor.  No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to and within three feet of any basement or foundation wall.  They
shall have a sufficient cover to be below the frost line and in no case with
less than two feet of cover.  The building sewer shall be laid at a uniform
grade and in a straight alignment in so far as possible.  Necessary changes in
direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fittings.
 
   (k)   In all buildings where the building drain would be too low to drain to
the public sewer by gravity, the sewage may be lifted by a sump-pump or other
approved device and discharged to a building sewer which has been constructed
to an elevation above the basement floor.
 
   (l)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent. 
Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM
specifications except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been
inspected.
 
   (m)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location.  If
the public sewer is twelve inches in diameter or less, and no properly located
"Y" branch is available, the owner shall at his expense install a "Y" branch in
the public sewer at the location specified by the Superintendent.  Where the
public sewer is greater than twelve inches in diameter, and no properly located
"Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to
receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle
of about forty-five degrees.  A forty-five degree ell may be used to make such
connection, with the spigot end cuts as not to extend past the linear surface
of the public sewer.  The invert of the building sewer at the point of
connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the
public sewer.  A smooth neat joint shall be made, and the connection made
secure and watertight by encasement in concrete.  Special fittings may be used
for the connection only when approved by the Superintendent.

preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Municipality and
any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Municipality for treatment.  In all such
cases, the provisions set forth in the Municipal  chapter establishing sewer
service charges will be governing factors in any contracts entered into.
 
   (d)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Municipality, they are necessary for proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand,

937.08  WASTEWATER MONITORING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge wastewater
to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of production
and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts and concentrations
of such pollutants that are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this ordinance and any applicable state or federal pretreatment
standards and requirements.
 
   (b)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Municipality.  All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) upon demand.
 
   (c)   If so ordered by the Municipality, the owner or operator of any
premises or facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall
install at his own cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate
the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes.  Such equipment
shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all
times.
 
   (d)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrials user’s premises outside of the building.  When such a location
would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Municipality may
allow such a facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way, with the
approval of the public agency having the jurisdiction of such right-of-way, and
located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping, or
parked vehicles.
 
   (e)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the
Municipality may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each
user.  When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user the
Municipality may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for
each discharge.
 
   (f)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with Municipal requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
 
   (g)   Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in  Section
937.07 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater.  Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-
four hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined
necessary by the Municipality in order to meet the needs of specific
circumstances.
 
   (h)   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standards Methods",
"Methods for Chemical analysis of Water and Waste", published by the U.S. EPA,
or the Annual Book of Standards, part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis",
published by the American Society for Testing and Materials.  Analysis of those
pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA).  In addition, all measurements, test, and analysis of the characteristics
of wastewater shall also be made in conformance with the October 16, 1975
Federal Register (40 CFR Part 1367) entitled "Guidelines for Establishing Test
Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants".
 
   (i)   Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination, with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in this
chapter will be done at such intervals as designated by the Municipality.

provided and maintained at the owner’s own cost and expense.  Detailed plans
showing facilitates and operating procedures to provide this protection shall
be submitted to the Municipality for review, and shall be approved by the
Municipality before construction of the facility.  Review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
 
   (b)   If for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable
to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the Municipality so
that corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system.  In
addition, a written report addressed to the Municipality detailing the date,
time, and cause of the accidental discharge; the quantity and characteristics
of the discharge; and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges,
shall be filed by the responsible industrial facility within five days of the
occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.

divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets or proprietary information of the discharger.
 
   (d)   When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which may disclose trade secrets or processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES
permit, State Disposal System permit, and/or the pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the discharger furnishing the report.    Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

   There are hereby established land subdivision standards, regulations, and
procedures, for the Municipality, that come under the jurisdiction of the

regulations and procedures are to provide a guide for the change that occurs
when land in acreage becomes urban in character as a result of development for
residential, business, industrial or similar purposes; to provide assurance
that the purchasers of lots are buying a commodity that is suitable for
development and use; and to make possible the provision of public services and
utilities in a safe, adequate and efficient manner.

matter that, said unlawful building, structure, or use is in conflict with the
requirements of this Ordinance, said building, structure, or use remains
unlawful hereunder.

renewal provisions of this Ordinance are separable, in accordance with the
following: If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the

building, or structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said
provision to any other property, building, or structure not specifically
included in said judgement.
1131.04  VALIDITY.
   If any article, section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision of this
Ordinance shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,

those of any ordinance or regulation, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be
controlling. Where the provisions of any statute, other Ordinance or
regulations impose greater restrictions than this ordinance the provisions of
such statute, ordinance or regulation shall be controlling.
 
1131.06  SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   All buildings erected hereafter, all uses of land or buildings established
hereafter, any structural alteration or relocation of existing buildings
occurring hereafter shall be subject to all regulations of this Ordinance which
are applicable to the zoning districts in which such buildings, uses, and land
shall be located. However, where a building permit for a building or structure
has been issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance and provided that construction is begun within (6) months of such
effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion said building or
structure may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis
of which the building permit has been issued, and further, may upon completion
be occupied under a certificate of occupancy by the use for which originally

thereof;
      (2)   Issue all certificates of occupancy, including occupancy

this ordinance and report its conclusions and recommendations to the
Legislative Body not less frequently than once a year; hear and decide matters
upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance.
1135.02  CERTIFICATES REQUIRED.
   Except as hereinafter provided, no permit pertaining to the use of land or
buildings shall be issued by any officer, department, or employee unless the
application for such permit has been examined by the Enforcing Officer and has
affixed to it his certificate, indicating that the proposed building or
structure complies with all the provisions of this Ordinance. Any permit or
certificate of occupancy, issued in conflict with the provisions of this
Ordinance, shall be null and void.
   In the event that such an application has affixed to it the certificate of a
"registered architect" or a "registered professional engineer" registered with
the State of Ohio certifying that the building or structure, and the proposed
use thereof, complies with all of the provisions of this ordinance respecting
performance standards for industrial and similar uses, the Enforcing Officer
shall, upon receipt of such application, approve and authorize the issuance of
a zoning certificate, provided all other relevant provisions of this Ordinance
are complied with. Such certificate shall be valid for all purposes. The
Enforcing Officer may, however, before issuance of the occupancy certificate--
as a result of examination of the plans or on the basis of other evidence--
determine that the proposed activity will not in fact comply with the
performance standards and so advise the architect or engineer in writing.
   (a)   Plats.  Every application for a zoning certificate shall be
accompanied by:
(1)   A plat, in duplicate, of the piece or parcel of land, lot, lots, block or
blocks, or parts or portions thereof, drawn to scale showing the actual
dimensions, as certified by a "registered land surveyor" or a "registered
professional engineer," registered with the State of Ohio as a true copy of the
piece or parcel, lot, lots, block or blocks, or portions, thereof, according to
the registered or recorded plat of such land; and
      (2)   A plat, in duplicate, drawn to a scale in such form as may, from
time to time, be prescribed by the Enforcing Officer, showing the ground area,
height, and bulk of the building or structure, the building lines in relation
to lot lines, the use to be made of the building, structure, or land, and such
other information as may be required by the Enforcing Officer for the proper
enforcement of this Ordinance.
      (3)   The Enforcing Officer may, in those cases where in his/her judgment
the information is not necessary because of existing evidence in Village
records, waive all or portions of the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2),
above.
   (b)   Occupancy Certificates.  No building, or addition thereto, constructed
after the effective date of this Ordinance, and no addition to a previously
existing building shall be occupied, and no land, vacant on the effective date
of this Ordinance shall be used for any purpose until a certificate of
occupancy has been issued by the Enforcing Officer. No change in a use and no
home occupation shall be allowed until a certificate of occupancy has been
issued by the Enforcing Officer. Every certificate of occupancy shall state
that the use or occupancy complies with the provisions of this Ordinance.

building permit, home occupation or zoning certification shall be deemed to be
an application for an occupancy certificate, Every application for an occupancy
certificate for a new use of land where no building permit is required shall be
made directly to the Enforcing Officer.
   (d)   Issuance of Occupancy Certificate.  No occupancy certificate for a
building, or portion thereof, constructed after the effective date of this
Ordinance, shall be issued until construction has been completed and the
premises inspected and certified by the Enforcing Officer to be in conformity
with the plans and specifications upon which the zoning certificate was based.
No occupancy certificate for a building, or addition thereto, constructed after
the effective date of this Ordinance shall be issued and no addition to a
previously existing building shall be occupied until the premises have been
inspected and certified by the Enforcing Officer to be in compliance with all
applicable performance standards. Pending the issuance of a regular
certificate, a temporary certificate may be issued to be valid for a period not
to exceed six (6) months from its date during the completion of any addition or
during partial occupancy of the premises. The occupancy certificate shall be
issued, or written notice shall be given to the applicant stating the reasons
why a certificate cannot be issued, not later than 14 days after the Enforcing
Officer is notified in writing that the building or premises are ready for
occupancy.
1135.03  APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   Application for permits shall be made to the Enforcing Officer on such forms
as may be furnished by the Village. Each application shall contain all
information necessary to ascertain whether the proposed erection, alteration,
use, or change in use complies with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   Issuance of Permits.  No improvement location permit or use permit shall be
issued until the Enforcing Officer has certified that the proposed building or
alteration and the proposed use of the property complies with all the
provisions of this Ordinance.
1135.04  COMPLIANCE WITH PLAN.
   Following the issuance of a permit for construction and use in accordance
with the approved plans, no change, deviation, or alteration shall thereafter
be permitted except when authorized by the assessor upon written application,
which application shall be in the nature of an original application for permit.
If the lot or tract for which the development has been approved is sold, the
original conditions upon which approval was granted shall be fulfilled by the
new owners.

of the owner or owners of the property affected, shall be accompanied by a fee
of $100.00. The fee for variances and appeals shall be $10.00. All fees shall
be paid to the Fiscal Officer. There shall be no such fee, however, in the case

presented to it in each specific case that:

topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;

unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      (3)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase financial gain;
      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this Ordinance and
has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the
property;

welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located; and
      (6)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety,
or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
   The Board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises
benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards
established in this section and the objectives of this Ordinance.

event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than 80
percent of the required area and width;

erected or established after the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall
be located on the same zoning lot as the building or use served, except that
parking spaces to serve industrial buildings or uses may be located within 500
feet of such use if said spaces are located in an Industrial District.
   Buildings or uses existing on the effective date of this Ordinance which are
subsequently altered or enlarged so as to require the provision of parking
spaces under this Ordinance, may be served by parking facilities located on
land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located,
provided such facilities are within 500 feet walking distance of the main
entrance to the use served. Owners of property, nonconforming as to parking,
who elect to provide parking and become conforming may locate such parking on
land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use is located, as
allowed in this section.
   Off-street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located in any yard,
except the required front yards in a Residential District. Enclosed buildings
and carports containing off-street parking shall be subject to applicable yard
requirements.
   (b)   Size.  Except for parallel parking spaces, each required off-street
parking space shall be at least eight (8) feet six (6) inches in width and at
least 19 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns,
or office or work areas. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least
seven (7) feet six (6) inches, and shall be measured at right angles to the
axis of the vehicle. For parallel parking, the length of the parking space
shall be increased to 24 feet. All other requirements as to size shall be as
hereinafter set forth in the Off-Street Parking Chart at the end of the
chapter.
   (c)   Access.  Except on lots accommodating single-family dwellings, each
parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway at least 12 feet
wide or such additional width and design as to provide safe and efficient means
of vehicular access to such parking space.
   Access to parking areas in B1 Districts (with the exception of shopping
centers in these districts) should be provided across the side or rear lot
lines where feasible. Access to such parking areas by curb cuts or driveways
across the front lot line should be avoided.
   (d)   Collective Provision.  Off-street parking facilities for separate uses
may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements governing location of accessory
parking spaces in relation to the use served are adhered to. Further, no
parking space or portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than
(1) use unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (e)   Design and Maintenance.  All open off-street parking areas, except a
single parking space accessory to a single-family dwelling, shall be surfaced
with a dustless all-weather material capable of carrying a wheel load of 4,000
pounds (normally, a two-inch (2") black top on a four- inch (4") base or five
(5) inches of Portland Cement will meet this requirement.)
   (f)   Time Requirements.  All parking spaces and off-street parking required
pursuant to the Zoning Ordinances of the Village shall be completed within one
year from the date of any partial occupancy of the building or structure served
by the parking spaces or off-street parking.

1145.03  OFF-STREET LOADING.
   (a)   Location.  All required loading berths shall be located on the same
zoning lot as the use served. All motor vehicle loading berths which abut a
Residence District or an intervening alley separating a Residence District from
a Business or Industrial District shall be completely screened therefrom by
building walls, or by a uniformly-painted solid fence, wall, or door, or any
combination thereof, not less than eight (8) feet in height. No permitted or
required loading berth shall be located within 30 feet of the nearest point of
intersection of any two (2) streets. No loading berth shall be located in a
required front or side yard, and any loading berth located in a required rear
yard may be open to the sky.
   (b)   Size.  Unless otherwise specified, a required off-street loading berth
shall be at least 12 feet in width by at least 30 feet in length, exclusive of
aisle and maneuvering space, and shall have a vertical clearance of at least 15
feet.
   (c)   Access.  Each required off-street loading berth shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement, and shall be subject to approval by
the Enforcing Officer.
   (d)   Surfacing.  All open off-street loading berths shall be surfaced with
a dustless all- weather material capable of bearing a live load of 200 pounds
per square foot.
   (e)   Repair and Service.  No motor vehicle repair work or service of any
kind shall be permitted in conjunction with loading facilities provided in any
Residence District, Business District, or Industrial District, except emergency
service necessary to start vehicles.
   (f)   Utilization.  Space allocated to any off-street loading use shall not,
while so allocated, be used to satisfy the space requirements for any off-
street parking facilities or portions thereof.
   (g)   Central Loading.  Central loading facilities may be substituted for
loading berths on the individual zoning lots, provided that each zoning lot
served shall have direct access to the central loading area without crossing
streets or alleys at grade.
   (h)   Specific Requirements - All Districts.  Off-street loading spaces
accessory to uses permitted in all districts shall be provided according to the
following table.
   All off-street loading spaces hereinafter required by the Ordinance, shall
be designed in accordance with one the formulas set forth in the Off-Street
Loading Table. Off-street loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with
the specific Loading Classes as hereinafter set forth in the Off-Street Loading
Table. Loading Spaces for accessory uses not specifically enumerated shall be
assumed to be included in the principal (permitted) use requirement. If, for
any reason, the classification of any use, for the purpose of determining the
amount of off-street loading, or the amount of space to be provided by such use
is not readily determinable hereunder, the loading class of such use shall be
fixed by the Enforcing Officer.

1147.01  SIGNS AND BILLBOARDS.
   In all zoned districts the following regulations shall apply to all
permitted signs or billboard uses:
   (a)   No sign shall hereafter be erected or altered until a permit for the
same shall have been obtained. In Commercial Districts and Industrial Districts
the application for permit shall be accompanied by a plan drawn to scale,
showing the sign and the size and location of the building upon which the sign
is to be placed.
   (b)   No sign other than traffic or similar official signs shall be
permitted in the right-of- way of any street or highway.
   (c)   No sign shall be placed in such a position as to endanger traffic on a
street or at an intersection. No sign shall be permitted which attempts or
appears to attempt to direct the movement of traffic or which interferes with,
imitates or resembles any official traffic sign, signal or device.
   (d)   Illuminated signs shall be arranged and designed so that the light
does not constitute a nuisance to adjoining premises or a hazardous condition
on the street or highway.
   (e)   No sign may be permitted to be erected or maintained upon trees or
painted or drawn upon rocks or other natural features.
   (f)   No business sign may be located nearer to a Residential District lot
line than is permitted for other business or commercial structures. If any such
sign is located nearer than 50 feet and facing into any Residential District
lot line, it shall be designed so as not to shine or reflect light into
adjacent residences.
   (g)   Any sign located along the right-of-way of a State of Federal Highway
shall comply with any more restrictive requirements of the State of Federal
Government relating thereto.
   (h)   Every sign referred to in this Zoning Ordinance must be constructed of
durable materials and must be kept in good condition and repair. Each sign
shall be erected in a safe manner in accordance with the building and other
pertinent requirements of the Village. Whenever a sign becomes structurally
unsafe or endangers the safety of a building or premises, or endangers the
public safety, the zoning officer shall give written notice to the owner of
this sign or the owner of the premises on which the sign is located that such
sign be made safe or be removed within five days.
   (i)   No sign should exceed 8 ft. in height or 8 ft. in width and may only
advertise the products or services rendered at that location.
   (j)   Billboards are prohibited.
1147.02  RECREATIONAL USES.
   It shall be the purpose of this Ordinance to:
   (a)   Preserve and protect existing recreation facilities which help to
provide adequate and convenient open space and services for all income and age
groups.
   (b)   Recreation uses are considered to be subject to the general provisions
of each District:
   (c)   Recreation Uses (playgrounds, swimming pools, ballfields, etc.) shall
be permitted in the following Districts:
      (1)   Residential Districts (all)
      (2)   Agriculture/Mineral Extraction
      (3)   Conservation/Recreation
1147.03  TRANSIENT ENTERPRISES (TRAVEL TRAILER PARKS).
   Travel trailer parks shall comply with all yard, parking, lighting, and sign
regulations for the district in which they are permitted in addition to the
following:
   (a)   Minimum Area.  Minimum park area shall be two (2) acres. No trailer
unit intended for occupancy shall be located within thirty (30) feet of the
right-of-way line of any public highway or within fifteen (15) feet from any
trailer park boundary line.
   (b)   Maximum Density.  The maximum density shall be twenty-five (25) units
per acre, except that density may be reduced by the Zoning Officer, with
approval of the Planning Commission, for health and sanitary reasons.
   (c)   Unit Setback.  Travel trailers shall be placed so that no trailer
shall be located within twelve (12) feet of another trailer or building.
   (d)   Minimum Utility Requirements.  Each unit shall be equipped with one
(1) electric outlet and one trash container. Fifty (50) per cent of the spaces
shall be provided with a sewer outlet and a water supply tap. The water and
sewer facilities shall be in-tailed in accordance with the specifications of
the Village Administrator.
   (e)   Utility Buildings.  Utility Buildings shall contain adequate numbers
of separate toilet and shower facilities for each sex.
1147.04  ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND UTILITIES.

   (b)   Fire stations
   (c)   Gas regulator stations
   (d)   Police stations
   (e)   Mass transit passenger stations
   (f)   Transportation rights of way
   (g)   Sewage treatment plants
   (h)   Telephone exchange, telephone transmission equipment, buildings and
microwave relay towers.
   (i)   Water works, reservoirs, pumping stations
   (j)   Necessary accessory uses.
1147.05  HEIGHT AND COVERAGE.
   Height and coverage specifications shall be regulated according to the
district applicable. The general rule, however, shall be for each foot the
height of a building or other structure exceeds twenty (20) feet, the total
width of the two side yards shall be increased by two (2) feet.
1147.06  TEMPORARY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   Temporary permits may be issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer for a
period not exceeding one (1) year, for nonconforming uses incident to housing
and construction projects, including such structures and uses as storage of
building materials and machinery, the processing of building materials, and a
real estate office located on the tract being offered for sale, provided such
permits are conditional upon agreement by the owner or operator to remove the
structure or structures or use upon expiration of the permit. Such permits may
be reviewed upon application to the Zoning Enforcement Officer for an
additional period not exceeding one (1) year.
1147.07  FRONTAGE SETBACK AND YARDS.
   No building or part of building, other than the steps, eaves, and similar
fixtures, shall extend nearer to the center line of the street or road than the
distance specified. Where a front yard is required under this Ordinance, the
depth of the required front yard shall be measured from the setback from center
line so specified, instead of from the side line (property line) of the street
or road. However, in no instance shall the above require placing a main
building more than ten (10) feet back of the front main wall of an adjacent
building already existing within (50) feet of, and on the same side of the
street with, the building or part of the building to be erected.
1147.08  ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   (a)   No accessory building or structure constructed on any lot prior to the
time of construction of the principal building to which it is accessory shall
be used for living purposes; shall occupy more than 50 percent of the area of a
required yard; or shall exceed the height of the principal building or
structure.
   (b)   On a reversed corner lot in a Residence District, and within 15 feet
of any adjacent property to the rear in a Residence District, no accessory
building or portion thereof located in a required rear yard shall be closer to
the side lot line abutting the street than a distance equal to two-thirds (2/3)
the least depth which would be required under this Ordinance for the front yard
on such adjacent property to the rear. Further, in the above instance, no such
accessory buildings shall be located within five (5) feet of any part of a rear
lot line which coincides with the side lot line or portion thereof of property
in any Residence District.
   No accessory building shall be erected in or encroach upon the required side
yard of a corner lot which is adjacent to the street, nor upon the required
side yard of a reversed corner lot which is adjacent to the street.
1147.09  INTERCHANGE ZONING  AND TRAFFIC VISIBILITY.
   The regulations contained in this section shall apply within those
geographic areas indicated on the Wintersville Zoning District Map as lying
within an "Interchange Control Area." Within such designated areas, all
requirements prescribed in this Ordinance for the zoning district proper shall
be complied with; and in addition, the following regulations, which are
intended to promote traffic safety, increase traffic efficiency, and improve
the appearance of interchange areas.
   (a)   Setback from Intersecting Highway  Buildings and structures shall be
set back at least 80 feet from the right-of-way line of intersecting highways
and 150 feet from any expressway or limited access highway. In the case of
unusual changes in alignment of the highway right-of-way line or unusual
topographic conditions which would cause undue hardship in the application of
this requirement a variance for a lesser setback from the intersecting highway
may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   Limitation of Access  Access from abutting property to an intersecting
highway shall be permitted only at designated access points. Such access points
shall be located as follows:
There shall be no access points located within 1,000 feet of the most remote
end of taper of any existing or proposed entrance or exit ramp of an
interchange, or within 1,000 feet of median crossovers, or at intervals of less
than 1,000 feet thereafter. A lesser distance may be permitted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals upon prior written approval by a designated representative of
the agency having Jurisdiction over such highway.
To avoid dangerous offset intersections, public streets along opposite sides of
intersecting highways shall be located either directly opposite each other or
directly opposite a median strip crossover, or separated by at least 300 feet
of lateral distance as required by the particular circumstances to permit safe
traffic movement as determined by the agency having jurisdiction over the
intersecting highway.
1147.10  CONDITIONAL USES AND STANDARDS.
   Where a use is classified as a conditional use under this Ordinance, and
exists as a conditional or permitted use at the date of the adoption of this
Ordinance, it shall be considered to be a legal conditional use.
   Where a use is not allowed as a conditional or permitted use under this
Ordinance, and exists as a conditional use at the date of the adoption of this
Ordinance it shall be considered to be a nonconforming use and shall be subject
to the applicable nonconforming use provisions.
1147.11  NUMBER OF BUILDINGS ON A ZONING LOT.
   Except in the case of planned developments, not more than one principal
detached residential building shall be located on a zoning lot, nor shall a
principal detached residential building be located on the same zoning lot with
any other principal buildings.
1147.12  MINIMUM LOT SIZE.
   The minimum requirements shall be six thousand square feet of lot area for
each dwelling.
1147.13  OBSTRUCTION OF WATERCOURSE CHANNELS.
   To prevent encroachment upon, or constriction of, river or creek channels,
and thereby avoid obstruction to the natural conveyance of water flow in such
rivers, creeks, and other natural watercourses, there shall not be placed,
erected, or located within the banks of such watercourses any building or
structure, pier or marina, or retaining or revetment wall--except authorized
bridges or dams. In addition, there shall not be placed any filling of earth,
ashes, rubbish, rubble, concrete, masonry, or any other kinds of fill.
   However, this provision may be waived if the structure or fill is approved
by the Wintersville Planning Commission, the Legislative Body, the U.S. Corps
of Engineers, and other applicable public bodies.
1147.14  BULK REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Continued Conformity with Bulk Regulations.  The maintenance of yards
and other open space and minimum lot area legally required for a building shall
be continuing obligation of the owner of such building or of the property on
which it is located, as long as the building is in existence. Furthermore, no
legally required yards, other open space, or minimum lot area allocated to any
building shall, by virtue of change of ownership or for any other reason, be
used to satisfy yard, other open space, or minimum lot area requirements for
any other building.
   (b)   Division of Zoning Lots.  No improved zoning lot shall hereafter be
divided into two or more zoning lots and no portion of any improved zoning lot
shall be sold, unless all zoning lots resulting from each such division or sale
shall conform with all the applicable size regulations of the zoning district
in which the property is located.
   (c)   Location of Required Open Space.  All yards and other open spaces
allocated to a building or dwelling group shall be located on the same zoning
lot as such building or dwelling group.

other property in the district not be permitted to continue without
restriction.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of
nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses and to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which such nonconforming buildings,
structures, and uses shall be permitted to continue.
1149.02  EXISTING USES SAFEGUARDED.
   Any nonconforming building, structure, or use which existed lawfully at the
time of the adoption of this Ordinance and which remains nonconforming, and any
such building, structure, or use which shall become nonconforming upon the
adoption of this Ordinance, or of any subsequent amendments thereto, may be
continued subject to the regulations which follow.
1149.03  RESTRICTIONS.

said repairs, alterations, or structural changes conform to the regulations of
the district in which said building or structure is located.
   (b)   Additions and Enlargements.  A nonconforming building or structure
which is nonconforming as to bulk, and is designed or intended for a permitted

structure, or premises shall conform to the use regulations of the district in
which such building, structure, or premises is located.
   (d)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use.  The nonconforming use of part of a
building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or
intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is located, may be
extended throughout the building or structure in which said use is presently
located, but no changes or structural alterations which increase the bulk of
the building or structure shall be made unless such changes or structural
alterations, and the use thereof, conform to all the regulations of the
district in which the building or structure is located.
   (e)   Changes of Nonconforming Use.  Building or structure designed or
intended for a nonconforming use: The nonconforming use of a building or

aluminum, plastic or other polymer based item, shrubbery, hedges or any other
material erected in such a manner and positioned so as to enclose or partially
enclose any premises or any part of any premises. Trellises or other structures
supporting or used for the purpose of supporting vines, flowers and other
vegetation when erected in such position so as to enclose any premises or any
part of any premises shall be included within the definition of "fences".
Structures which have an ornamental purpose and which do not in fact serve the
purpose of enclosing or partially enclosing premises or of separating premises
from adjoining premises, shall not be included within the definition of
"fences".
   (d)   Permitted Fences.  Subject to the yard requirements and open spaces as
set forth in the pertinent zoning district, the following fences shall be
permitted as follows:
      (1)   Fences erected on the property or lot line shall not extend in
front of the face of the building extended to the adjacent property or lot
line.
      (2)   Any fence erected within ten feet of any intersection shall not
exceed four feet above the natural grade. Where a fence is constructed on an
embankment, or where the ground under a fence has been graded to a higher level
than the surrounding ground, the permissible height of the fence, as set forth
in this section shall be reduced by the height of the embankment or grading.
      (3)   Any fence erected greater than ten feet from any intersection may
exceed  a height of four feet.
      (4)   The height of any fence shall not include the posts, except,
however, the posts may not exceed the fence height by more than six inches.
      (5)   A fence of permitted height and design may be erected along or upon
common property lines and across any utility easement so as to allow maximum
use of the premises to be enclosed.  Fences placed on utility easements shall
provide access to manholes, utility boxes, cleanouts, lift stations or other
apparatus that may be used from time to time for the maintenance of the
utility. Fences in drainage easements shall require prior approval of the
Village Engineer to allow for proper flow of water.
      (6)   No fence shall be erected or located within three feet of a
manhole, utility box, cleanout, lift station or other apparatus that  may be
used from time to time for the maintenance of the utility. When a fence
obstructs access to a manhole, utility box, cleanout, lift station or other
apparatus that may be used from time to time for the maintenance of the
utility, the owner  shall be required to remove such fence at his or her
expense without remuneration  from the Municipality.
         (Ord. 1996-32.  Passed 12-3-96.)
      (7)   Any permitted fence shall be designed, constructed and finished so
that the supporting apparatus and members thereof face the property of the
owner of the fence.
   (e)   Maintenance. Permitted fences shall be maintained in good condition,
be structurally sound and attractively finished at all times. Any grounds
between a permitted fence and the property or lot line shall be well maintained
and in compliance with all applicable ordinances of the Village at all times.
(Ord. 2004-19.  Passed 9-8-04.)
   (f)   Permit and Inspection. 
      (1)    Any fences which may be permitted shall require the issuance of a
permit by the Building Inspector after the same has been approved by him.
      (2)    Each property owner shall determine property lines and ascertain
that the fence thus constructed does not deviate from the plans as approved by
the Building Inspector issuing permits and does not  encroach  upon another lot
or parcel of 1and. The Municipality shall furnish such inspection as is deemed
necessary to determine that the fence is constructed in accordance with plans
submitted for permit, provided, however, that the issuance of such permit by
the Municipality shall not be construed to mean the Municipality has determined
the fence is not encroaching upon another lot, nor shall it relieve the
property owner of the duty imposed upon him herein.
   (g)   Compliance Required; Conflicting Provisions.
      (1)    Fences shall be designed, erected, altered, reconstructed, moved,
anchored, positioned and maintained, in whole or in part, strictly in
accordance  with the provisions of this section and the permit that is issued.
      (2)    To the extent that the provisions of this section are included in
or similar to restrictive covenants contained in any deeds of record or
recorded plats or approved subdivisions, or the  contents of  an approved
zoning plan, then the contents of such restrictive covenants, approval of plats
or subdivisions or plans shall control to the extent they are not in conflict
with this section.
   (h)   Penalty. Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be
deemed guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00). Each day that such violation occurs or continues
shall constitute a separate offense.

safety, comfort, or welfare is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and
shall henceforth be unlawful.
Particulate matter emissions caused by the wind from open storage areas, yards,
roads, etc., within lot lines shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate
landscaping, paving, oiling, wetting, or other means.
For the purpose of determining the density or equivalent capacity of smoke, the
Ringelmann Chart as adopted and published by the United States Bureau of Mines
in Circular No. 8333 shall be employed.
No industrial operation shall cause or allow to be emitted into the open air
from any process or control equipment, or to pass any convenient measuring
point in a breeching or stack, dust in the gases to exceed 0.85 pounds per
thousand pounds of gases adjusted to 12 percent C02 content for the products of
combustion.
         B.   Permitted Smoke Emission. Within 1,000 feet of a residence or
business zoning district boundary line, the continuous emission of smoke from
any vent, stack, chimney, or combustion process shall have a density or
equivalent capacity of less than Ringelmann No. 1.
Smoke in excess of Ringelmann No. 1, but not exceeding Ringelmann No. 2, shall
be permitted for five (5) minutes in any one hour. Smoke not exceeding
Ringelmann No. 3 shall be permitted for five (5) minutes during any eight-hour
period for purposes of fire-cleaning only. Smoke in excess of Ringelmann No. 3
is prohibited.

materials which are released shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the maximum
permissible airborne concentration allowed an industrial worker when measured
at any point beyond the lot line, either at ground level or habitable
elevation, whichever is more restrictive. When maximum permissible airborne
concentrations of toxic materials allowed are not contained in the most recent
list of Threshold Limit Values published by the American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists, the applicant shall satisfy the Health
Officer that proposed levels will be safe to the general population.
      (5)   Odorous Matter Limitations.  The release of odorous matter from any
Industrial District across Residence or Business District boundary lines shall
be so controlled that, at ground level or at habitable elevations, the
concentration shall not exceed the odor threshold. Further, the release of
odorous matter across lot lines shall not become a nuisance or source of
discomfort to neighboring uses.
      (6)   Glare Limitations.  In any industrial District, any operation or
activity pro ducing intense glare shall be so conducted that direct and
indirect illumination from the source of light shall not cause illumination in
excess of one-half (½) of one foot candle when measured at any Residence
District boundary line. Flickering or intense sources of light shall be so
controlled as not to cause a nuisance across any lot lines.

lands best suited to agriculture by preventing undesirable and indiscriminant
development of mixed rural/urban uses which creates incompatibility of land
uses and places unbalanced and unwarranted tax loads on agricultural lands to
help pay for urban services. The agricultural district also will help deter the
illogical and premature termination of agricultural pursuits.

1335.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The control shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures:  The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices:  The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include:  temporary seeding,  permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1:  Permanent Stabilization

Disturbed areas that will be idle over   Prior to November 1.
winter.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.   Applicants  shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows.  Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding,  mulching,
erosion control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with
bioengineering techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most
recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical
Guide available at www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.  Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, and diversions to
direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from  exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas.  Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days.  Such practices may include,  among others:  sediment, settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment steeling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff to a sediment-settling pond.  All
sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be
considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not
considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment-settling pond.
Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment Control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity.  Sediment basins and perimeter
sediment barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and  within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds.  Concentrated storm water runoff and
runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or
inlet protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a sediment
settling pond or equivalent best management practice upon approval from
Wintersville.
The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67 cubic yards of
storage per acre of total contributing drainage area.  When determining the
total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas which remain
undisturbed by construction  activity must be included unless runoff from these
areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is not co- mingled
with sediment-laden runoff.  The depth of the sediment settling pond must be
less than or equal for five (5) feet.  The configuration between the inlets and
the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each one
unit of width  (>2:1 length: width ratio).  Sediment must be removed from the
sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40
percent.  This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of
the basin depth.  When designing sediment- settling ponds, the applicant must
consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design
factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used
where site limitations would preclude a safe design.  The use of combination of
sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant
removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow.  Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed
on a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below.  Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such
devices, which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff
from areas up to 10 acres.
Table 3:  Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 linear feet of silt Range of Slope for a
fence                                                    drainage area (%)
0.5                                                      <2%
0.25                                                     > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                                    > 20% but <50%
      (4)   Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled.  These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad or aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2” in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specializations in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development areas, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.  Based on site
conditions, Wintersville may require additional best management practices to
control off site tracking and dust.  These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.   Designated wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1335.09(g) of this regulation.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  Wintersville may require dust controls
including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles,
temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of
vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Stream protection. Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands.  If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designated as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land  Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment  runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of steam
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls.If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used in appropriately or incorrectly, the
applicant shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls:  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff.  The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or
wetlands.  These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out:  The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal:  Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly.  Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site.  Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control.  There shall be no  sediment laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections.  All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least one every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period.  The applicant shall
assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure
that the control practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is
adequate, or whether additional control measures are required.  Qualified
inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in the
installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls.
These inspections shall met the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed  to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by Wintersville or an alternate form
acceptable to Wintersville.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
noncompliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization.  All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization.  The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by Wintersville.  When inspections reveal the
need for repair, replacement, or installation or erosion and sediment control
BMP’s , the following procedures shall be followed.
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance.   If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function.     If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.  If the internal inspection reveals
that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a
statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (j)   Final Stablization. Final stabilization shall be determined by
Wintersville.
      (Ord. 2005-20.  Passed 7-28-05.)
1335.10  ABBREVIATED STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources and
wetlands, the applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the
requirements of this regulation.
   (b)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a professional engineer, a
registered surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs. 
Wintersville may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction entrances:  Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area.  These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2” in
diameter, placed over a geotextile, fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development
Manual.
      (2)   Street sweeping:  Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.

Note:  Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.  These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
 
      (4)   Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Internal inspection and maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When practices require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When practices fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When practices depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not
installed. If the internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not
been implemented in accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be
implemented within ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the
inspection reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record
must contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.

Review of flood plain management ordinances - see Ohio R.C. 1521.18
1339.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.  Therefore, the Council of
the Village of Wintersville, State of Ohio, does ordain this Chapter of the
Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2006-07.  Passed 3-2-06.)
1339.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Wintersville has special flood hazard areas that are subject
to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base.  Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss.  In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted. 
(Ord. 2006-07.  Passed 3-2-06.)
1339.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and

and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
      (Ord. 2006-07.  Passed 3-2-06.)

See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:

hazard in specific areas of a community.  Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.

      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
      Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two
(2) feet of freeboard.  In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge.  A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height.  In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following:  Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure
Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.  LOMC’s are broken down into the following
categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features.  One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by
fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the
special flood hazard area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria.  A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure.  This definition excludes an “enclosure below the lowest floor”
which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".  For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park.  A tract of land that
is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for
sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots,
is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes
are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. 
This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods.  Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
initial effective date of the Village of Wintersville Flood Insurance Rate Map,
January 5, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies.  An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code Section 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college.  “Agency” does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General’s Department, or
any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture under the
provisions of Sections 4703.01 to 4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30,
and A99.  Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are
floodprone and designated from other federal, state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.  The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.  Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure.  For a substantial improvement, the actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement.  This
term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless
of the actual repair work performed.  The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations consistent with the
variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.

review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1339.33 through
1339.38 Appeals and Variances.

Floodplain Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

1339.32  ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1339.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in increased
base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are not
feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Wintersville and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.    Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1339.32(a)(2), items A. and C. - E..
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.  The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites:  An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Wintersville specifying the  maintenance responsibilities.  If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1339.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
         (Ord. 2006-07.  Passed 3-2-06.)
1339.33  APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.

(Ord. 2006-07.  Passed 3-2-06.)
1339.36  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance.  The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold
a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the hearing, a
notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires.  In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. 
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it
deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1339.36(c)(1)A. to K. have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 2006-07.  Passed 3-2-06.)
1339.37  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
