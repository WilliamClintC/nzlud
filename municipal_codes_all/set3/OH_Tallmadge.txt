EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

together and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and
office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more than
200 words of the grounds for the removal.

petition sufficient. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition
sufficient, the Clerk shall promptly so certify to the Council, and shall
deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and

seven days after the day on which such delivery was made, the Council shall
thereupon fix a day for holding a recall election, not more than seventy-five
days after the date of such delivery. If the officer to be recalled was elected
by the electors of the entire City, such recall election shall be conducted in
the entire City. If the officer to be recalled was elected by the electors of a
single ward, such recall election shall be conducted in such single ward.
   At such recall election this question shall be placed upon the ballot:
"Shall (naming the officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?",
with the provision being made on the ballot for voting affirmatively or
negatively on such question. If a majority of the votes cast at such election
shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall remain in office. If a
majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such officer shall be
considered as removed, the office shall be declared vacant, and such vacancy
shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed by such recall
election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy created thereby.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments

amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. 
(ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. 
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

Service rules and regulations, until three readings and a public hearing on
said action shall have occurred.  In the event that a public hearing is open at
one meeting and continued to another, it shall be deemed properly noticed
provided the new date is announced at the time the hearing is continued.

125.02  MINIMUM FUND BALANCE POLICY.
   (a)    Purpose. This policy is designed to take a proactive approach to
financial management in the City of Tallmadge. A minimum fund balance policy
assists the City in maintaining the security of major operating funds and
contributes to the financial stability of the City by maintaining adequate
financial reserves. Also, a minimum fund balance policy will allow the
Administration and Council to recognize and react to warning indicators of
financial stress and set guidelines for proactive measures.
   (b)    Policy. At the time of budget preparation, annual appropriations
shall be adjusted to ensure that the Anticipated Fund Balances are greater than
or equal to the Minimum Fund Balance as described in the scope of this policy.
   (c)    Definitions.
      (1)    "Projected Beginning Fund Balance" means the projected
unencumbered fund balance for the beginning of the fiscal year. The projected
beginning fund balance is calculated at the time the budget is prepared.
      (2)    "Operating Appropriation" means total appropriations including
transfers for Bond Retirement and Pension as these represent ongoing
commitments of the City. Excluded are all other transfers and capital
appropriations.
      (3)    "Anticipated Revenue" means the amount of revenue the City expects
to receive in the upcoming fiscal year to fund annual appropriations.
      (4)    "Anticipated Fund Balance" means an amount equal to the Projected
Beginning Fund Balance less Total Appropriations plus Anticipated Revenue. The
anticipated fund balance is calculated at the time the budget is prepared.
      (5)    "Financial Review Committee" means a committee to review financial
matters of the City, consisting of the Director of Finance, Mayor, Director of
Administration, Chairman of Finance Committee of Council, and member of the
Finance Committee of Council.
   (d)    Scope.
      (1)    This Policy applies to all Major Funds used by the City and are
listed below in three different categories:
         A.    Category 1: These funds have more than one million dollars
($1,000,000) in operating appropriations and receive no more than 10% of
revenue from transfers. They have their own significant source of revenues and
therefore should be required to carry a minimum fund balance of 25% of
operating appropriations. These funds are Category 1 Major Funds and include:
General Fund, Sanitary Sewer Operating Fund, and Water Operating Fund.
         B.    Category 2: These funds have more than one million dollars
($1,000,000) in operating appropriations. They rely heavily on operating
transfers and therefore should be required to carry a smaller minimum fund
balance of 8.5% of operating appropriations. These funds are Category 2 Major
Funds and include: Fire/EMS Fund and Street Maintenance and Repair Fund.
Note: The Self Insurance Fund would fall under a Category 2 fund, although it
has separate legislation that requires a minimum balance of one hundred
thousand dollars ($ l,000,000) due to the nature of that fund.
         C.    Category 3: These funds are created for the sole purpose of a
capital project, whether governmental, enterprise, internal service, trust, or
agency funds. These are Category 3 Major Fund status even if they satisfy the
criteria for the above two categories. There is no requirement to maintain a
minimum fund balance on these funds.
      (2)    All other funds are considered minor funds and are not required to
maintain a minimum fund balance. Funds may be recategorized as needed if they
meet the requirements of Category 1, 2, or 3 at a future date.
   (e)   Application.
      (1)    The anticipated fund balance will be calculated at the time of
budget preparation. Anticipated fund balance will be calculated taking the
budget year's projected beginning fund balance less appropriations (which may
include debt service) plus anticipated revenue. The resulting fund balance must
comply to the minimum fund balances established in the scope of this policy.
      (2)    This policy will be applied to the annual operating budget of the
City prior to presenting it to Council. Any changes in the budget made by
Council must also comply with the restrictions established in this policy prior
to the adoption of the annual appropriation ordinance.
   (f)    Monitoring. Fund balances will be monitored on a month-to-month
basis. Monitoring projections will be based upon trend data. The fund balances
may drop temporarily below the minimum level due to current operations or
emergencies. Additional monitoring and reports will be done per the Financial
Action Plan when required.
   (g)    Compliance. Once it is determined that the City cannot meet the
requirements of this policy, the Mayor will include a concise statement in the
annual appropriations ordinance explaining the decision to waive the policy.
The statement should include the present financial status of the City, a
specified timetable for returning to the policy, and reason(s) given for
overriding the policy. Should it be determined that the City will not be able
to fall within conformance within one year, the Financial Action Plan will be
implemented.
   (h)    Financial Action Plan.  Once it is determined that the General Fund
will not be able to meet the required 25% reserve, the financial action plan
shall be implemented in various stages for each category of funds.
      (1)    Category I Funds - General Fund:
         A.    Step I Projected reserves drop between 20% to 25%.

CHAPTER 145
Records Commission
145.01   Public records policy.
CROSS REFERENCES
Photostat or microfilm recording - see Ohio R.C. 9.01
 
145.01  PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (a)   Records Defined.  For purposes of this Chapter, “records” means any
document, paper, electronic including but not limited to e-mail, or other
format, that is created or received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a
public office that documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities of the City of Tallmadge.  All
records of the City of Tallmadge are public unless they are specifically exempt
from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code or otherwise by law.
   (b)   Records Policy.  It is the policy of the City of Tallmadge that public
records will be organized and maintained so that they can be made available for
inspection and copying at all reasonable times during regular business hours. 
Record retention schedules are to be made readily available to the public.
   (c)   Records Requests.
      (1)   Each request for public records will be evaluated for a response in
accordance with the following guidelines:
      (2)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records.  If
it is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian for the
office must contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the
requestor in revising the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
      (3)   A requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public records.
      (4)   Public records are available for inspection at all reasonable times
during regular business hours with the exception of published holidays. 
Records are available in the Police Department, Fire Department, and Street
Department during hours posted at those locations.
      (5)   Records are to be made available for inspection promptly.  Copies
of public records are to be made available within a reasonable period of time. 
“Prompt” and “reasonable” take into account the volume of records requested;
the proximity of the location where the records are stored; the age of the
records; and the necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
      (6)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records.  Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so.  Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, current meeting minutes, budgets, salary information, forms and
applications, current personnel rosters, etc.  If fewer than 20 pages of copies
are requested, or if the records are readily available in an electronic format
that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be made as quickly as
the equipment and personnel allows.  If more copies are requested, the
requester will make an appointment to pick up the copies.
      (7)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or
acknowledged in writing by the public office receiving the request.  A good
faith effort should be made to respond within three business days of the
receipt of the request.  If a request is deemed significantly beyond “routine”,
such as keeping a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research,
an acknowledgment of the request should be made.

writing that he/she does not intend to use or forward the records or the
information contained in them, for commercial purposes.
   (d)   Denial of Record Request.  Any denial of public records requested must
include an explanation, including legal authority.  If portions of a record are
public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the
remainder of the record released.  If there is a redaction, each must be
accompanied by a supporting explanation, including legal authority.  Each

   (h)   Failure to Respond to a Public Record Request.  The City of Tallmadge
recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to properly respond
to a public record request.  In addition to the distrust in government that

utilization of qualified women and members of minority groups in each major job
group.
      (4)   Application of equal employment opportunity in all personnel
actions.
         A.   Recruitment.
            1.   In all recruitment activities, effort will be made to attract
numbers of candidates including qualified persons for whom equality of
employment opportunity is especially sought by this policy, so that fair
consideration can be given to them.  As may be feasible, candidates will be
sought from sources, institutions, or publications through which qualified
candidates might be expected to be located and informed of the job
opportunities at all levels.
            2.   The Civil Service Commission will serve as the central
recruiting office for classified civil service employment and will apply the
principles specified herein in the recruitment of personnel into such
employment and in referral of candidates to appointing department heads.
            3.   Other departments and appointing authorities responsible for
the process of recruitment of non civil service and other special personnel of
the City, contract or otherwise, will also apply the principles of
nondiscrimination in recruitment practices.
         B.   Selection for employment.
            1.   Applicants for job openings will be considered on a basis of
qualifications only as those qualifications relate to specific job-related
selection criteria.
            2.   Reasonable records will be kept on the history of each
employment, sufficient to indicate whether, in what manner, and to what extent
the principles of this policy have been applied.  Such records will reflect,
but not be limited to, the specific basis on which one candidate was offered
appointment in preference to all others.
            3.   All applications for regular positions will be retained for a
minimum of one year.  All applications for temporary positions will be retained
for six months.
            4.   The EEOC will monitor the flow of appointments and of their
respective recruitment circumstances, and will counsel department heads
especially with regard to areas of operations where major opportunity for
improvement emerges.  Job criteria will be reviewed as necessary to guard
against invalid disproportionate rejection of candidates by racial or ethnic
groups or by sex.
                   C.      Job assignment.  Candidates accepted for appointment
will be assigned to positions for which they are qualified without reference to
race, religion, color, sex, national origin, handicap or identity as a disabled
veteran or veteran of the Vietnam era and age insofar as required by law.
         D.   Testing.
            1.   Applicants who are required to pass a test to be considered
for employment, job assignment, transfer or promotion will be advised of any
scoring requirements if rigid requirements for passing are imposed, and will be
informed of their test results.  Results of tests taken will be retained by the
EEOC.
            2.   Tests and standards of passing shall not, inadvertently or
otherwise, result in unlawful discrimination or adverse impact, and will be
reviewed upon each administration to preclude unlawful discrimination from
occurring.
         E.   Promotion.
            1.   Records shall be maintained and updated annually whereby
lateral and/or vertical movement of employees can be ascertained and evaluated
with special reference to equality of opportunity for promotion.

successfully in the more advanced position; and, as may be allowable under law
and regulations, length of service.

organizations, insofar as they apply to promotions as well as to other matters,
shall conform to law both as to content and implementation.
         F.   Layoffs and terminations.
            1.   Unlawful discrimination shall not be the basis for layoff or
termination of employment of any employee.
            2.   In the event of any substantial and necessary planned
reductions in force, the City will prepare such plans with reference to the
equal employment opportunity policy, in addition to other factors; and all
reasonable and lawful steps will be taken to assure that no layoff or
termination occurs on a basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin,
age, handicap or identity as a disabled veteran or veteran of the Vietnam era. 
As to persons covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the lawful terms of
the agreement regarding layoff and termination shall prevail.
         G.   Salary and fringe benefits.
            1.   No award of salary or fringe benefits to any employee shall be
on a basis of discrimination as to race, color, age, religion, sex, national
origin, handicap, or identity as a disabled veteran or veteran of the Vietnam
era.
            2.   Each department head of the City will review periodically the
salary and fringe benefit status of all of its employees, with special
reference to reassurance that no unlawful discrimination exists between
individual employees in equivalent positions with comparable qualification,
experience, responsibilities, and performance levels.  Remedies proved to be
needed will be made, according to law, and subject to availability of
resources.
         H.   Terms and conditions of employment.
            1.   There shall be no unlawful discrimination as to the terms and
conditions of employment.  For purposes of this policy, terms and conditions of
employment shall include but not be limited to such factors as working
environment, educational and training opportunities, deliberative processes
unless required by a lawful collective bargaining agreement, or attendance
requirements.
            2.   Subject to law and regulations, women will not be specially
penalized in their conditions of employment because of pregnancy or
childbirth.  Maintenance of seniority or other fringe benefits shall be on the
same basis as in the case of other officially authorized leaves of absences
subject to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
   (f)   EEO Complaint Resolutions.
      (1)   A formal grievance procedure has been established under this
policy.
         A.   A grievance is a complaint, dispute or other controversy in which
it is claimed that the City has failed in an obligation under the EEO policy or
related laws or regulations.
         B.   All grievances shall be dealt with promptly and every effort be
made to settle grievances as close to the source as possible.

initiated by any employee of the City.
            1.   Step 1:  A grievance must be presented orally or in writing,
at the choice of the aggrieved, to the appropriate supervisor, or in his/her

department head shall have five days following such presentation to submit an
oral response.
            2.   Step 2:  If the grievance is not settled at the first step the
aggrieved will reduce the grievance or allegation to writing.  The written

EEOC for a hearing.
            5.   Hearing time.  The Commission shall schedule a hearing within
thirty days at a time and place convenient to the parties.
            6.   Jurisdiction.  The Commission shall be expressly limited to
the meaning, intent, or application of the provisions of this policy.  It shall
have no power to add to, detract from, or alter in any way these provisions.
            7.   Decision in Writing.  The decision of the EEOC shall be in
writing.
      (2)   Whenever any such formal grievance or complaint is filed, and
consists of or includes alleged discrimination in violation of the equal
employment opportunity policy or of laws pertaining to equal opportunity, the
procedure shall also include immediate notification to the EEOC.  The EEOC will
separately examine the element or elements of the grievance alleging
discrimination, and will provide the results of such examination to the Mayor,
Law Director, and the appropriate appointing authority, before final
disposition of the grievance.
      (3)   Remedial action shall be taken immediately upon determination of a

      (4)   In any instance in which a complainant files a complaint with a
governmental agency of competent jurisdiction, alleging discrimination in
violation of valid laws and regulations, and in which the City is officially
notified of such complaint, the complaint shall be examined by the EEOC.  In
instances requiring external responses, there shall be consultation with the
Mayor and Law Director before formal response.
   (g)   Handicapped Provisions.  Special provisions relating to the
handicapped are:
      (1)   A "handicapped person" is defined as one who:
         A.   Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits
one or more major life activities.
         B.   Has a record of such impairment.
         C.   Is regarded as having such an impairment.
      (2)   Pursuant to law, the City does not discriminate against any
employee or applicant because of handicap, in regard to any position for which
the employee or applicant is qualified.
      (3)   The City will make reasonable accommodation to the known
limitations of a qualified handicapped applicant or employee, unless the
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the City or unless the safety
or health of employees, the public or recipients of City services, would be
adversely affected by such accommodation of placement.  In determining what
does not constitute  reasonable accommodation, the elements of business
necessity, financial cost, and any relating personnel problems, among others,
may be considered.
      (4)   Special care will be taken to ensure that employment criteria are
job related and do not needlessly have the effect of excluding the handicapped
from consideration.  The EEOC will review position employment criteria from
time to time and will act as the compliance coordinator.
      (5)   The City may inquire into an applicant's ability to substantially
perform job related tasks effectively and safely, and into the extent and
status of the job-related handicap, provided that information be voluntarily
given and shall be kept confidential except as provided herein.
      (6)   The City may require a physical examination of any employee or of
any applicant who has been conditionally offered employment.  Such examination
shall not result in unlawful discrimination on the basis of handicap and the
results shall be held confidential except as provided herein.
      (7)   Information obtained by a required medical examination, or by
inquiries into applicants' or employees' physical and mental conditions shall
be kept confidential except that appropriate supervisors shall be informed
regarding restrictions on the work duties of handicapped persons and any
reasonable accommodations required; and except as first aid and safety
personnel need to be informed; and except as compliance reporting under law
requires inclusion of such information.

themselves as handicapped persons to avail themselves of benefits of this
policy.
   (h)   Veterans and Disabled Veterans.  Special provisions relate to disabled
veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era pursuant to the 1977 Veterans
Readjustment Act.
      (1)   Special care will be taken to ensure that employment criteria are
job related and do not needlessly have the effect of excluding disabled
veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era from being considered.
      (2)   The City will make reasonable accommodations for the disabled
veteran in the same manner and on the same criteria on which it does for
handicapped employees and applicants.
      (3)   In offering employment or promotions to disabled veterans and
veterans of the Vietnam era, the City will not reduce the amount of
compensation offered as payment for work because of any disability income,
pension, or other benefit the applicant or employee receives from any other
source.
      (4)   All employees and applicants for employment are given opportunity
to identify themselves as disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era in
order to avail themselves of benefits of this policy.
   (i)   Enforcement.  The Civil Service Commission acting as the City's Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, is hereby authorized to promulgate rules
necessary to carry out the spirit, intent and effectiveness of this policy.
(Ord. 169-1991.  Passed 1-9-92)
149.04  MERIT PAY PLAN FOR CITY EMPLOYEES IN NONCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT
POSITIONS.
   (a)   The Merit Pay Plan.
      (1)   The Merit Pay Plan is based on an appraisal process which consists
of three basic components:  a written evaluation completed by both the
supervisor and the employee; performance based discussion between the
supervisor and employee, and a quantitative summary of the final evaluation. 
The Supervisors should review all performance appraisals with his/her
appointing authority.  Department of Administration should be consulted when
the employee is rated above or below expectations.
      (2)   The formal Performance Appraisal process is to be conducted
annually in November.
      (3)   Merit pay will be calculated on the basis of the evaluation
completed by the supervisors and will be effective January 1 of the new year.
      (4)   Eligible employees will consist of full and part-time employees in
nonbargaining positions who have been in their position for at least one year.
      (5)   If an employee is not eligible for a merit pay award in January due
to the fact that he/she has not completed a year of service, the employee will
be eligible for a merit pay adjustment on his/her first anniversary date. 
After this, the employee will participate in the regularly scheduled merit pay
program.
      (6)   Elected officials, intermittent, special and seasonal employees are
not eligible for merit pay increases.  Their increases will be based off of the
annual wage adjustment approved by Council.
      (7)   Any employee who is a member of a union is not eligible for merit
pay.
   (b)   The Performance Appraisal Process.
      (1)   The appraisal process will begin with the supervisor and the
employee each completing a performance form for the employee.  Each will
complete the written form within one week of receiving it.  By November 30,
supervisors are required to forward their evaluations to their appointing
authority.  Each evaluation completed by a supervisor will be reviewed by his/
her appointing authority for the purpose of ensuring consistency and fairness
in evaluations.  If an appointing authority feels that a supervisor’s
evaluations reveal inconsistencies, the appointing authority retains the right
to challenge the supervisor’s evaluations.  The supervisor and employee will
then meet with the purpose of discussing their evaluations, discuss both
positive and negative aspects of the employee’s performance to identify and
resolve areas of agreement/disagreement and set goals for future performance. 
The employee should be encouraged to present his/her viewpoint and the
supervisor retains the right to choose whether to modify his/her rating based
on the employee’s input.
      (2)   If an employee feels aggrieved by the evaluation process, he/she
has the right to present a written appeal to the Department of Administration. 
In conjunction with the appointing authority, the Department of Administration
will schedule a hearing with the employee and supervisor for both parties to
present their issues, and the appointing authority will determine the outcome
of the hearing.
      (3)   When the appointing authorities have reviewed the evaluations to
ensure consistency and fairness, they should be given to the Department of
Administration.  The Finance office will then be notified of any increases to
be awarded.
   (c)   The Performance Appraisal Form.
      (1)   The performance appraisal process begins with a written evaluation
which is based on a detailed review of job performance.  The form consists of
two parts.
         A.   The General Performance Factors.  The factors include the
following:
            1.   Quality of Work.
            2.   Quantity of Work.
            3.   Cooperation/Team Work.
            4.   Job Knowledge.
            5.   Dependability.
            6.   Communication.
            7.   Judgement/Problem Solving.
            8.   Initiative.
            9.   Knowledge of Department Policy and Objectives.
            10.   Adhering to Safety Procedures.
            11.   Attendance/Tardiness.
         B.   The Special Factors.  The second part consists of Special
Performance Factors which represent critical areas of performance unique to
each position.  The Special Factors are different for each position, although
there may be some overlap between similar jobs to incorporate some consistency
in the form.  The employee and the supervisor developed the factors with
guidance from Human Resources.
   (d)   Merit Pay Calculations.
      (1)   The two parts of the form will have equal value in the quantitative
summary of the evaluation.  The general factors and the special factors will be
added together and divided by the total numbers of factors available.
      (2)   Merit pay increases will be calculated on the following scale using
the annual wage adjustment approved by Council as the base for all
calculations.
         A.   1.0-2.5 rating will receive 0% of the Wage Adjustment.

also issue a Certificate of Registration, which the contractor shall file with
the Building Department. Failure to possess a valid Certificate shall be cause
for suspension of work by the Building Department and/or the Tax Administrator
prior to the construction work commencing and/or during the performance of the
construction work. Proof of possession of a valid Certificate shall be
necessary to commence or resume suspended construction work. The Certificate of
Registration may be revoked by the Tax Administrator for failure by the
contractor to remain current in the filing of required payment of taxes,
reporting withholding, and for failure to otherwise comply with this Chapter. 
All employers that provide any contractual service within the City, and who
employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service shall, prior to
commencement of the service, provide the City the names and addresses of the
subcontractors.  The subcontractors shall be responsible for all income tax
employer requirements under this Chapter.
   (f)   Any business, profession, association, corporation, or other entities
reporting a net loss is subject to the filing requirements of this Chapter.

supervision or charged with the responsibility of making the return and/or
payment (including any tax, penalties, or interest due as required herein),
shall be personally liable for failure to do so.  The dissolution, bankruptcy
or reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to make the return
and/or or pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (h)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
181.11 and
181.15.  The amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Administrator.  A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e.,
cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing
the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, the taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon the final determination of federal tax liability and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
         (Ord. 13-2007.  Passed 1-25-07.)
181.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City of Tallmadge
who employs one or more persons shall, at the time of the payment thereto,
without regard to any alleged credit, deduction, or exemption available under
local, state, or federal statute, deduct the amount of tax due based upon the
rate in effect at that time from the qualifying wages, commissions, income, or
other compensation earned by the City of Tallmadge residents, regardless of
where such compensation was earned, and shall deduct the amount of tax due
based upon the rate in effect at the time of payment from the qualifying wages,
commissions, income, or other compensation earned within the City of Tallmadge
by nonresidents.  For purposes of calculating taxes to be withheld from
nonresident employees, the employer shall determine the amount of gross wages
and other compensation allocable to the City of Tallmadge pursuant to Ohio R.C.
718.02.  The employer shall consistently allocate the employer's gross income
in the same manner.  This determination shall be prima facie evidence of where
the taxpayer-employee's compensation was earned and may be rebutted only upon
submission of tax returns filed in other jurisdictions or such other evidence
satisfactory to the Tax Administrator.  The withheld tax shall be remitted as
follows:
      (1)   Quarterly payments of tax withheld are required if the total amount
of tax withheld by an employer in the prior calendar year averaged less than
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.
      (2)   Monthly payments of tax withheld are required if the average amount
of tax withheld by an employer in the prior calendar year is equal to or
greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month, but does not exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per month.
      (3)   Semimonthly payments of tax withheld are required if the average
amount of tax withheld by an employer in the prior calendar year exceeds one
thousand dollars ($1000.00) per month.  At the discretion of the taxpayer,
payments may be submitted more frequently than semimonthly.
(Ord. 13-2007.  Passed 1-25-07.)
   (b)   Every employer, in collecting said tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the City of Tallmadge as a
Trustee for the benefit of the City of Tallmadge.  Any such tax collected by
such employer from its employees shall, until the same is paid to the City of
Tallmadge, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
      (1)   Subject to rules of the Tax Administrator, every employer required
to deduct and withhold any amount under this chapter shall make payment by
electronic funds transfer or by election to pay through the Ohio Business
Gateway (OBG), subject to subsection (b)(4) below.
      (2)   The payment of taxes by electronic funds transfer or through the
OBG does not affect an employer’s obligation to file the returns as required
under this chapter.  The Tax Administrator may adopt rules governing the format
for filing the returns under this section by employers who remit undeposited
taxes by electronic funds transfer or through the OBG.  The rules may permit
the filing of returns at less frequent intervals than required hereunder if the
Tax Administrator determines that remittance by electronic funds transfer or
through the OBG warrants less frequent filing of returns.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall adopt rules governing the remittance of
taxes by electronic funds transfer as required under this chapter.  The rules
shall govern the modes of electronic funds transfer and under what
circumstances each mode is acceptable, the content and format of electronic
funds transfers, the coordination by payment of electronic funds transfer, and
the filing of associated tax reports and returns, and any other related matter
that in the discretion of the Tax Administrator, facilitates payment by
electronic funds transfer.
      (4)   The Tax Administrator may grant an exemption to an employer from
the duty to make payment by electronic funds transfer based upon a
demonstration of substantial hardship to the employer.  Additionally, the Tax
Administrator may establish a priority of electronic payors based upon the
number of employees or the utilization third party payroll administrators in
order to phase in this requirement.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator may implement a means of acknowledging, upon
request of a taxpayer, receipt of tax remittances made by electronic funds
transfer, and may adapt rules governing acknowledgments.  The cost of
acknowledging receipt of electronic remittances shall be paid by the person
requesting acknowledgment.
         (Ord. 17-2008.  Passed 2-14-08.)
   (c)   Such returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefore by the Tax Administrator.  Such employer shall be liable
for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld.
 
   (d)   The officer or employee having control or supervision, or charged with
the responsibility of withholding the tax, filing the return and/or making the
payment, shall be personally liable for the failure to file the return or pay
the tax due as required herein.  The dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization
of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or employee's liability
for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes due.
   (e)   (1)   On or before February 28 of each year, each employer shall file
a withholding return setting forth the name, address, and social security
number of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during the
preceding calendar year and the amount of tax withheld from his employees and
such other information as may be required by the Tax administrator.
      (2)   On or before February 28 of each year all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or others who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (i.e., those who are not
subject to withholding) must provide the Tax Administrator with copies of all
1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses, Social
Security numbers and a total amount of earnings, payments, bonuses, commissions
and/or fees paid to each person.

   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized employee, is hereby

   (a)   All taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties.  All additional assessments shall be made and all
actions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon
shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later.  However, In the case of fraud, omission of 25% or
more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all additional
assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to recover Municipal income
taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within six (6) years
after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. In those
cases in which a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have

which all additional assessment may be made by the Tax Administrator shall be
one (1) year from the time of the final determination of the federal tax
liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three (3) years from the date that such payment was made or the
return was due or within three (3) months after final determination of the
federal tax liability, whichever is later.  In addition, the following shall
apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified deferred
compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP.  The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP.  If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee’s
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Tallmadge, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Tallmadge as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.  Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of
Tallmadge, but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to
recovery by the City of Tallmadge.  The City of Tallmadge will allow a non-
refundable credit for any amount owed the City of Tallmadge that is in excess
of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate
of the other municipality is the same or higher than the City of Tallmadge tax
rate.  If the City of Tallmadge tax rate is higher, the tax representing the
net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by the City of
Tallmadge.

be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter in the amount so
paid by him or on his behalf to such other municipality or joint economic
development district. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this
Chapter on such taxable income earned in such other municipality or
municipalities or joint economic development districts where such tax is paid.

manner as the Tax Administrator may by regulation provide.

in Section
182.03 and other sections as they may apply.
      (2)     In addition to the tax levied in Section
182.01(B)(1), the annual tax is levied at an additional rate of .25% (one-

qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, and on net profits as
hereinafter provided in Section

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the

alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period

   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing

which withholding is not required under Section
182.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.03 of this chapter.  An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer

employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays

   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or
the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent,
or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the total
amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld
on behalf of City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
      Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the
Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for
which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator

calendar quarter.
         (c)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (B)(1)(a)and (b) of

semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of City in the preceding

year exceeded $1,000.  Payment under division (B)(1)(c) of this section shall

before the first day of the immediately following month, the third banking day
after the last day of the month.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for City until such time as the withheld amount
is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for City during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;

      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in City.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in City
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in City than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For
the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to City for any subsequent days in that calendar year on
which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for City under
division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for City for the
first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in City.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is City and the employer qualifies
as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to City,
regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement

The extended due date of City's income tax return shall be the 15th day of the

subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)     If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)

income tax return, report, or document required by City, provided that the

the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to City's income
tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a
consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The
election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable
year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown. 
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City income
tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax return
for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated or
combined tax return with City may continue to file consolidated or combined tax
returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable years
beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 104-2017.  Passed 1-25-18.)
182.06  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in City who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality.  Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due City under this chapter. 
   (B)     City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident of
City who works in a joint economic development zone created under Section
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit against
its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation.
   (C)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
   (D)     Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for City's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to City for the taxable
year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and after
applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from another
taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
182.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to City, including the
application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before the
applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
City under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

182.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds

to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
182.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4).

182.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with City, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by City as a refund but is
subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with City is subject to recovery by City.  If City's tax on
that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality, City shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding City claims is due with respect to such
income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality
with respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using City's
tax rate.  However, if City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the
other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be
paid to City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the
period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with City.
The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
182.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by City. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to City
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

182.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by City does not prejudice any claim
for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to City that arises pursuant to City's income tax imposed in accordance with
this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of City as authorized
by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may furnish copies
of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the internal revenue service, the tax commissioner, and tax
administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City ordinance or state law to be
filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud City or the Tax Administrator.

      (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,
schedule, and other document required to be filed with a the Tax Administrator
or City by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer

   (B)   (1)    This section applies to the following:
         (a)    Any return required to be filed under applicable law for
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to City on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fail, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

imposed or collected before January 1, 2016.

attorney's fees.
(Ord. 104-2017.  Passed 1-25-18.)
182.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)     Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.

be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or

withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that

show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits  the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
182.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.  Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

any time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date
of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Director of Finance of

administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC. 
(Ord. 64-2015.  Passed 10-8-15.)
182.22  AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of City,
or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the administrator by
resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an income tax imposed by
City in accordance with this chapter. Such rules shall not conflict with or be
inconsistent with any provision of this chapter. Taxpayers are hereby required
to comply not only with the requirements of this chapter, but also to comply
with the Rules and Regulations.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.

natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor

one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in

   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with  which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.

the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the

owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into  storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:

required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability

considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
               The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program.  The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may
impose on the offender any other conditions of community control that it
considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education  programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose
any other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars

The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term
under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term

monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The

unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The

court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by  subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be marked by a

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

have more than one valid license at any time.

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty

   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

353.01  DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)    "Parking meter" means a mechanical device installed for the
regulation of parking by lawful authority.  Each parking meter shall contain a
slot for the deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for
receiving and storing such coin.  Each parking meter shall display brief
directions as to its operation and the value of lawful coin required to be
deposited.  Each parking meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall
indicate either a balance of legal parking time or overtime parking by an
appropriate signal at the expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter.  Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02  PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.
   No person shall park a vehicle in a parking meter space in such a way that
the vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated
by marked lines.
353.03  DEPOSIT OF COIN REQUIRED; ILLEGAL PARKING.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a parking meter
space during the hours when the provisions applicable to such space are in
effect, unless he shall deposit such lawful coin of the United States of
appropriate denomination in the adjacent parking meter, as required by
directions on the meter.  Such person is not required to deposit coin in a
meter which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the
previous occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not
exceed the indicated unused parking time.  The parking meter space may be
lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time
shown on the meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established
maximum time limit.
   No person shall fail to comply with directions displayed on the parking
meter or fail to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a meter space
beyond the maximum consecutive parking time limit lawfully prescribed, for the
particular space occupied, by appropriate notice on the meter or on posted
signs, irrespective of the number or amount of coin deposited in such meter.
353.04  PARKING PROHIBITED IN METER SPACE.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, no person shall park in a
parking meter space when otherwise directed by a police officer or fireman or
when parking is prohibited by properly posted signs.

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.   
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person who is convicted of an offense under any section of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of Tallmadge or any section of the Ohio Revised
Code, other than a minor misdemeanor, and who is sentenced to and imprisoned in
the Summit, Medina or Portage County Jail, or other facility shall reimburse
the City of Tallmadge for its expenses incurred by reason of the prisoner’s
confinement to the extent allowed by Ohio R.C. 2929.223.
   (b)   The duty to reimburse the City shall include all expenses incurred by
the City, including but not limited to food, clothing, shelter, medical and/or
psychiatric care, personal hygiene items and payments made to the Summit County
or other governmental body for such confinement.  Chargeable costs shall also
include any period of incarceration before sentencing that is credited against
the term of imprisonment and up to two hours of overtime costs the City
incurred relating to the trial of the person.
   (c)   In any proceeding which is subject to this section, the Director of
Law shall apply to the sentencing judge or magistrate for a determination, or
the sentencing judge or magistrate may, on his own motion proceed to make a
determination of the extent of the individual’s duty to reimburse the City for
its expenses in confining him, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.223.  However, the
maximum amount permitted by Ohio R.C. 2929.223 shall not apply.  The actual
amount to be paid shall not exceed the actual costs of confinement.  The
Prosecutor shall notify the Clerk of Courts in all cases where the sentencing
judge or magistrate determines the individual has a duty to reimburse the City,
and shall include the amount so ordered to be paid in such notice.
   (d)   The Police Chief shall maintain records of expenses chargeable to each
prisoner, in accordance with a reasonable computation of the per capita cost of
maintaining such prisoner, in addition to specific expense incurred on behalf
of each prisoner.  Upon each prisoner’s release, the Police Chief shall prepare
a statement of such expense, and, in the event such expense equals or exceeds
fifty dollars ($50.00), he shall cause such statement to be transmitted to the
Director of Law.
   (e)   Upon receipt of both a statement which indicates a total expense of
fifty dollars ($50.00) or more from the Police Department as to any individual
formerly incarcerated, the Director of Law shall then apply to the court for
the reimbursement if not previously ordered.  The Clerk may, in his discretion,
accept partial payments, or permit individuals to make periodic payments. 
Whenever the Clerk uses his own staff to collect such payments, bills may be
sent by regular mail, and upon passage of thirty days from their being sent, if
no acceptable response is made, the Clerk shall refer such matters to the City
of Tallmadge Law Department for further collection efforts.
   (f)   The Clerk shall also refer matters to the Law Department for
additional collection efforts where an individual fails to satisfactorily
complete a payment plan or where a private collection agency has been unable to
collect costs in matters referred to it.  The Director of Law in all matters
referred to him, shall determine the most appropriate procedure for collecting
such unpaid expenses.  All moneys collected pursuant to this section shall be
placed only in the General Fund of the City.
(Ord. 134-1998.  Passed 1-28-99.)

prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred

relay service call.

source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

program of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in
danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.
5119.36.

violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05 or to victims of felonious sexual
penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12.  As used in this
subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of

opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.
   (h)   "Nudity" means the showing, representation or depiction of human male

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and
quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2909.11)
541.02  ARSON.
   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;

726.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose.  That the purpose of this Chapter is to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative effects of
amusement arcades within the City in order to promote the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the City.  It is not the purpose or intent of this
Chapter to restrict or deny access to recreational and skilled-based amusement
machines.
   (b)   Findings. 
      (1)   The State of Ohio currently allows certain games of skill while
games of chance are deemed illegal.  Based upon experience within the City,
certain arcades identified as operating games of skill, have generated various
complaints by citizens involving thefts, questionable pay practices,
considerable sums of cash being transacted, food management concerns, fire code
and access, and other issues of compliance with local and state laws. 
      (2)   These businesses are located throughout the City in general
business districts, in areas which attract adults and children.  It is the
specific finding that games of skill operated electronically, may easily be
altered to illegal games of chance.  Further, that the City has a duty to its
citizens to require businesses open to the public to maintain safe ingress and
egress, to maintain adequate security where a considerable volume of cash is
transacted, and to otherwise operate within the bounds of the law.
(Ord. 50-2006.  Passed 9-14-06.)

760.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose.  That the purpose of this Chapter is to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City.  The provisions of this
Chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication,
including sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or
effect of this Chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market.  Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this Chapter
to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that
is obscene.
   (b)   Findings.  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before
the Council; on findings incorporated in the cases of the City of Renton v.
Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters,
427 U.S. 50 (1976); and on studies in other cities including New York, New
York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; along with Manatee
County, Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina; and the State of
Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented
entertainment.  Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in paragraphs number 1 through 5 raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses.  Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City.  It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex- related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors and/or curtains on viewing booths in sexually
oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing
booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the
illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters
and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other
federal, state, and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental
interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal activity
on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state, and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state, and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (13)    A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business or adult motel.
      (14)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
         (Ord. 87-1999.  Passed 11-11-99.)

of this section, then the sexually oriented business license issued pursuant to

issuance of a license, the Director of Public Safety receives information
concerning the results of inspections of the premises by the Fire Chief or the

determines constitutes grounds for the issuance of a license subject to a
requirement to correct deficiencies under subparagraph (g) of this section,
then a requirement shall be added to the terms of the sexually oriented
business licenses issued pursuant to this subparagraph (h) to correct all
deficiencies noted within 120 days of the date such requirement is added.
   (i)   A sexually oriented business license, if granted, shall state on its
face the name of the person or persons to whom it is granted, the expiration
date, the address of the licensed sexually oriented business or adult motel,
and the classification for which the license is issued pursuant to Section
760.03 of this chapter.  All sexually oriented business licenses shall be
posted in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the business so that
they may be easily read at any time.
   (j)   The Director of Public Safety shall advise the applicant in writing of
the reasons for any license denial.

   (b)   Such Adult Business Licensing Appeals Board shall consist of five (5)
residents of the City, appointed by the Mayor, for terms of four years.  Such

action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (d)   In the event that an applicant or licensee seeks judicial review of a
decision issued pursuant to this Ordinance, the applicant or licensee shall

notice of appeal, or within such shorter time as may be ordered by the court,
the Board shall transmit to the court in which appeal was sought a copy of the

cooperation requested by the reviewing court within 72 hours of such request.
   (e)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, any

of a license, may continue to operate said business during the pendency of an
appeal of a decision rendered under this Board or to a court.
   (f)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, any
licensee lawfully acting as an employee in a sexually oriented business or
adult motel prior to the denial of a license renewal application, or the
suspension or revocation of a license, may continue to serve in such capacity

a court.
   (g)   In the event that an applicant for a new sexually oriented business
license or a new sexually oriented business employee license seeks judicial
review of the denial of a new license, and such review does not result in a
final judicial decision within thirty (30) days of the date the appeal was
filed, the City shall issue such applicant a provisional sexually oriented
business license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of
the applicant.  The provisional license:
      (1)   Allows an applicant for a sexually oriented business license to
operate the sexually oriented business or adult motel named in the license
application under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business issued
pursuant to Section
760.07 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subparagraph (h) of
this section; and
      (2)   Allows an applicant for a sexually oriented business employee
license to act as an employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business
or adult motel under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business
employee license issued pursuant to Section
760.09 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subparagraph (h) of
this section; and
      (3)   Allows an applicant to be subject to the same requirements as a
normal sexually oriented business license or sexually oriented business
employee license issued under Section
760.07 or Section
760.09 of this chapter.
   (h)   A provisional license will expire on whichever of the following three
dates is earliest:
      (1)   The date that a judicial decision is issued upholding the license
denial;
      (2)   The date on which a non-provisional sexually oriented business
license or sexually oriented business employee license is issued to the
applicant pursuant to a judicial decision overturning the license denial; or
      (3)   The date one year from the issuance of the provisional license.
   (i)   In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Safety Director pursuant to Section
760.12(b) of this chapter.  The Safety Director shall grant an application for
renewal of a provisional license unless he determines that new grounds exist
for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
760.07 or Section
760.09 of this chapter, which did not exist at the time of the original license
application.  In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the
City has the right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial appeal
of the previous license denial.

the Director of Public Safety within fifteen (15) days of such transfer.

motel as that term is defined in Section
760.02 of this chapter.
   (c)   Evidence that a person in control of a sleeping room in a hotel,
motel, or similar commercial establishment has rented or subrented a sleeping

905.01  OPENINGS; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, firm or corporation shall make any opening or excavation in any
street, highway, alley, sidewalk or public way or cut into any curb within the
City unless a permit to make such opening or cutting shall have been obtained
prior to commencement of the work, as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 177-1963.  Passed 12-19-63.)
905.02  APPLICATION; DEPOSIT.
   Each permit for making such opening or curb cutting shall be confined to a
single project and shall be issued by the Service Director or other proper
administrative officer.  Application shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Director, giving the exact location of the proposed opening or cutting; the
kind of paving, the area and depth to be excavated and such other facts as the
Director may deem necessary.  The permit shall be issued only after a cash
deposit or bond sufficient to cover the cost of restoration, as determined by
the Director, has been deposited with the Director, conditioned upon prompt and
satisfactory refilling of excavations and restoration of all surfaces or curbs
disturbed.  The fee for such permit, payable prior to issuance of the permit,
shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) plus an hourly rate for field inspection to be
set at time of application.
(Ord.  57-2001.  Passed 5-24-01.)
905.03  WAIVER OF DEPOSIT.
   The requirements of Section
905.02 shall be waived insofar as public utilities doing their own work with
employees of such utilities on the streets, highways, alleys, sidewalks or any
portion thereof or on any other property of the City that may be involved. 
This waiver, however, shall not apply when the work is being done by private
contractors under contract to the utilities.
(Ord. 27-1957.  Passed 3-15-57.)
905.04  RETURN OF DEPOSIT.
   The bond or deposit posted in accordance with Section

Director has certified to the Director of Finance that the street, highway,
alley, sidewalk or public way has been restored to its original condition,
including the grades previously established or such new grades as may be
lawfully established. 
(Ord. 104-1956.  Passed 1-10-57.)

(Ord. 177-1963.  Passed 12-19-63.)
905.06  METHOD OF OPENING STREET; TUNNELING.
   In opening any street or public way all materials for paving and ballasting
must be removed with the least possible injury or loss of the same and,
together with excavated material from the trench, must be placed where they
will cause the least practicable inconvenience to the public.  As little as
possible of the trench shall be dug until the junction piece in the water or
sewer line is found, unless it is first determined that a new opening into the
line be made.  Whenever the sides of the trenches will not stand perpendicular
sheeting, braces must be used to prevent unnecessary caving, and in no case
shall the work be done by tunneling, unless authorized and directed by the
Service Director.
(Ord. 177-1963.  Passed 12-19-63.)
905.07  BARRIERS AROUND EXCAVATIONS; WARNING LIGHTS.

precautions as shall be necessary to guard the public against accidents.  At
all times the work shall be done as to cause the least inconvenience to the
property owners and the general public.
(Ord. 177-1963.  Passed 12-19-63.)
905.08  RESTORATION OF PAVEMENT.
   (a)   The restoration of pavement or other surface shall be performed under
the direction and to the satisfaction of the Service Director.
   (b)   The backfilling over the drains, sewers or other utility lines, after
they have been laid and accepted by the proper official, shall be done by hand
with fine material and tamped to a point one foot above the top of the utility
line or pipe.  Above this point, backfill shall be in layers not more than
eight inches thick and compacted by rolling or flushing or a combination of
both methods, as directed by the Service Director.  All paving which is removed
must be replaced within forty-eight hours after the completion of the work in
the excavation, unless instructed otherwise by the Director.  The restoration
shall be done so as to make the pavement at least as good as it was before it
was disturbed.  The contractor shall be responsible for any subsequent
settlement of the ground or pavement.  All water lines must be protected from
settlement or injury.  All gas lines, oil lines and telephone conduits shall be
protected.
   (c)   Upon failure or refusal of the permittee satisfactorily to fill the
excavation, restore the surface and remove all excess materials within the time
specified in the permit, or where not specified therein, within a reasonable
time after commencement of the work, the City may proceed without notice to
make such fill and restoration and the cost thereof shall be deducted from the
deposit posted under Section
905.02.  If the cost of such restoration should exceed the amount of such
deposit, the proper officer of the City shall proceed to collect the remainder
due from such permittee and no permit shall be subsequently granted until such
amounts are paid.

1109.04  MAJOR SUBDIVISION STAGES.
   Major subdivisions shall be approved in two stages:  preliminary plat stage
and final plat stage.
   (a)   The preliminary plat stage requires the subdivider to present all
information needed to enable the Planning Commission to determine that the
proposed layout is satisfactory and will serve the public interest.  This stage
also ensures that the subdivider will not be required to expend extensive
moneys without some assurance that his plat will be finally approved.
   (b)   The final plat stage requires the subdivider to present all data
needed to enable the Planning Commission to determine that the subdivision
fully complies with these regulations and conforms to the approved preliminary
plat.  After approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission and after
acceptance of all streets, highways or other public ways or open spaces, and
the acceptance of required bonds by Council, the plat may be recorded. 
Approved final plats that are not recorded within twelve months of the date of
approval by the Planning Commission shall be void.  The Commission may grant
one extension of six months to this requirement.

1113.01  PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   Natural Land Use.  Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of
the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading, and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)   Flood Hazard.  If any portion of the land within the subdivision is
subject to flooding or other hazards, due consideration shall be given to such
problems in the design of the subdivision.  While portions of a lot may be
within a flood prone area no residential occupancy, accessory buildings, nor
such other use that may increase danger to health, life or property, or
aggravate the hazard of flooding shall be permitted.  Further, defined flood
plains shall not be filled.  Flood plains are defined as shown on maps of the
City.  (Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)
1113.02  STREETS.
   (a)   Arrangement.  The arrangement, character, extent, width (sixty foot
minimum) and location of all streets shall conform to the Thoroughfare Plan. 
The design of proposed streets and public access to adjacent unplatted lands
shall be arranged so that the entire area can be served with a coordinated
public street system.  All streets must be built to City standards.  The width
of right of way should be provided so that all underground utilities can be
located outside of pavement areas.
   (b)   Street Classifications.
      (1)   Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for continuation of
movement of fast traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from
one section of the community to another.  They shall contain as few
intersections with minor streets as possible.  Such thoroughfares shall
traverse the community and should be spaced approximately one mile apart.
      (2)   Collector streets shall provide a traffic route from local streets
to major arterial thoroughfares.  Collector streets normally contain a
relatively large number of intersections with local streets and few
intersections with major arterial thoroughfares.
      (3)   Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot and
shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
The street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets shall be in
conformity with modern practices of land subdivision and in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood. 
The streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the tract to be recorded and
align with existing streets unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the planning authority, such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the development of adjacent tracts.  Dead-end streets or cul-
de-sacs will be approved only when necessitated by topography or other physical
conditions or where, in the opinion of the approving authority, they are
appropriate for the type of development contemplated.
      (4)   Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed
major arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such major arterial
thoroughfares.
   (c)   Street Right-of-Way Widths and Grades.

an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision in which case the remaining
half of the street shall be platted.
(Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)
   (f)   Cul-de-Sac and Dead-end Streets.
      (1)   Streets designed to be a permanent cul-de-sac should not be longer
than 800 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having
an outside pavement diameter of at least ninety feet and a street right-of-way
line diameter of at least 120 feet.
         (Ord. 133-1989.  Passed 11-9-89.)
      (2)   If a cul-de-sac is of a temporary nature and a future extension
into adjacent land is anticipated then such turning circle beyond the normal
street width shall be in the nature of an easement over the premises included
in the turning circle, but beyond the boundaries of the street proper.  Such
easements shall be automatically vacated to abutting property owners, when such
dead-end street is legally extended into adjacent land.  If such dead-end
street extends only the depth of the corner lot past a street intersection, no
turnaround will be required.
   (g)   Corner Radii.  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded
with a radius of not less than twenty-five feet for major arterial
thoroughfares, collector and industrial streets, and twenty feet for local
streets.  Chords or cutoffs may be permitted in place of rounded corners.
   (h)   Horizontal and Vertical Curves.  Angles in the alignment of street
lines shall be connected by a curve with a radius on the center line of not
less than 200 feet for local streets, 300 feet for collector and industrial
streets, and 500 for major arterial thoroughfares.  Between reverse curves
there shall be a tangent at least 100 feet long on major arterial
thoroughfares.
   (i)   Intersections.  Streets should be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle of less than sixty degrees.  In no event shall an intersection containing
streets in excess of two be approved.

feet shall be prohibited.  If deemed necessary by the Commission the minimum
distance between center line offsets may be increased.
   (k)   Names and Numbers of Streets. 
      (1)   Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing street names as
listed in the Ohio Bell Akron Metropolitan Telephone Book unless a new street
is a continuation of, or in alignment with the existing platted streets.
      (2)   House numbers shall be assigned in accordance with the house
numbering system now in effect in the City.  All new streets shall be named in
accordance with ordinance regulations of the City.
   (l)   Vacation of Streets.  The Planning Commission shall not recommend the
vacation of any street or part of a street dedicated for public use, if such
vacation interferes with the uniformity of the existing street pattern or any
future street plans prepared for the area. 
(Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)
            
1113.03  EASEMENTS.

way, a storm sewer or drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines
of such drainage way shall be provided.  The easement shall be a minimum of
twenty feet wide or wider as the Commission may require and shall generally
follow rear and side lot lines.  Easements for drainage purposes shall be
constructed or defined on the ground by the developer before the allotment plat
is accepted.  Instances where the water course is not presently channeled or
visible, the developer is required to define such water course by excavating or
grading.  The purpose of this procedure is to prevent future owners from
attempting to block the water course on the pretext that they had no knowledge
of such drainage easement. 
(Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)
1113.04  BLOCKS.
   (a)   Block Lengths.  The long dimension of a residential block shall not
exceed 1,500 feet or be less than 800 feet.
   (b)   Pedestrian Walkways. 
      (1)   Pedestrian walkways shall be provided in all subdivisions.  These
walkways shall be constructed at a width of not less than four feet and be
parallel to the constructed street.  Such walkways shall be provided on both
sides of a street.
      (2)   In addition, pedestrian easement ways, not less than twenty feet
wide and constructed to a width of not less than eight feet shall be required
across blocks where the Commission determines that pedestrian access to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community
facilities is necessary.
   (c)   Commercial or Industrial Blocks.  Blocks intended to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed specifically for such uses
with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading facilities.
(Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)

   (a)   Zoning Conformance.  The lot size, width, depth and the minimum
building setback lines shall conform to the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Corner Lots.  Corner lots shall have extra width to permit appropriate
building setback from and orientation to both streets.
   (c)   Access to Public Streets.  The subdividing of land shall provide each
lot with full frontage on a public street.

frontage on more than one street except:
      (1)   Where the lots are adjacent to the intersection of two streets.
      (2)   Where it is necessary to separate residential lots for major
arterial thoroughfares, a reserve strip along the major arterial thoroughfare
shall be deeded to the City.  The plat shall state that there shall be no right
of access across such reserve strip.  The Planning Commission may require that
a six foot high solid board fence or masonry wall be constructed or that a ten
foot wide planting screen be provided.
   (e)   Side Lot Lines.  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles
or radial to street lines.
   (f)   Lot Depth.  No lot depth shall exceed four times the lot width or be
less than one and one-half times the lot width, at the minimum building set-
back line. 
(Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)
1113.06  PUBLIC SITES.

and/or open space in an amount not less than five percent (5%) of the gross
area of the major residential subdivision to be developed for the development
of a neighborhood park system in accordance with the City’s open space plan. 
Such area shall not exceed ten acres.
   (b)   In lieu of dedication of land for open space or parks to the City,
such land may at the discretion of the Planning Commission, be held by the
developer or an approved association of home owners, which association shall be
substantial in ownership and duration.  The final plat shall be accompanied by
restrictions, agreements, and other documents indicating in detail the manner
in which any land intended for common or quasi-public use, but not proposed for
public ownership, will be held, owned, or maintained for the indicated
purpose. 
(Ord. 21-1996.  Passed 4-25-96.)
1113.07  DEED RESTRICTIONS.
   All deed restrictions shall run with the land and be enforceable by the
owner of any of the property lying within the subdivision.  Restrictions shall
be so written that they may be amended to meet changing conditions.  All
covenants and restrictions shall indicate the proposed use of the land.
(Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)
1113.08  NATURAL FEATURES.
   Due consideration shall be given to preserving outstanding natural features
such as scenic spots, water bodies, or exceptionally fine groves of trees. 
Dedication to and acceptance by a public agency is usually the best means of
assuring their preservation.
(Ord. 107-78.  Passed 11-9-78.)

1137.01  VARIANCES.
   When practical difficulties, unnecessary hardship, or results inconsistent
with the general purpose of this Zoning Code result through the strict and
literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions hereof, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall have authority, as an administrative act, subject to the
provisions of this section, to grant, upon such conditions as it may determine,
such variances from the provisions of this Zoning Code as may be in harmony
with its general purpose and intent, so that the spirit of this Zoning Code
shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice
done.
   (a)   In every instance of granting a variance by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, there must be a showing by the Board that:
      (1)   The strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Code would
result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the
general purpose and intent of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property involved or to the intended use or development of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same
zoning district or neighborhood.
      (3)   The granting of such variance will not be of substantial detriment
to the public interest or to property or improvements in such district in which
the variance is sought, and will not materially impair the purpose of this
Zoning Code.
   (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals has no authority to authorize a change in
the use of any parcel of land.
      (Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)

administrative official or the Planning and Zoning Commission in granting or
refusing to grant zoning permits.  Notice of Appeals shall be filed with the
Zoning Department within fifteen (15) days after the date of any adverse
decision except when the fifteenth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a

thereafter.  The appellant, except the City, shall post security for the cost
of all action required for the hearing of the appeal.  An appeal shall stay all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Planning and
Zoning Commission or administrative officer whose decision is appealed from
shall certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of the appeal has
been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such case,  proceedings shall not
be stayed by other than a restraining order granted by the Board of Zoning
Appeals or by a court having lawful jurisdiction.  Within its powers, the Board
of Zoning Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be done, and
to that end shall have all the powers of the officers from whom the appeal is
taken, and it may issue or direct the issuance of a permit or certificate.

Appeals.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall decide all such appeals within

   (a)   Prior to making a recommendation on a proposed rezoning, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall make a finding to determine if the following
conditions exist.  No rezoning of land shall be approved prior to specific
documents finding at least one (1) of the following:
      (1)   There has been a change in demand for land which alters the
information upon which the Zoning Map is based.
      (2)   A study indicates that there has been an increase in the demand for
land in the requested zoning district, and as a result, the supply of land
within the City of Tallmadge mapped as such on the Zoning Map, is inadequate to
meet the demands for such development.
      (3)   Proposed uses cannot be accommodated by sites already zoned in the
City due to lack of transportation or utilities or other development
constraints, or the market to be served by the proposed use cannot be
effectively served by the location of the existing zoning district.
      (4)   There is an error in the Code text or Zoning Map as enacted.
   (b)   In addition to the findings required to be made by subsection (b),
findings shall be made by the Planning and Zoning Commission on each of the
following matters based on the evidence presented:
      (1)   The extent to which the proposed amendment and proposed use are in
compliance with and deviate from adopted plans, goals and policies.
      (2)   The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted
under the proposed zoning.
      (3)   The adequacy of public facilities such as transportation,
utilities, and other required public services to serve the proposed use.
      (4)   The effect of the proposed rezoning on surrounding uses.
      (5)   The effect of the proposed rezoning on the economic viability of 
existing developed and vacant land within the City.
      (6)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the same area;
      (7)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (8)   Will not be detrimental to property in the immediate vicinity or to
the community as a whole;
      (9)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such service;
      (10)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets or roads.
      (11)   Limitations upon financial gain from the land in question shall
not be sufficient to constitute unreasonable zoning.
      (12)   Evidence must support that the proposed amendment would
materialize in a better land use.

      (Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)
1141.03  SITE PLAN REVIEW GUIDELINES.
   The following principles shall guide the exercise of site planning review by
the Planning and Zoning Commission:
   (a)   The natural topographic and landscape features of the site shall be 
incorporated into the plan and the development.
   (b)   Buildings and open spaces should be in proportion and in scale with
existing structures and spaces in the area within three hundred (300) feet of
the development site.
   (c)   A site that has an appearance of being congested, over built or
cluttered can evolve into a blighting influence and therefore such should not
be congested, over built or cluttered.
   (d)   Open spaces should be linked together.
   (e)   Natural separation should be preserved or created on the site by
careful planning of the streets and clustering of buildings using natural
features and open spaces for separation.  Existing vegetation removal should be
kept to a minimum.
   (f)   Screening of intensive uses should be provided by utilizing
landscaping, fences or walls to enclose internal areas.
   (g)   Buildings should be sited in an orderly, non-random fashion.  Long,
unbroken building facades should be avoided.
   (h)   In connection with the siting of multiple story buildings, the
location should be oriented to maximize the privacy of the occupants of
adjacent buildings.
    (i)   Pedestrian circulation in non-residential areas should be arranged so
that off-street parking areas are located within a convenient walking distance
of the use being served.  Handicapped parking should be located as near as
possible to be accessible to the structure.  Pedestrian and vehicular
circulation should be separated as much as possible, through crosswalks
designated by pavement markings, signalization or complete grade separation.
   (j)   Path and sidewalk street crossings should be located where there is a
good sight distance along the road, preferably away from sharp bends or sudden
changes in grade.
   (k)   Parking lots and garages should be located in such a way as to provide
safe, convenient ingress and egress. Whenever possible there should be a
sharing of curb cuts of more than one facility.  Parking areas should be
screened and landscaped and traffic islands should be provided to protect
circulating vehicles and to break up the monotony of continuously paved areas.
   (l)   Drive through establishments such as restaurants and banks should be
located to allow enough automobile waiting space for peak hour operation
without interference with other parking lot circulations.
      (Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)
1141.04  ACTION BY PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION FOR SITE PLAN  REVIEW.
   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall act upon all site plans within
thirty-five (35) days after the receipt of the complete application from the
Zoning Inspector .  The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve, disapprove
or approve with modifications the site plan as submitted. The Planning and
Zoning Commission may extend the time for review with the consent of the
applicant.

   Except where referenced on the map to a street or alley line or other
designated line by dimensions shown on the map, the district boundary lines
follow lot lines or the center lines of streets or alleys as they existed at
the time of adoption of this Chapter, but where a district line obviously does
not coincide with the lot lines as such, or center lines of streets or alleys,
or where it is not designated by dimensions, it shall be determined by the use
of the engineer's scale as measured on the Official Zoning Map.
(Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)
1151.04  LOT DIVIDED, EXTENSION OF DISTRICT.
   Where a district  boundary line established in this section or as shown on
the Zoning Map divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of
enactment of this Chapter, the use authorized thereon and the other district 
requirements applying to the more restricted portion of such lot under this
Chapter shall be considered as extending to the entire lot.
(Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)
1151.05  UNCERTAINTY AS TO BOUNDARIES.

1151.06  VACATED STREET OR ALLEY.
   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official
action as provided by law, the zoning district adjoining the side of such
public way shall be extended automatically, depending on the side or sides to
which such lands revert, to include the right-of-way thus vacated, which shall
thenceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended district.
(Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)

(Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)
1151.08  CONFORMANCE WITH REGULATIONS.
   Except as hereinafter specified, no land, building, structure, or premises,

1160.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   Purpose.  The R-6 Residential Open Space Planned Development District
(ROSPDD) regulations are based on the premise that the ultimate quality of a
built environment or development proposal is determined not only by the type,
character and allocation of land uses, but also by the way in which such land
uses are arranged.  In many cases, the subdivision regulations and standard
zoning district regulations and procedures do not adequately regulate the
development of a site or the design flexibility that are appropriate for
portions of the City of Tallmadge.
   Therefore, the specific purposes of the R-6 ROSPDD regulations are to:
      (1)   Provide an opportunity for creative and flexible arrangement and
mix of single family homes that is not permitted within the standard municipal
zoning district classifications.
      (2)   Better preserve sensitive environmental features, agricultural and
farmlands, by avoiding development on these unique natural areas.
      (3)   Promote development that respects the unique characteristics,
natural quality and beauty, and rural characteristics of the site and the
immediate vicinity.
      (4)   Enable greater development plan review to ensure that the
development preserves natural features, is properly integrated into its
surroundings and is compatible with adjacent development.
      (5)   Implement the housing and economic development goals of the City.
      (6)   Promote economical and efficient use of land and reduce
infrastructure costs through unified development.
      (7)   Establish objective standards and criteria for plan review that
ensures conformity to community standards.
         (Ord. 43-2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)
1160.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF AN R-6 RESIDENTIAL OPEN SPACE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT
DISTRICT.
   (a)   Application.  The purposes of the Residential Open Space Planned
Development District are achieved by establishing review process that combines
the request for a zoning amendment with the concurrent development plan review,
and when applicable, the subdivision process.  Therefore:
      (1)   Each Residential Open Space Planned Development District shall be
considered a separate and unique zoning district wherein a General Development
Plan, including associated text, depicting the specific development standards
and development commitments, is adopted simultaneously with the adoption of the
Residential Open Space Planned Development District zoning map amendment. 
      (2)   The General Development Plan adopted at the time of rezoning to the
Residential Open Space Planned Development District shall be prepared in
accordance with the provisions and shall take precedence over any conflicting
regulations contained in the Tallmadge Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)   Ownership.  The Residential Open Space Planned Development District
shall be an integrated, unified development project and the entire project area
shall be in single ownership or joint ownership and/or control at the time the
application is made for the District designation so that all property owners
are applicants.  Any transfer of ownership for any portion of the land within
the development resulting in ownership by two or more parties, after an
application has been filed, shall not alter the applicability of the
regulations contained herein. A General Development Plan approved in accordance
with these regulations for a Residential Open Space Planned Development
District shall be binding upon the owners, their successors and assigns.
   (c)   All zoning amendments to an R-6 Residential Open Space Planned
Development District shall be designated on the Zoning Map as an R-6 ROSPDD.
   (d)   Detailed Final Development Plans shall be reviewed and acted upon by
the Planning Commission according to Section
1160.12.
   (e)   A preliminary subdivision plat may be reviewed simultaneously with a
General Development Plan. A final subdivision plat shall be reviewed
simultaneously with a Final Development Plan, unless a final plat is not
required for completion of the project.  All subdivision plats shall be
reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission according to Chapter
1109, Procedure for Subdivision Approval.
(Ord. 43-2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)
1160.03  MINIMUM PROJECT AREA.
   The gross area of a tract of land proposed for development under the
Residential Open Space Planned Development District regulations shall be a
minimum of thirty (30) contiguous acres that is not separated by an existing
public street right-of-way.
(Ord. 43-2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)
1160.04  DWELLING TYPES AND PERMITTED LAND USES.
   The dwelling types that are permitted within an R-6 ROSPDD are:
   (a)   Single-Family Residential Detached Dwellings.
   (b)   Accessory Uses which shall include:
      (1)   Community buildings, recreational facilities, fences, signs, and
etc.
      (2)   Any use, building or structure which is clearly incidental to the
principally permitted use on the lot.

      (4)   Accumulative area for all accessory buildings shall not exceed 900
sq. ft.  Accumulative area of all accessory buildings located within the rear
yard shall not exceed 20% of the rear yard area.  For computing the
accumulative area, if a detached accessory building is connected to the
principal building by a breezeway or other similar structure, the ground area
of such breezeway shall be considered as a part of the accessory building and
shall be included in the computation.
(Ord. 86-2011.  Passed 11-10-11.)
1160.05  DENSITY.
   An R-6 ROSPDD shall not exceed two (2) units per acre based on the gross
area of the parcel rounded up to the next highest dwelling unit.  The maximum
density on any single acre shall not exceed six (6) units.  The maximum density
for any single acre is measured by superimposing an imaginary square template,
approximately 209 feet by 209 feet, over any one-acre of the site.  (Ord. 43-
2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)
1160.06  OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.

considered as common open space (see also Section
1160.07).
   (b)   To the extent possible, the common open space areas shall be
interconnected within the development and to adjacent parcels, and shall be
easily accessible to residents of the Development.  If the common open space

public thoroughfares.
      (4)   Historic structures or buildings.  Buildings or structures with
significant historic meaning or traditional meaning that pertains to the area's
history, such as barns, mills, etc. shall be preserved to the extent possible.
   (d)   When approved by the City, a portion of the planned open space may be
used as detention/retention basins, provided they are designed, arranged and
landscaped in a manner consistent with the requirements for open space areas.
   (e)   The common open space established as part of a Residential Open Space
Planned Development District shall be either:
      (1)   Retained by the owners of the Planned Development area only until
such time as the Covenants and Restrictions specify that the open space becomes

of-way; if it is private the setback is measured from the curb or edge of the
street pavement.
2  Parking shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Chapter
1187 which is two (2) spaces per dwelling unit provided that for each dwelling
unit on a private street additional guest parking shall be provided as
determined by the Planning Commission.
3  The following definitions shall apply to terms used in this Section:
          (a)    Main Wall:  The outside wall(s) of a building that contains

walls.
          (b)  End Wall:  The outside walls of a building, other than a main
wall, which may be blank or contain
                windows not considered to be primary windows.
4  Determined during the review of the development plan.
5  A minimum of 1,000 sq. ft. must be on the ground floor of the dwelling.
 
   (b)   Lot Requirements: Dwelling units are not required to be on lots, and
sublots are not required to have frontage on a public street.  However, all
lots shall be of sufficient size and shape to accommodate dwelling units in
compliance with the spacing requirements of this Section.
   (c)   Required Buffer: The buffer area shall be landscaped with an
acceptably designed wall, fence, planting screen, or mound, or some combination
thereof, as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (d)   Utilities: Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical
systems, are required within the limits of a Residential Open Space Planned
Development District.  Appurtenances to these systems that can be effectively
screened may be exempted from this requirement if the Planning and Zoning
Commission finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character
of the proposed development. 
   (e)   Additional Standards: Additional development requirements, whether
standards or criteria, formulated to achieve the objectives of the District may
be established at the time a Residential Open Space Planned Development
District plan is reviewed.  Any such development requirements adopted with such
plan shall become binding land use requirements for the development.  (Ord. 43-
2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)
1160.08  STREET REQUIREMENTS.
   Each lot and building envelope within a Residential Open Space Planned
Development District shall have sufficient access to ensure safe and efficient
traffic flow and reasonable ingress and egress for emergency vehicles.  To this
end, the street requirements are as follows:
   (a)   Public Streets.  A street shall be required to be publicly dedicated
when such street is a major street that connects two (2) existing public
streets, is intended to provide a future continuing street system beyond the
project boundaries, or is expected to accommodate pass-through traffic going to
and from adjacent developments.
   (b)   Private Streets.  Streets that are not otherwise required to be public
streets pursuant to subsection (a) above may be approved as private streets
when the City determines that:
      (1)   The private street is not planned or expected to be extended to
serve property outside the District.
      (2)   Adequate utility easements are provided to the satisfaction of the
City.
      (3)   The design and layout of the private street provides adequate and
safe access to the intended units.
      (4)   A private street with single access shall provide access to no more
than twenty (20) dwelling units.
      (5)   A construction bond and maintenance bond acceptable to the City
shall be posted for both public and private streets.
   (c)   Pavement Width.  Private streets may be constructed with narrower
pavement widths than required for public streets provided such narrow pavement
is approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission with the recommendation of
the Director of Public Service. 
   (d)   Construction Standards.  All elements of a private street that are to
be provided in an R-6 ROSPDD shall be constructed in accordance with the
construction standards set forth for public streets in the City's Subdivision
Regulations.  However, when the Planning and Zoning Commission, with the
recommendation of the Director of Public Service, determines that certain
elements of a public street do not or should not specifically apply to a
private street due to the circumstances of a particular project or portion of a
project, the Planning and Zoning Commission, may waive or permit a modification
to the installation of any such element(s) to the extent deemed just and proper
provided such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good.  This
provision also applies to waiving the requirements for curbs and storm sewers
when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, with the recommendation of the Director of Public Service, that
based on the topography of the site, open space, density and other
environmental considerations, the proposed open natural drainage system will
equally satisfy the drainage requirements.  (Ord. 43-2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)
1160.09  HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS.
   Homeowners associations, or similar legal entities that, pursuant to Section
1160.06, are responsible for the maintenance and control of common areas
including recreational facilities, common open space, private streets, and
buffer areas, shall be established in such a manner that:
   (a)   Provisions for the establishment of the association or similar entity
is made before any lot in the development is sold or any building occupied;
   (b)   The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to
maintain, exercise control over, and insure such common areas and facilities;
   (c)   The association or similar legal entity has the power to compel
contributions from residents of the development to cover their proportionate
shares of the costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of such common
areas and facilities;
   (d)   Membership in the Association shall be mandatory for all purchasers of
lots or homes in the development.  (Ord. 43-2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)
1160.10  PHASED DEVELOPMENT.
   If the development is to be implemented in phases, each phase shall have
adequate provision for access, parking, storm water management, and other
public improvements to serve the development.  Each phase shall be provided
with temporary or permanent transitional features, buffers, or protective areas
in order to prevent any adverse impact on completed phases, future phases, and
adjoining property.  (Ord. 43-2011.  Passed 4-28-11.)

such amounts as to overload the street network outside the District; and
adequate traffic control measures (i.e. turning lanes and/or signals/signs) are
provided at the intersection of the project's entry roads with the existing
public street.  Traffic control measures may include the reservation of land
for future road widening adjacent to existing public rights-of-way.

when the thirty 30% percent open space requirement is satisfied when
considering all of the land in the application;
   (b)   Has more than two (2) dwelling units per acre based on the gross land

equal to or better than the strict application of the specified standard, the
City may relax such standard to the extent deemed just and proper, provided
that the granting of such relief shall be without detriment to the health and
safety of the community and without detriment to or impairment of the intent of
this Chapter.

1175.01  PURPOSE.
   The unique attributes of Tallmadge, a historically significant City, are
personified by the carefully maintained architecture of our historical past. 
It is intended that Tallmadge's remaining examples of historical architecture
be safeguarded and that new construction be designed as to blend in with the
existing historical integrity of our community.  The purpose of this District
is to:
   (a)   Maintain, safeguard, and enhance the architectural and historical
presence of the Tallmadge Circle, the surrounding development, and the
character along the street frontages radiating from Tallmadge Circle.
   (b)   Review and approve all exterior construction proposed within this
Design Control Overlay District (DCOD).  The Heritage Commission shall
accomplish these purposes by only approving exterior changes according to
accepted and recognized architectural principles (for Recognized Heritage
Structures as set-forth in Chapter
1177) and the compatible design criteria (for all other buildings and
structures) as set forth in this Chapter.
   (c)   Review site development along the frontages of the main streets around
the City's Historic Tallmadge Circle and the frontage of the main roads leading
to and from the Circle to retain the City's traditional, historical and early
characteristics of the center of Tallmadge. 
(Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1175.02  APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   (a)   This Design Control Overlay District (DCOD) is an overlay Zoning
District which is designated on the City of Tallmadge Zoning Map.
   (b)   The principal, conditional, and accessory uses permitted in the
underlying Zoning District, and the development standards not otherwise
modified by this Chapter, shall continue to be applicable.
   (c)   In addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning standards,
not otherwise modified herein, no structure or site within the Design Control
Overlay District, shall be modified, altered, removed, relocated, or otherwise
changed except in compliance with the requirements of this Chapter and other
applicable regulations in this Planning and Zoning Code provided that on any
residentially zoned property that does not have frontage on Tallmadge Circle
the following shall be exempt from the requirements of this Chapter and the
areas of such exemption shall be governed by the underlying Zoning District
regulations:
      (1)   Accessory buildings that are 200 square feet or less, decks,
fencing, and pools, if constructed of pre-approved materials and colors or are
located behind the rear line of the principal building.
      (2)   Re-roofing, re-painting, and re-siding of structures if all
exterior colors and materials used conform to a pre-approved list promulgated
by the Heritage Commission and which are on file in the Zoning Department
provided that the Zoning Administrator determines, based on an application
submitted to the City, that the applicant's intended improvements are exempt
from the provisions of this Chapter. 
   (d)   The Heritage Commission, along with the City Administration, may
promulgate and approve the Design Control Overlay District Review Guidebook,
and other similar material, intended to provide supplemental interpretation of
the provisions of this Chapter and to further guide the evaluation of the
appropriateness of projects coming before the Heritage Commission and the
Planning and Zoning Commission.  If a conflict exists between the Design
Control Overlay District Review Guidebook and the Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning
Ordinance shall govern.
   (e)   If there is a conflict between the provisions of this Chapter and the
provisions of the underlying Zoning District, the provisions of this Chapter
shall govern.  Conversely, if this Chapter is silent with respect to a
regulation, standard, or criteria, such regulation, standard, or criteria found
elsewhere in this Planning and Zoning Code shall govern.
   (f)   For the purposes of this Chapter, a front lot line or the frontage of
the property is the line or portion of the property adjacent to the right-of-
way of Tallmadge Circle and the streets radiating from the Circle which are:
North Ave.; Northeast Ave.; East Ave.; Southeast Ave.; South Ave.; Southwest
Ave.; West Ave. and Northwest Ave.
(Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1175.03  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   The building setback from all street rights-of-way shall be a minimum
of thirty (30) feet and a maximum of fifty (50) feet.  Commercial buildings
shall be encouraged to be set to the minimum front setback line, when possible.
   (b)   The off-street parking shall be setback:
      (1)   From all street rights-of-way a minimum of thirty (30) feet with
the area between the right-of-way line and the parking area landscaped pursuant
to the standards and criteria in Section
1175.06 provided that in areas around Tallmadge Circle where publically owned

1177.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The unique attributes of Tallmadge, a historically significant City,
are personified by the carefully maintained architecture of our historical
past, particularly the two architecturally significant structures that remain
at the center of this unique community.  It is intended that Tallmadge's
remaining examples of historical architecture be safeguarded; that new
construction be designed so as to replicate the existing historical integrity
of the Recognized Heritage Structures.  Therefore, the purposes of this Chapter
are to:
      (1)   Maintain, safeguard, and enhance the architectural and historical
presence of these Recognized Heritage Structures throughout the City.
      (2)   Assure that newer construction or renovation is designed to
complement the historic characteristics within the Design Control Overlay
District.
   (b)   Heritage Commission has been created to review and approve all
exterior construction within the Design Control Overlay District and for all
Recognized Heritage Structures throughout the City.  These purposes shall be
accomplished by reviewing proposals according to accepted and recognized
architectural and design principles, as applicable, to assure all structures
are created, demolished, moved, altered, or remodeled subject to the provisions
of this Chapter and all other applicable ordinances of the City.
(Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1177.02  APPLICATION OF THE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The standards, criteria, and procedures in this Chapter apply to those
buildings designated as Recognized Heritage Structures (RHS) whether they are
within or outside the Design Control Overlay District and all other structures
within DCOD.  The exterior of buildings and structures subject to the
provisions of this Chapter shall only be modified, altered, demolished,
relocated, or otherwise changed when in compliance with the provisions of this
Chapter provided that on any residentially zoned property that does not have
frontage on Tallmadge Circle the following shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Chapter and the areas of such exemption shall be governed
by the underlying Zoning District regulations:
      (1)   Accessory buildings that are 200 square feet or less, decks,
fencing, and pools, if constructed of pre-approved materials and colors or are
located behind the rear line of the principal building.
      (2)   Re-roofing, re-painting, and re-siding of structures in the Overlay
District, if all exterior colors and materials used conform to a pre-approved
list by the Heritage Commission and on file in the Zoning Department provided
that the Zoning Administrator determines, based on an application submitted to
the City, that the applicant's intended improvements are exempt from the
provisions of this Chapter.
   (b)   The list of properties designated as Recognized Heritage Structures
shall be maintained by the Clerk of Council and shall be made available for
public review during normal business hours.
   (c)   The Heritage Commission along with the City Administration may
promulgate and approve the Design Control Overlay District Review Guidebook,
and other similar material, which is intended to provide supplemental
interpretation of the provisions of this Chapter and Chapter
1175 and to further guide the evaluation of the appropriateness of those
projects before the Heritage Commission.  If a conflict exists between the
Design Control Overlay District Review Guidebook and the Zoning Ordinance, the
Zoning Ordinance shall govern.
(Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1177.03  CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING RECOGNIZED HERITAGE STRUCTURES (RHS).
   (a)   The Heritage Commission shall consider any century old structure for
inclusion as a Recognized Heritage Structures (RHS).
   (b)   The Heritage Commission shall make a determination based on the
percentage of the total structure that is 100 years old or older: whether the
original structure has substantially the same exterior architectural appearance
as when it was constructed: and how well later additions complement the
original structure.  The architecture of these buildings shall either adhere to
Greek Revival or Federalist style architecture, commonly referred to locally as
Western Reserve style architecture, which is the predominant historical
architecture in the City, or reflect any other prevailing architectural style
of the building.
   The architecture shall complement the architectural styling of the historic
church constructed in 1825, and/or the historic town hall constructed in 1857
in order for these proposed Recognized Heritage Structures to complement the
City's unique history as an early community on the Connecticut Western
Reserve.  The structures must also meet one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   That it has character, interest, or value as part of the
development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the community, county,
state, or country;
      (2)   That its location was a site of a significant local, county, state,
or national event;
      (3)   That it is identified with a person who significantly contributed
to the development of the community, county, state, or country;
      (4)   That it embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural
style valuable for the study of a period, type, method of construction, or use
of materials;
      (5)   That it is identified as the work of a master builder, designer,
architect, or landscape architect whose individual work has influenced the
development of the community, county, state, or country;
      (6)   That it embodies elements of design, detailing, materials, or
craftsmanship that render it architecturally significant;
      (7)   That it embodies design elements that make it structurally or
architecturally innovative;
      (8)   That it has a unique location or singular physical characteristics
that make it an established or familiar visual feature;
      (9)   That it is a particularly fine or unique example of a utilitarian
structure; or
      (10)   That it is suitable and economically feasible for preservation or
restoration.
         (Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1177.04  PROCEDURES FOR DESIGNATING A RECOGNIZED HERITAGE STRUCTURE.
   (a)   The Heritage Commission may submit an application for a structure to
be included as a Recognized Heritage Structure at any time.  After such
designation, if a structure is awarded any funding from an economic development
grant program, the structure may not be removed within five (5) years from
receipt of grant funds unless the total amount of the grant has been refunded.
   (b)   The Heritage Commission shall hold a public meeting for the purpose of
considering structures for inclusion. The Heritage Commission shall notify by
U.S. Postal Services each property owner whose structure is being considered
for inclusion at least twenty (20) days prior to the public meeting.
   (c)   If more than one building or structure is on a property, the Heritage
Commission shall determine the number of these structures that are included in
the designation.  Once the structure is recommended for inclusion as a RHS,
there is a presumption of having historic, architectural, or cultural value to
the citizens of Tallmadge.
   (d)   Not longer than 120 days after the conclusion of the public meeting,
the Heritage Commission shall recommend a structure(s) for inclusion as
Recognized Heritage Structures (RHS) to the City Council.  Upon the receipt of
such recommendation, the City Council shall hold a public hearing within 60
days for the purpose of consideration of the application.  The City Council may
approve, modify, or deny the application(s).  In the case of modification or
denial, the City Council shall state in the record of its meetings the reason
(s) for such modification or denial. 
   (e)   The owner(s) of any structure recommended for inclusion, or currently
designated as a RHS may apply to be removed from the RHS designation by
following these procedures:
      (1)   Complete and submit a form for exclusion, available from the office
of the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Provide such items as a copy of the owner's title evidence;
information about the structure; historical records or relevant statements of
previous owners; written statements from qualified experts on the condition of
the structure; color photographs of each elevation; and any other information
to assist the Heritage Commission in their review of the exclusion request.

structure must include the following information:
      (1)   A written statement from the owner(s) indicating reasons for the
demolition or moving;
      (2)   An analysis of feasibility of rehabilitation, including the costs
of rehabilitation, the market value of the property after rehabilitation, and,
in case of income-producing properties, the income and expense likely to be
produced by the property after rehabilitation.
   (b)   The Heritage Commission shall consider the exclusion and grant the
request if it finds one or more of the following:
      (1)   Within the Design Control Overlay District, the exclusion of the
structure would not detract from the district based on the criteria set forth
in this Chapter and Chapter
1175;
      (2)   For stand-alone structures, with new information to be provided, it
is determined that the structure does not comply with Section
1177.04;
      (3)   It is determined by an independent architect who specializes in
historic preservation that it is not feasible to preserve or restore the
structure due to its deteriorated condition; or
      (4)   In cases where an applicant applies to demolish a Recognized
Heritage Structures (RHS), the Heritage Commission shall only grant the
demolition when sufficient documentation has been submitted to the Heritage
Commission by an independent architect specializing in historic preservation
that deterioration has progressed to the point where it is not economically or
structurally feasible to restore the structure. The cost of such documentation
shall be borne by the applicant.
   (c)   Not longer than 120 days after the conclusion of the public meeting,
the Heritage Commission shall recommend a structure(s) for inclusion as
Recognized Heritage Structures (RHS) to the City Council.  Upon the receipt of
such recommendation, the City Council shall hold a public hearing within 60
days for the purpose of consideration of the application.  The City Council may

(Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1177.08  MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any RHS or property provided such work involves no
change in material, design, texture, color or exterior appearance; nor shall
anything in this Chapter be construed to prevent any repair of structural
deficiency, which in the view of the Zoning Administrator is required for the
public safety because of an unsafe, insecure or dangerous condition.
(Ord.  70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1177.09  APPEALS.

in this Code.  Such appeal shall be taken in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Chapter
1137.  A three-fourths (3/4) vote of the members of the Board of Zoning Appeals
is required to overrule a decision of the Heritage Commission.  In the event
that the Board of Zoning Appeals does not affirm the decision of the Heritage
Commission, the Board shall state its findings of fact and reasons in the
minutes of its meeting and shall forward a copy of such minutes to the Heritage
Commission. 
(Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1177.10  EMERGENCY ORDERS.
   Notwithstanding other provisions of this Chapter, whenever the Zoning
Administrator finds that an emergency exists in any structure subject to the
regulations herein, which requires immediate action to protect the public's
health and safety or that of the occupants thereof, the Zoning Administrator
may issue an order certifying that such conditions exist and requiring actions
as are necessary to meet such emergency.  Subsequent to the correction of an
emergency, the owner(s) of an affected property shall apply for and obtain, as
applicable, a Certificate of Appropriateness or a Certificate of Design
Compliance and shall restore such property in conformance with the applicable
requirements and procedures.
(Ord. 70-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)

   “Fence” or “Wall” means any structure composed of wood, steel, iron,
masonry, stone, plastic, vinyl, or other material erected in such a manner and
positioned as to enclose or partially enclose any property or any part of any
property.  Structures erected other than on lot lines or in close proximity to
lot lines, which have solely an ornamental purpose and which do not in fact
serve the purpose of enclosing or partially enclosing property or of separating
property from adjoining property, shall not be included within the definition
of the word “fences” or “walls”.
(Ord. 61-2003.  Passed 7-10-03.)
1181.04  PERMITTED FENCES AND WALLS.
   (a)   Fences or walls erected within the minimum front yard setback shall

the ground or supporting area and shall not project over adjoining properties
or right-of-way lines.
   (g)   Snow fences may be erected between November 1 and March 31.  All snow

or other apparatus that may be used from time to time for maintenance of the
utility.  Fences or walls in drainage easements shall require prior approval of
the City Engineer to allow for proper flow of water.
   (c)   When a fence or wall obstructs access to a utility box, manhole, or
other public apparatus for maintaining utilities, the owner shall be required
to remove such fence or wall at his expense without remuneration from the City.

Department shall furnish such inspection as is deemed necessary to determine
that the fence or wall is constructed in accordance with plans submitted for
the certificate, provided, however, that the issuance of such certificate by
the Building and Zoning Department shall not be construed to mean the Building
and Zoning Department has determined the fence or wall is not encroaching upon
another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duties imposed
herein.  (Ord. 61-2003.  Passed 7-10-03.)
1181.09  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.

1183.01  PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of this Zoning Code to establish reasonable regulations
governing the size, character, and location of signs within the City of
Tallmadge, in a manner that contributes to the safety and general welfare of
its citizens and the needs of businesses and other affected sectors of the
community.  Within this framework this Chapter is adopted to achieve the
following objectives:
   (a)   To minimize the possibility that sign size, location, or character
will create hazards adversely affecting the public safety.
   (b)   To establish sign limitations which allow reasonable capability for
advertisement, but which prevent the escalation of sign competition to levels
which are non- productive and create unnecessarily high entrepreneurial costs.
   (c)   To provide sign regulations which are directly related to land use and
therefore to the functional and economic need for signs of varying sizes, types
and locations.
   (d)   To create a more aesthetically pleasing urban environment, without
unreasonably limiting the right of individuals to employ signs in the
legitimate use of their property.
   (e)   To eliminate abandoned, obsolete and deteriorated signs that impart a
blighting influence on surrounding properties.
      (Ord. 67-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1183.02  APPLICATION OF SIGN REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The regulations contained in this Chapter shall apply to signs outside
of the public right-of-way, except when specifically stated otherwise.
   (b)   A sign may only be erected, established, painted, created, or
maintained in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions of this
Chapter and other applicable City regulations.
   (c)   The following signs and displays are exempt from the regulations of
this Chapter:
      (1)   Any sign displaying a public notice or warning required by a valid
and applicable federal, state, or local law, ordinance, or regulation.
      (2)   An historic Building Marker not exceeding four (4) square feet in
area.
      (3)   Flags of the United States, the state, foreign nations having
diplomatic relations with the United States, and any other flag adopted or
sanctioned by an elected legislative body of competent jurisdiction.  These
flags must be flown in accordance with protocol established by the Congress of
the United States for the Stars and Stripes.  Any flag not meeting these
conditions shall be considered a sign and shall be subject to regulations as
such.
      (4)   Works of art that do not include a commercial message.
      (5)   A decorative display of religious and/or other holiday lights and
decorations containing no commercial message when displayed during the
appropriate time of the year.
      (6)   Any traffic control sign, such as "STOP" or "YIELD," located on
private property that meets applicable governmental standards pertaining to
such signs and does not display a commercial message.
         (Ord. 67-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1183.03  COMPUTATIONS.
   The following are the basic measurement standards to determine sign area,
sign height, window area, and building frontages:
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.  Sign area shall include the face
of all the display areas of the sign, excluding the frame and structural
support.  Architectural features are not considered signs and are exempt from
these regulations.
      (1)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area or dimensions
shall include the display portion of the sign and shall not include the area of
any structural frames or structural supports.
      (2)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, emblems, logos
or elements on a wall, or an irregularly shaped freestanding sign, the area of
the sign shall encompass a regular, or a combination of not more than three (3)
regular, geometric shape(s) which form or approximate the perimeter of all the
elements in the display. When separate elements are organized to form a single
sign, but the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be
calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which
comprise the entire display area, including the space between the elements.  Up
to five (5) percent of the permitted sign area may be considered minor
protrusions and extend outside the maximum limitation of three (3) regular
geometric shapes, and are, therefore, exempted from being included as part of
the sign area.
      (3)   For freestanding signs, the area for a sign with more than one face
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that
both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign
faces are part of the same sign structure, are joined, are parallel or are
within thirty (30) degrees of being parallel to each other and are at no point
separated by a distance that exceeds three (3) feet, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
         B.   For any sign that has two (2) display faces that do not comply
with the provision in above subsection A., or has more than two (2) display
surfaces, then each surface shall be included when determining the area of the
sign.
      (4)   In determining the area of freestanding signs, the structural
frames and supports shall be exempted from being considered as part of the
maximum permitted sign area and such exemptions shall also include:
         A.   The portion of a solid sign base, up to a maximum height of two
(2) feet that is anticipated to be substantially screened by landscaping at the
time of installation;
         B.   Additional base area, when such areas are determined to be:
            1.   Constructed and designed with materials which are similar to,
or compatible with, the architecture of the building or other site features;
and,
            2.   Not intended or designed to include messages and excludes
colors, trademarks, or any other decorative design features that are primarily
intended to attract attention, but rather are unobtrusive and compatible with
the architecture of the building or other site features.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height.  The height of a sign shall be measured from
the base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of attachment to the
ground to the top most elements of the sign.  A freestanding sign on a man-made
base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the grade of the
nearest street, drive or parking area, whichever is the highest grade
reference.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontages and the Building Unit.
      (1)   The length of the building wall that faces the principal street or
the length of the wall that contains the main entrance to the uses therein
shall be considered the primary building frontage.  The building frontage shall
be measured along the length of the front wall between the exterior faces of
the exterior side walls.
      (2)   A site/building will be considered to have secondary frontage when
any of the following site/building characteristics are present:
         A.   The subject site is a corner lot;
         B.   The primary parking area is not located adjacent to a public
street; and,
         C.   The building or unit has walls with ingress and egress that do
not face the public street.
      (3)   When a site has both primary and secondary frontages, the property
owner shall determine which wall shall be the primary building frontage and
which wall(s) shall be the secondary building frontage.  Only one outside wall
of any business shall be considered its primary frontage.
      (4)   For signs in commercial and industrial districts, in no case shall
a building elevation abutting and facing a residential district be considered a
secondary frontage and signs shall not be permitted on any such secondary
building frontage.
      (5)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased by a single tenant shall be considered a building unit. The building
frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party
walls defining the building unit.
      (6)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a straight line extended
along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
   (d)   Determining Window Area.  The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the ground floor of the building frontage,
provided that for the purpose of these regulations, the height of windows on
the ground floor shall be that portion of window(s) within fifteen (15) feet of
grade.
   (e)   Determining Sign Setbacks.  The required setbacks for any freestanding
sign shall apply to all elements of the sign, including its frame and base.
      (Ord. 67-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1183.04  PERMANENT SIGNS IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Sign Standards.  Permanent signs for all residential uses and for
nonresidential uses in residential districts shall be limited in number, area,
height and setback based on the type of use, as set forth in Schedule
1183.04(a).

following:
         A.   One (1) additional sign for each one-hundred fifty (150) ft. of
frontage greater than one-hundred fifty (150) lineal feet of frontage shall be
permitted provided that the area of each additional freestanding sign shall
comply with Schedule
1183.05 (c); and
         B.   On a corner lot two (2) permitted freestanding signs may be
aggregated into a single sign at the intersection of two streets.  On a lot
greater than 150 feet of frontage, the permissible sign area may be aggregated
into fewer signs.  However, the maximum area of any freestanding sign face
shall not exceed 150 percent of the maximum area permitted for a single sign.
      (2)   Minimum Separation of Freestanding Sign.  Freestanding signs on the
same lot shall be separated by a minimum of 150 feet, as measured along the
street right-of-way line.  For corner lots, both sides of the intersection
shall be used in measuring spacing.
      (3)   Multi-Occupant Facilities.  When a freestanding sign (or signs) is
permitted on a site that has more than one occupant, it is the property owner's
responsibility to determine if the permitted sign area shall be devoted to
identification of the building(s), the anchor occupant, all occupants, or some
combination thereof.
      (4)   Changeable Copy.  Changeable copy shall be limited to a maximum of
fifty (50) percent of the permitted freestanding sign area or eighteen (18)
square feet, whichever is less.  Changeable copy may be either computer driven
or manually changed.
   (e)   Additional Signs for Commercial Properties with Frontage Abutting I-
76.  In addition to the signs otherwise permitted in this Chapter, one (1)
additional wall sign and one (1) additional freestanding sign shall be

The additional signs shall comply with the area requirements for a primary
frontage as set forth in Schedule
1183.05(a) and the area and height requirements for a free standing sign in
Schedule
1183.05(c).
   (f)   Instructional Signs.
      (1)   An instructional sign is a sign clearly incidental to the use of
the property and intended to instruct employees, customers, or users, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, in matters of public safety, interest,
and welfare and such signs shall not be included in the permitted sum of the
sign areas regulated by this Chapter, provided such sign is not larger than
necessary to serve the intended instructional purpose, and such sign is not in
a location, nor includes design characteristics, that constitute or serve the
purposes of publically advertising the use(s) on the property. Instructional
signs may include, but are not limited to: ATM's, drive-thru's, parking and
circulation instructions, hours of operation, credit card or other payment
offerings or requirements, safety instructions, etc.
      (2)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed sign(s)
does not serve instructional purposes, it shall be considered a freestanding or
wall sign, as applicable, and subject to the pertinent regulations in this
Chapter.
         (Ord. 67-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)
1183.06  TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   (a)   Temporary Signs in Residential Districts. Temporary signs are
permitted in Residential Districts subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Each residential unit and each non-residential use shall be
permitted to erect two (2) temporary signs either in a window or as a
freestanding sign in the front yard. The sign face area of such temporary signs
shall not exceed six (6) square feet and the maximum height shall not be
greater than five (5) ft.  Such signs shall not advertise a home occupation and
shall not include any commercial messages for products, services, or activities
that are not taking place on the property.  Temporary freestanding signs shall
not be located in the public right of way and shall be at least fifteen (15)
feet from a side lot line.
      (2)   Temporary Signs for Non-residential Uses.  In addition to the above
temporary signs:
         A.   Special Event Signs.  One temporary freestanding sign or one
banner not exceeding thirty-two (32) sq. ft., either attached to the front of
the building or in the front yard, shall be permitted for a period not to
exceed seven (7) days, four times per calendar year.  Such temporary
freestanding sign shall be located no closer than 15 feet from the street
right-of-way line or a side lot line.
         B.   Project Real Estate/Construction Signs.  One (1) project real
estate/ construction sign shall be permitted for each street frontage for the
duration of construction or only during the time needed. Such signs shall be a
maximum of thirty-two (32) sq. ft. and have a maximum height of eight (8) feet
and be located a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from any street right-of-way.  A
real estate or construction sign shall be erected and maintained on a lot only
during the period of time that the parcel, or development, is up for sale,
rent, or lease or the building project is under construction.  When seventy-
five percent (75%) of all lots/dwelling units in the development have been
sold, the project real estate or construction sign shall be removed.  After
such removal, individual signs may be erected on the remaining lots/units in
conformance with Section
1183.06 (a)(1).
      (3)   Official public interest sign or directional signs as authorized by
the Mayor.  When authorizing such sign(s) the Mayor shall also determine the

for temporary signs in non-residential districts are in addition to the maximum
sign area and height regulations set forth in Section
1183.05.
      (1)   Window Signs.  The area of temporary window signs, either affixed
thereto, or within two (2) feet of the window and visible from the outside the
building, shall not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the window area. 
However, since the maximum coverage area in Schedule
1183.05(a) applies to all window signs - both permanent and temporary - the
allowance for temporary window signs is reduced to the extent that permanent
window signs are utilizing a portion of the thirty-five (35%) percent coverage
allowance.
      (2)   Project Real Estate/Construction Signs.  One (1) project real
estate or construction sign for a development project shall be permitted for
each street frontage, shall be a maximum of thirty two (32) square ft., be a
maximum height of eight (8) ft. and located a minimum of ten (10) feet from any
street right-of-way.  Such a project real estate or construction sign shall be
erected and maintained only during the period of time that the parcel is up for
sale, rent, or lease or the building project is under construction.  When any
permanent sign has been installed on the property prior to the completion of
construction, such temporary construction sign shall be removed within two (2)
business days of installation of the permanent identification sign.
      (3)   Other Temporary Signs.
         A.   Temporary signs, whether freestanding signs or banners attached
to the front of the building or on the roof, shall be permitted for a period
not to exceed fourteen (14) days and not more than four (4) times per calendar
year.  In a multiple tenant building on site, each tenant must confine these
signs to a location on the wall of the business or within twenty (20) ft. of
the business.  A roof sign permitted pursuant to this Section may not extend
above the surface of the roof more than eight (8) feet.
         B.   Sandwich board signs and similar types of temporary signs, for
the purpose of promoting the business during normal business hours, shall be
permitted in the C-3, C-4, and C-5 Districts.  Such signs shall be placed no
more than five (5) feet from the front of the building, shall not be placed in
the public right-of-way, and shall not obstruct a walkway reserved for public
passage.  Such signs shall not exceed three (3) feet in height or two (2) feet
in width.  Sandwich board signs must be placed indoors at the close of each
business day.
         C.   Within sixty (60) days of and not more than five (5) days after a
general, special, or primary election additional non-commercial temporary signs
are permitted on property provided that no sign shall be greater than sixteen
(16) square feet in area.
         D.   Official public interest sign or directional signs as authorized
by the Mayor.  When authorizing such sign(s) the Mayor shall also determine the
entity responsible for erecting and removing the sign and the length of time
the sign(s) may be in place.
            (Ord. 67-2012.  Passed 9-13-12.)

which best illustrates how the sign shall be experienced by the public after it
is erected on the site.  Specifically, the application shall include:
      (1)   A photograph, or drawings, and site plan showing the location of
the sign and its relationship to the building, the building setbacks and lot
width, the locations and square footage areas of all existing signs on site,
the adjacent parcels and parking lots, drives and sidewalks;
      (2)   Detailed drawings showing the design of the sign, including size,
style of lettering, logo and other graphic features, colors of the applied
lettering and background, materials of the sign and the frame or structure;
      (3)   Construction, erection or fastening details, including wattage of
electric lamps or illuminating tubes, if applicable; and
      (4)   A permit fee for each sign application, pursuant to a fee schedule

maintained in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (f)   Modifications.  Any proposed sign that is not in compliance with the
objective standards in this Chapter may be reviewed by the Planning
Commission.  When reviewing the appropriateness of such modification from the
regulations herein, the Planning Commission shall approve such sign only when
it determines that:
      (1)   Visibility of the sign in compliance with this Chapter will be
impeded because of such factors as: topographic conditions on and around the
property; the location of buildings and structures on the site and/or
surrounding properties; speed of traffic and the number of travel lanes on the
adjacent roadway.
      (2)   The modified sign is of such size and scale to be appropriate for
the size of the building and the portion of the building (panel, fascia, wall,
etc.) on which the sign will be placed.
      (3)   The proposed sign is the minimum of relief necessary to assure it
is legible to the intended viewers which are typically the passing motorists.
      (4)   The additional sign, the additional sign area, the alternative
location that is proposed, and/or the design of the proposed sign will not
adversely impact the adjacent residential areas or, otherwise, compromise any
other public interests.

no fee shall be charged.
      (1)   In accordance with the provision of this section, no use of land,
buildings or structures shall be made other than that specified on the 
"Certificate of Non-conforming Use" unless such use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of the use zone in which the property is located.

period not to exceed fifteen days, but not more than two time periods during a
calendar year.  Such promotions or sales shall be held only upon receipt of a
permit issued by the City Building Department.  A fee as established by Council

1189.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   Until recent years, the regulation of all uses of land and structures
through zoning has been accomplished by assigning each use to one or more use
districts.  However, the functions and characteristics of an increasing number
of new kinds of land uses combined with conclusive experience regarding some of
the older, familiar kinds of uses call for a more flexible and equitable
procedure for properly accommodating these activities in the community.  It
should be recognized that the forces that influence decisions regarding the
nature, magnitude, and location of such types of land use activities are many
and varied, depending upon functional characteristics, competitive situations,
and the availability of land.  Rather than assign all uses to special,
individual and limited zoning districts, it is important to provide
controllable and reasonable flexibility in requirements for certain kinds of
uses that will allow practicable latitude for the investor, but that will, at
the same time, maintain adequate provision for the security of the health,
safety, convenience, and general welfare of the community's inhabitants.
   (b)   In order to accomplish such a dual objective, provision is made in
this Chapter for a more detailed consideration of each of certain specified
activities as it may relate to proposed conditions of location, design, size,
operation, intensity of use, generation of traffic and traffic movements,
concentration of population, processes and equipment employed, amount and kind
of public facilities and services required, together with many other possible
factors.  Land and structure uses possessing these particularly unique
characteristics are designated as Conditionally Permissible Uses and are
permitted through the issuance of a Conditional Zoning Certificate with such
conditions and safeguards attached as may be deemed necessary for the
protection of the public welfare.

      118   Planned Residential Developments.
         A.   Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to enable the
development and/or redevelopment of properties within the largely built-up
areas of the City of Tallmadge in a manner that preserves neighborhood
character, allows housing opportunities, enhances property values, and serves
the health, safety and welfare interests of the residents of the City of
Tallmadge.  These purposes may be served by encouraging ingenuity, imagination,
and heightened design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site
planners, and developers to produce residential developments which are in
keeping with the over-all land use and open space objectives of this Zoning
Code and the Comprehensive Plan of the City of Tallmadge.
      Further, the intent of this subsection is to permit departure from the
strict application of use, setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements
of existing residential use districts to enable design flexibility for planned
developments which:
            1.   Meet or exceed basic design criteria.
            2.   Permit a creative approach to the development of residential
land.
            3.   Provide development densities allowing a gradual transition
from more intense uses such as higher density residential, commercial, or
industrial zoning to less intense zoning.  Existing conditional uses shall not
be considered in determining transitional areas.
            4.   Accomplish a more desirable environment than would be possible
through the strict application of minimum requirements of this Zoning Code.
            5.   Provide for an efficient use of land, resulting in smaller
networks of utilities and streets and thereby lower housing costs.
            6.   Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation
of natural features, the provision of underground utilities, and the provision
of recreation areas and open space in excess of existing zoning, and
subdivision requirements.
            7.   Provide an opportunity for new approaches to home ownership.
            8.   Provide an environment of stable character compatible with
surrounding residential areas.
            9.   Provide a pattern of development which preserves trees, open
space, outstanding natural topography and geologic features and prevents soil
erosion.
         B.   Minimum Standards for Eligibility.  To be eligible for Planned
Residential Development status, a project must involve at least 5 acres of
contiguous, appropriately zoned residential property.  Such property must not
be interrupted by any State or Federal highway, arterial roadway, railroad
right-of-way, or land not a part of the proposed development.  Public and
private collector and local streets and utility easements shall not be
considered to interrupt a Planned Residential Development.
         C.   Voluntary Development Procedure.  Use of Planned Residential
Development is not mandatory for any parcel of ground.  The intent and purpose
of this process is to provide a voluntary alternate procedure which maximizes
the utilization of land primarily for the benefit, use, ownership and enjoyment
of the future residents of the area and the existing residents of the City. 
Open space and common recreation areas and facilities are the environmental and
livability benefits furnished to the homeowner and community in lieu of large
individual lots.
         D.   Nature of Special Exception.  Development plans approved under
the provisions of the process contained herein are declared to be in the nature
of a special exception.
         E.   Location.  A Planned Residential Development may be established
in a R-3, R-4 or R-5 zoning district in accordance with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.  A zoning certificate and/or building
permit for any structure shall be issued only after plans for such development
have been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council.  The
location of all structures in a Planned Residential Development shall be
located as shown on the approved plans.
         F.   Submission of Plans.  The developer shall present plans, reports,
and related information in sufficient detail to enable the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Council to evaluate the proposed development in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
         G.   Design of a Planned Residential Development.
            1.   Design Standards.  Except as indicated in this Chapter,
standards of design and construction for improvements located within a Planned
Residential Development shall conform to those standards specified in Chapter
1113 - Design Standards and Chapter
1117 - Uniform Improvement Requirements of the Codified Ordinances of the City
of Tallmadge.  Where exceptional design or unique site conditions warrant,
departure from the City of Tallmadge design standards may be permitted in the
following limited areas:
Sidewalks one side of street only or none if alternate pedestrian
accommodations are provided.
                  Front yard setback.
                  Minimum street right-of-way width.
   Such departures must be justified by the applicant’s narrative explanation
and be recommended by the City Engineer.
            2.   Open Space.
               a.   No less than thirty percent (30%) of the gross area of the
project shall be devoted to open space.  With the exception of 25 feet of the
minimum setback requirement from existing single-family residential property,
and twenty-five feet of the required eighty foot rear yard setback between
building walls, the open space area shall not include minimum setbacks as
described elsewhere in this section, buildings, parking areas, driveways,
public or private roadways or any other impervious surfaces.
               b.   Ownership of an open space shall either be by:
                  i.   Dedication to the City of Tallmadge for public purposes
of any open space subject to its acceptance by Council.
                  ii.   Homeowners or Condominium Association.  An
incorporated, non-profit organization operating under recorded land agreements
through which each lot and/or home owner in a planned residential or other
described land area is automatically a member and each lot is automatically
subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for the
organization’s activities, such as maintaining a common property, and the
charge if unpaid, becomes a lien against the property.  If the open space is
privately held the City may either require a development easement over the land
or a deed restriction so as to insure it from being built upon.  Covenants and
deed restrictions shall be in a form and with content satisfactory to the City
Zoning Official and Director of Law.
                  iii.   A combination of 1 and 2 above.
               c.   Areas designated for required open space may be used in the
following manner:
                  i.   Preserved in its natural state.
                  ii.   Designated and used for the passive enjoyment of
residents of the proposed development (or general public).
                  iii.   No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of a dry
retention basin shall be included as open space.  Wet retention ponds may be
included as open space if they are developed as open space amenities
supplemented with walkways, wildlife habitat features or other passive
recreation amenities such as wildlife viewing areas, benches, etc.
                  iv.   Used for active recreation where such uses have been
located where they have the least impact on natural amenities and wildlife
habitat and where these active recreation uses occupy no more than fifty
percent of the total required open space area.
               d.   Maintenance of open space areas.
                  i.   Where a Homeowners or Condominium Association has failed
to provide adequate maintenance of common open space, the City of Tallmadge in
its sole discretion may perform such maintenance and may charge to the
Association actual, administrative and legal costs incurred.  Unpaid charges
shall become a lien against the property.  In the interests of preservation of
health, safety, and general welfare, failure of the Association to remedy
maintenance problems and discharge any liens against it may result in cessation
of the issuance of occupancy permits for any property party to the Association
until such time as an adequate remedy is provided.
                  ii.   Where storm-water detention facilities are provided, a
maintenance easement satisfactory to the City Engineer shall be provided to
permit equipment access to such facilities for emergency maintenance service.
            3.   Permitted Uses.  A Planned Residential Development may be
composed entirely of single-family detached units, or a mix of single-family
detached units and single-family attached units.
            4.   Density.  Density shall be calculated based on the gross area
of property in each eligible zoning district, minus developable land area. 
Undevelopable land area includes sloping sites with grades in excess of 25
percent, water bodies and wetlands larger than one- quarter acre area, land
located within the 100-year flood plain, easement areas where land use is
already restricted, existing and proposed street right-of-ways.  Where streets
are private, a fifty- foot right-of-way shall be assumed for purposes of
calculating densities.  Planned Residential Development density shall not
exceed one (1) times the number of units per developable acre permitted by the
zoning districts of land included in the project area. 
            5.   Height.  No building shall exceed a building height of thirty-
five (35) feet.
            6.   All units shall be harmonious in design and character with the
existing neighborhood.
            7.   Developers will attempt to incrementally tier density within
the Planned Residential Development so as to provide for gradual density
change.
            8.   No more than four (4) dwelling units may be attached by common
or adjoining walls in single-family attached dwelling portions of a Planned
Residential Development.  Where more than three units have common or adjoining
walls, no more than three (3) units shall front on the same facade.

groundcovers, ornamental plants and flowers, deciduous and evergreen shrubs, as
well as deciduous and evergreen trees necessary to provide screening of
undesirable views, to buffer adjacent uses, to provide individual unit privacy,

aesthetics.
      119   Such use shall also be used for family dwelling purposes.
      121   Such uses shall be conducted not closer than fifty (50) feet from
any R- District.  Where the use abuts upon but is separated from an R-District
by a street, the width of the street may be considered as a part of the
required setback.  The construction, operation, and maintenance of such uses
shall be such that they will not be hazardous, noxious or offensive due to the
emission of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, fumes, noise, vibration, refuse
matters or water carried wastes.

(Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)
1189.07  CONDITIONAL ZONING CERTIFICATES FOR SPECIAL NONRESIDENTIAL
DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Purpose. It is recognized that in a rapidly changing and developing
community that it will from time to time become necessary to give consideration
to the use of land in certain areas for less or more restrictive purposes than
are presently delineated and to preserve insofar as possible, property values
and uses and maintain adequate provision for the security of the health,
safety, convenience and general welfare of the City as a whole.
   (b)   Special Nonresidential Development and Use. In order to implement the
purpose set forth in subsection (a) hereof, there is hereby established a
special non-residential development and use which may be permitted in any use
district.
   (c)   Petition: Permissive Use. The owner or owners of any tract of land in
any use district or districts may petition Council for permission to use such
land for less or more restrictive uses than are permitted under the existing
zoning or conditionally permitted zoning on such land. Such permissive use
shall, if granted, be subject to conditions, limitations and stipulations as
are established by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council. Such uses,
if granted, shall be specifically limited to those specified in such permissive
use.
      (1)   Criteria to be used. Such less or more restrictive uses shall be
determined to be those based upon criteria used in determination of Zoning
Districts and permitted uses hereunder of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Restrictions. The uses permitted hereunder shall not be changed,
modified, extended, or restricted after the granting thereof.
   (d)   Application. The procedures for making application and the criteria by
which an application is evaluated are the same as those used for conditional
uses under Sections
1189.02 and
1189.04 of this Zoning Code plus the following considerations:
   The Planning and Zoning Commission and Council, in judging and weighing the
merit of the proposal, shall consider and impose requirements for such
development such as, but not limited to, those delineated herein:
      (1)   Off-street parking needs, its location and arrangement, paving,
exits, entrances, size and arrangement of individual parking spaces, aisles,
car stops, bumpers.
      (2)   Lighting of the area under consideration.
      (3)   Signs as to their location, illumination, size, design, types.
      (4)   The alleviation of problems which may adversely affect neighboring
property by requiring fences, walls, gates, landscaping and other plantings.
      (5)   Minor variation of building lines to accommodate the most effective
use of the land for the requirement of surrounding open space as will
effectively retain the character of the entire area.
      (6)   Require adequate provision for drainage.
      (7)   Approved building plans and designs as presented or alternates in
keeping with the character of the neighborhood.
      (8)   Such other considerations and improvements as the Planning and
Zoning Commission and Council may deem desirable, necessary and reasonable to
properly protect the interests of adjacent property owners and the public
health, welfare and safety.  By the mention of lighting, signs or other items,
it is not intended that the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council are
required to permit, consider, or approve such items if in their opinion such
items as signs, lighting or other listed items are best omitted in the interest
and for the protection of the neighborhood or general public.
      (9)   Establish time limits for the performance of the requirements,
improvements, and establish bond requirements to assure proper and timely
development and fulfillment of imposed requirements.
         (Ord. 89-1997. Passed 12-11-97.)
1189.08  SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   When considering any conditional use, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Code. 
Violations of such conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms
under which the conditional use is granted shall be deemed a violation of this
Code.

Riparian Setbacks
1190.01   Purpose.
1190.02   Compliance and violations.
1190.03   Conflicts with other regulations and severability.
1190.04   Definitions.
1190.05   Establishment of a riparian setback.
1190.06   Uses permitted.
1190.07   Uses prohibited.
1190.08   Nonconforming structures or uses.
1190.09   Boundary interpretation and appeals procedure.
1190.10   Variances within riparian setback.
1190.11   Inspection.
1190.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City of Tallmadge has determined that the system of streams within
the City contributes to the health, safety, and general welfare of the
residents of the City. The purpose of this chapter is to protect and preserve
the water quality within streams of the City and to protect residents of the
City from property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the
stream. The City will implement this chapter by controlling uses and
developments within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the
riparian area to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in streams or
in runoff before they enter streams.
      (4)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream
channels.
      (5)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (6)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide
array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
      (7)   Benefit the City economically by minimizing encroachment on stream
channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams
and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the
safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to the scenic beauty and to
the environment of the City, the quality of life of the residents of the City,
and corresponding property values.
   (b)   This chapter has been enacted to protect these services of riparian
areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses in
riparian setbacks.
(Ord.  25-2006.  Passed 8-10-06.)
1190.02  COMPLIANCE AND VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   No preliminary plan or zoning approvals shall be issued by the City
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations where applicable.
   (b)   Any person or organization who violates this Chapter shall be guilty
of a minor misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to punishment as
provided in Chapter
1199 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, and shall be required to restore
the riparian setback through a plan approved by the appropriate Soil and Water
Conservation District (SWCD).
   (c)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a
Court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development, or to
restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the
provisions of this Chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, or
regulations, or the orders of the City. 
(Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 8-10-06.)
1190.03  CONFLICTS WITH OTHER REGULATIONS AND SEVERABILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by any other provision of law, regulation, contract, or
deed, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
   (b)   These regulations shall not limit or restrict the application of other
provisions of law, regulation, contract, or deed, or the legal remedies
available thereunder, except as provided in division (a) of this section.
   (c)   If any clause, section, or provision of these regulations is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected.  (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 8-10-06.)
1190.04  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this, the following definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   (a)   “Best management practices (BMPs).” Conservation practices or
protection measures which reduce impacts from a particular land use. Best
Management Practices for construction are outlined in “Rainwater and Land
Development, Ohio’s Standard for Storm Water Management, Land Development, and
Urban Stream Protection” prepared by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.
   (b)   “Damaged or diseased trees.” Trees that have split trunk, broken tops,
heart rot, insect or fungus problems that will lead to imminent death, undercut
root systems that put the tree in imminent danger of falling, lean as a result
of root failure that puts the tree in imminent danger of falling, or any other
condition that puts the tree in imminent danger of being uprooted or falling
into or along a stream or onto a structure.
   (c)   “Defined channel.” A natural or man-made depression in the terrain
which is maintained and altered by the water and sediment it carries.
   (d)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).” The agency with overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (e)   “Final plat.” A final tracing of all or a phase of a subdivision, a
planned residential development, or other land development and its complete
survey information.
   (f)   “Impervious cover.” Any surface that cannot effectively absorb or
infiltrate water. This may include roads, streets, parking lots, rooftops,
sidewalks and other areas not covered by vegetation.
   (g)   “Natural succession.” A gradual and continuous replacement of one kind
of plant and animal group by a more complex group. The plants and animals
present in the initial group modify the environment through their life
activities, thereby making it unfavorable for themselves. They are gradually
replaced by a different group of plants and animals better adapted to the new
environment.
   (h)   “Noxious weed.” Any plant defined as "Prohibited Noxious Weeds" in
Section 901:5-37-01 of the Ohio Administrative Code and any of the following:
Goldenrod, Poison Hemlock, Poison Ivy, Poison Oak, Ragweed, Stinging Nettle,

established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate wetland
quality and function.
   (j)   “100-year floodplain.” Any land susceptible to being inundated by
water from a base flood, which is the flood that has a 1% or greater chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For the purposes of these
regulations, the 100-year floodplain shall be defined by FEMA and subject to
review and approval by the City Engineer.
   (k)   “Ordinary high water mark.” The point of the bank or shore to which
the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a
district marked by erosion, destruction or prevention of woody terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized
characteristic. The ordinary high water mark defines the channel of a stream.
   (l)   “Pollution.” Any contamination or alteration of the physical,
chemical, or biological properties of any waters that will render the waters
harmful or detrimental to: public health, safety or welfare; domestic,
commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, or other legitimate
beneficial uses; livestock, wildlife, including birds, fish or other aquatic
life.
      (1)    “Point source pollution” is traceable to a discrete point or pipe.
      (2)   “Non-point source pollution” is generated by various land use
activities rather than from an identifiable or discrete source, and is conveyed
to waterways through natural processes, such as rainfall, storm runoff or
ground water seepage rather than direct discharge.
   (m)   “Preliminary plan.” A drawing of a major subdivision, planned
residential development, or other land development for the purpose of study and
which, if approved, permits proceeding with the preparation of the final plat.
   (n)   “Riparian area.” A transitional area between flowing water and
terrestrial ecosystems which provides a continuous exchange of nutrients and
woody debris between land and water. This area is at least periodically
influenced by flooding. Riparian areas, if appropriately sized and managed,
help to stabilize banks, limit erosion, reduce flood size flows and/or filter
and settle out runoff pollutants, or perform other functions consistent with
the purposes of these regulations.

to as the SWCD.
   (q)   “Soil-disturbing activity.” Clearing, grading, excavating, filling or
other alteration of the earth’s surface where natural or human-made ground
cover is destroyed, and which may result in, or contribute to, erosion and
sediment pollution.
   (r)   “Stream.” A surface watercourse with a well-defined bed and bank,
either natural or artificial, which confines and conducts continuous or
periodic flowing water in such a way that terrestrial vegetation cannot
establish roots within the channel.
   (s)   “Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).” The plan which
describes all the elements of the storm water strategy implemented during and
after construction. The plan addresses erosion control and storm water quality.
   (t)   “Storm water quality treatment.” The removal of pollutants from urban
runoff and improvement of water quality, accomplished largely by deposition and
utilizing the benefits of natural processes.
   (u)   “Variance.” A modification of the enforcement of this chapter which
will not be contrary to the public interest and where, due to conditions
peculiar to this property and not the result of the action of the applicant, a
literal enforcement of this chapter would result in undue hardship to the
applicant.
   (v)   “Watercourse.” A natural or artificial waterway, such as a stream or
river, with a defined bed and channel and a definite direction of course that
is contained within, flows through or borders the community.
   (w)   “Watershed.” An area of land that drains into a particular
watercourse, usually defined by topography.
   (x)   “Wetlands.” Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or

      (Ord. 25-2006.  Passed 8-10-06.)
1190.05  ESTABLISHMENT OF A RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)   Riparian setbacks are established as provided in this chapter.
   (b)   Streams addressed by this chapter are those which meet the definition
of “stream” in Section
1190.04 and are indicated on at least one of the following maps:
      (1)    USGS topographical map.
      (2)    Applicable County Riparian Setback Map.
      (3)   Soils maps located in the Soil Survey for, as applicable, Summit or
Portage County, Ohio, USDA, NRCS.
      (4)   City of Tallmadge Riparian Setback Map is on file in the Zoning
Department.
   (c)   Widths of setbacks are measured as horizontal map distance outward
from the ordinary high water mark on each side of a stream, and are established
as follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 300 square miles.
      (2)    A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 20 square miles and up to 300 square miles.
      (3)   A minimum of 75 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.5 square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles.
      (4)   A minimum of 50 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.05 square mile (32 acres) and up to 0.5 square mile (320 acres).
      (5)   A minimum of 30 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
less than 0.05 square mile (32 acres).
   (d)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
chapter: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey storm water to another system, tile drainage
systems, and stream culverts.
   (e)    The following shall apply to the riparian setback:
      (1)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than the riparian setback on
either or both sides of the stream, the riparian setback shall be extended to
the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA and subject to review and approval by the City Engineer.
      (2)   A.   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the riparian setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope Width of Setback
15% to 20%            Add 25 feet
21% to 25%            Add 50 feet
>25%                  Add 100 feet
         B.   Average stream bank slope is to be calculated using methodology
outlined in “The Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55)” by USDA, NRCS.
      (3)   Where wetlands protected under Federal or State law are identified
within the riparian setback, the riparian setback shall consist of the full
extent of the wetlands plus the following additional setback widths:
         A.   A 50-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 3 wetlands.
         B.   A 30-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 2 wetlands.
         C.   No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands

guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate
agencies. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the
Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of
application of these regulations.
      (5)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the riparian
setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by subsections 
(b) through (d) hereof, and identifying this setback on all subdivisions, land
development plans, and/or building permit applications. This delineation shall
be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans, or all plans that
are required, or at the time of submission of any permit applications. This
delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the applicable SWCD. As
the result of this review, the SWCD may require further studies from the
applicant.
      (6)   Prior to any soil-disturbing activity, the riparian setback shall
be clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by
the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout
soil- disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained in an
undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these regulations. All fencing
shall be removed when a development project is completed.
      (7)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City prior to
delineation of the riparian setback in conformance with these regulations.
      (8)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, planned residential
development, or other land development, the riparian setback shall be
permanently recorded on the plat records for the City.

1190.06  USES PERMITTED.
   (a)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian setbacks
without prior approval:
      (1)   Open space uses. Open space uses that are passive in character
shall be permitted in the riparian setback, including but not limited to those
listed in divisions (a)(2) through (4) of this section. No use permitted under
these regulations shall be construed as allowing trespass on privately-held
lands. Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited. Except as otherwise
provided in these regulations, the riparian setback shall be preserved in its
natural state.
      (2)   Recreational activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
Federal, State, and local laws, such as hiking, non-motorized bicycling,

including boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables,
and wildlife viewing areas.
      (3)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than 6 inches in diameter shall be anchored to the shore or removed
from the 100-year floodplain.
      (4)   Revegetation and/or reforestation. The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the riparian setback shall be allowed without approval of the
appropriate SWCD. Species of shrubs and vines recommended for stabilizing
flood- prone areas along streams within the City are listed in the Appendix.
   (b)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian setbacks
with prior approval of the design.
      (1)   Stream bank stabilization/erosion control measures. Best management
practices (BMPs) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control may be
allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, State and
Federal government regulations and are ecologically compatible and emphasize
the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical and
available. Such stream bank stabilization/erosion control practices shall only
be undertaken upon approval of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP
or SW3P) by the SWCD.

for individual landowners.
         C.   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be designed
and constructed per the City's design standards and as approved by the City
Planning and Zoning Commission. If more than two crossings per 1,000 linear
feet of stream center are required for these areas, the applicant must apply
for a variance.
         D.   All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the riparian setback and shall mitigate any
necessary disturbances.
      (3)   Placement of storm water retention or detention facilities may be
considered within the riparian setback if:
         A.   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with current
State standards is incorporated into the basin.

deems necessary to control noxious weeds; for such plantings as are consistent
with these regulations; for such disturbances as are approved under these
regulations; and for the passive enjoyment, access and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these regulations.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a landowner to plant or
undertake any other activities in the riparian setback, provided the landowner
allows for natural succession.
   (f)   Parking Lots. There shall be no parking lots or other human made
impervious cover, except as permitted under these regulations.
   (g)   New Surface and/or Subsurface Sewage Disposal or Treatment Area.

      (1)    The expansion conforms to the existing zoning regulations.
      (2)   The expansion must not impact the stream channel or the 100-year
floodplain.
      (3)   The expansion of a nonresidential structure or use must not affect
upstream or downstream hydrologic conditions which could cause damage from
flooding or stream bank erosion to landowners in those areas. A hydrologic
study must be completed by nonresidential applicants only as a process of the
variance application.
      (4)   The expansion of a nonresidential structure or use will not exceed
twenty- five percent (25%) of the footprint area. The twenty-five percent (25%)
expansion limit is per the portion of the structure or use that lies within the
riparian setback.
   (d)   Requests for variances for subdivisions or planned residential
developments (PRD) will be considered for the following:
      (1)   An additional stream crossing or crossings for a subdivision, PRD,
or open space development which is necessary for the health, welfare, and

products or any hazardous materials. Such facilities include, but are not
limited to asphalt plants, dry cleaners, gasoline service stations, and road
maintenance facilities.
      (2)   Facilities which use, store, distribute, or sell products which may
contribute higher than acceptable concentrations of dissolved or particulate
matter to storm water runoff around the facility. Such facilities include, but
are not limited to landfills or transfer stations, junk yards, recycling
facilities, quarries and borrow pits, sand and gravel extraction operations and
road salt storage barns.
   (f)   In reviewing whether to grant variances, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider the following:
      (1)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the functions of
the riparian area. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical
and scientific evidence as provided by the applicant and the agencies listed in
subsections  (a) through (e) hereof.
      (2)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The degree of hardship these regulations place on the applicant and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
         (Ord. 26-2006.  Passed 8-10-06.)
1190.11  INSPECTION.
   (a)    The riparian setback shall be inspected by the applicable SWCD:
      (1)   When a preliminary subdivision plat or other land development plan
is submitted to the City.
      (2)    When a building or zoning permit is requested.
      (3)   Prior to any soil-disturbing activity to inspect the delineation of
the riparian setback as required under these regulations.
   (b)   The riparian setback shall also be inspected annually or as time
permits by the SWCD or approved monitoring entity for compliance with any
approvals under these regulations or at any time evidence is brought to the
attention of the SWCD that uses or structures are occurring that may reasonably
be expected to violate the provisions of these regulations.
   (c)   Violations of these regulations will be handled as noted in Section
1190.02.

Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in or on the
Provider's System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not cause a
violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A Certificate of
Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying with any provisions of
the Code or other applicable law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements.  In addition to a
Certificate of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or
provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state and local
authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide copies of
such documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration issued
pursuant to this chapter shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter, convert
to, or interfere with, the Facilities, Wireless Facilities, Wireless Support
Structures, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable
or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the City.

remitting such invoiced Construction Permit Fee amounts shall be subject to the
penalties of this chapter, the imposition of any other legal or equitable
remedies available to the City and the immediate revocation of any Certificate
of Registration or Construction Permit having been issued.
      (2)   The City may, in addition to the costs listed in subsection (d)(1),
include in the Construction Permit Fee the cost of the value of degradation and
reduction in the useful life of the Rights-of-Way that will result from
Construction that has taken place therein. "Degradation and the reduction in
the useful life" for the purpose of this Section means the accelerated
depreciation of the Rights-of-Way caused by Construction in or disturbance of
the Rights-of-Way, resulting in the need to reconstruct or repair such Rights-
of-Way earlier than would be required if the Construction did not occur.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided herein, no future Construction Permits
shall be issued to an Applicant without payment of all outstanding Construction
Permit Fee invoices. The City shall be exempt from payment of Construction
Permit Fees. Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit that the City

place and time. Joint Applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
Construction Permit Fees.
   (f)   Exceptions to Permit Requirements.  The following shall be excluded
from the requirements of Section
1192.16:
      (1)   The repairing or improvement of streets or other public places
under or by virtue of a contract with the City.
      (2)   The maintenance, planting or removal of trees and shrubs from
within the Right-of-Way.  (Ord. 53-2018.  Passed 6-28-18.)
1192.15  CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial Construction, extension, or
relocation of Facilities in the Rights-of-Way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like Facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the City) or another Permittee, a Permittee shall
conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of Construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Director of Public Service. Where
such
         Construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third
party, every Permittee located within the Rights-of-Way at issue or involved
with the work shall use all Best Efforts to cooperate and assist any other
Permittee or person who is directed by the City to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, but is not limited
to, completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Rights-of-Way along the proposed System
route. Upon request of the Director of Public Service, a Permittee shall also
record and identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights-
of-Way along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section,
general location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights-of-
Way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the
Rights-of-Way.
         D.   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in subsection (a)(1) A. to C. on the Construction Permittee's
proposed System route maps, Construction plans, plan sheets or computer aided
drafting and design (CADD) files, or other data files in a format compatible
with that used by the City.
         E.   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with subsection (a)(1)(4), Permittee has the option of either
utilizing non- destructive digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the
critical points identified to determine as precisely as possible, the
horizontal, vertical and spatial position, composition, size and other
specifications of the conflicting underground facilities, or re-designing the
Construction plans to eliminate the apparent conflict.  A Permittee shall not
excavate more than a three (3) feet by three (3) feet square hole in the
Rights-of-Way to complete this task.
         F.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
      (2)   The Director of Public Service may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed Construction plans.
   (b)   Copy to City.  Upon completion of the tasks described in subsection
(a) hereof, the Construction Permittee shall submit the proposed System route
maps and Construction Plans, with the results of the utility engineering study,
in the most advanced format (including, but not be limited to electronic and/or
digital format) then currently being used by the Provider that is then
currently capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a
readable form) by the City. The mapping data is required to be at the "Atlas"
level of detail necessary for the City to reasonably determine the location of
the Provider's facilities in the Rights-of-Way. The Provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Director of Public Service determines that the
format currently being used by the Provider is not capable of being read by the
City.
   (c)   Qualified Firm.  All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the Permittee if in the discretion of the
Director of Public Service the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete
the project itself; alternatively, utility engineering studies shall be
performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering that is approved by the
City.
   (d)   Cost of Study.  The Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
subsection (a) to (c) hereof.
   (e)   Construction Schedule.  Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter
or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Director of Public Service
waives any of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual
circumstances, a Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction
schedule to the City fourteen (14) business days before commencing any work in
or about the Rights-of-Way, and shall further notify the City not less than two
(2) business days in advance of any excavation in the Rights-of-Way. This
Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under
Section
1192.16(d) (Emergency Situations).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the City's Rules and Regulations.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional Facilities within the Rights-of-Way if the Right-of- Way is
Full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights-of-Way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the Rights-of-Way, the time of year with respect to essential
Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Rights-of-Way, future
City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among Providers.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology.  All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights-of- Way. Specifically, every Permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize Trenchless
Technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, and microtunneling. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable
installed in the subsurface Rights-of-Way pursuant to this chapter may be
required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or
fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to this chapter using "direct bury"
techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions.
      (1)   The City may grant a special exception to the requirements of
subsections (f) and (g) hereof if a Permittee, upon application, demonstrates
with written evidence that:
         A.   The exception will not create any threat to the City's investment
or in the Rights-of-Way, the public health, safety or welfare.
         B.   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the Permittee's Construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the Permittee to provide Services in the City.
         C.   The Permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the Permittee in favor of another Person.
         D.   The requirements requested by the City herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the Permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the City.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights-of-Way
whenever the City finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation. In
instances where the City requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall
waive all applicable Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation,
the Provider shall restore the Rights-of-Way to the same or better condition it
was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to
be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
poles of the same or substantially similar size, or smaller. In accordance with
law, the Director of Public Service may request relocation and/or removal in
order to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City.
         B.   The City's investment in the Right-of-Way.
         C.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights-of-Way.
         D.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a Right-of-Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Rights-of-Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C.  723.041.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its Facilities, as designated by the
City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order, or if a Provider
fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair
of the Rights-of- Way of the City, within twelve (12) months thereafter, then,
to the extent consistent with applicable law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights-of-Way of the City at Provider's cost and expense,
by another Person; however, the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights-of-Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider,
and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any Rights-of-Way excavation, each
Provider who has Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, be responsible to mark the horizontal and approximate
vertical placement of all its Facilities.
      (2)   All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights-of-Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights-of-Way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
City Rules and Regulations. If a Permittee is unable to timely complete the
Restoration of Rights-of- Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the Permittee shall complete the Restoration of the Rights-of-Way as soon as
weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify
the City.
      (2)   In approving an Application for a Construction Permit, the City may
have the Permittee restore the Rights-of-Way or the City may restore the
Rights-of-Way itself at the Permittee's cost if the Permittee has in the past
not abided by requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights-of-
Way, the Permittee shall, at the time of Application for a Construction Permit,
post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the Rights-of-Way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
Restoration of the Rights-of-Way, the City determines that the Rights-of-Way
have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be
released.
      (4)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the City. The City shall have the authority to
prescribe the manner and extent of the Restoration, and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The City in
exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and
considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the Rights-of-Way; the traffic volume carried by the
Rights-of-Way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the Rights-of-Way;
the pre- excavation condition of the Rights-of-Way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the Rights-of-Way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of Restoration to the Permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the Rights-of-Way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
Rights-of-Way; and the likelihood that the particular method of Restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the Rights-of-Way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of Restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the Rights- of-Way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases, milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the Rights-of-Way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the Rights-of-Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Public Service, correct all Restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Service.
Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days
of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Service, unless
otherwise extended by the Department of Public Service.
      (6)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights-of-Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may
do such work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty
(30) days of invoicing, the Restoration cost of restoring the Rights-of-Way and
any other costs incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call
upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all
legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the Permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the City and/or another
Permitee(s), then the Director of Public Service may reasonably apportion the
Restoration responsibility among the City, Providers and/or other Persons.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the Rights-of-Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30)  days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies or the City may call upon any bond or
letter of credit posted by the Permittee and pursue any and all legal or
equitable remedies. Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage caused by its Facilities to the Facilities of another
Provider during the City's response to an Emergency.
      (2)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
City-owned Facilities in the Rights-of-Way that the Provider or its Facilities
damage.
   (m)   Rights-of-Way Vacation.  If the City sells or otherwise transfers a
Right-of-Way that contains the Facilities of a Provider, such sale or transfer
shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements required
pursuant to O.R.C. 723.041.
   (n)   Installation Requirements.  The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights-of-Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, City Rules and Regulations, other
standards as may be promulgated by the Director of Public Service.
   (o)   Inspection.  When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is
completed, the Permittee shall notify the Department of Public Service.
      (1)   The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work that poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or that violates the term and
conditions of the Permit and/or this chapter. The City may inspect the work;
however, the failure of the City to inspect the work does not alleviate the
responsibility of the Permittee to complete the work in accordance with the
approved Permit and the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   The Inspector may issue an order to the Permittee for any work that
does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as
provided in Section
1192.19(d). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Service. The
decision of the Director of Public Service may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance
of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Director of Public
Service that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Director of Public Service may revoke
the Permit.
   (p)   Other Obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other City, county, state or federal laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the Rights-of- Way
pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No Rights-of-Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section
1192.16(d).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a Right-of-Way so as to interfere with
the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other
waterways. The Director of Public Service may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required.  Any owner of property abutting a street or
alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this
chapter, a Provider shall locate Facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of Facilities underground
is consistent with the Provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical Facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A Provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the City, always use Best Efforts to place
Facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and Facilities
installed), all Facilities to be installed by a Provider under the Right-of-Way
shall be installed in conduit.  (Ord. 53-2018.  Passed 6-28-18.)
1192.16  ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit.  Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any Person who has not yet made an Application or who is
occupying any Right-of-Way without a valid Certificate of Registration; or
      (2)   To any Person who has outstanding debt owed to the City unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the City
Director of Finance and the Law Director; or
      (3)   To any Person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a Permit in accordance with the provisions contained herein; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Service, the
issuance of a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict
or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Director of Public Service, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights-of-
Way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare
and/or the City's investment in the Right-of-Way.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit.  The Director of Public Service may deny
a Permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and/or
protect the City's investment in the Right-of-Way to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights-of-Way, or when
necessary to protect the Rights-of-Way and its users.
      (1)   The Director of Public Service, in his/her discretion, may consider
one or more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which Rights-of-Way space where the Permit is
sought is available; and/or
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the Rights-of-
Way; and/or
         C.   The availability of other locations in the Rights-of-Way or in
other Rights-of-Way for the proposed Facilities; and/or
         D.   The applicability of this chapter or other regulations of the
Rights-of-Way that affect location of Facilities in the Rights-of-Way; and/or
         E.   The degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and
conditions of its Certificate of Registration, this chapter, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Rights-of-Way;
and/or
         G.   The condition and age of the Rights-of-Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the Rights-of-Way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the Rights-of-Way; and/or
         I.   Whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of this chapter, or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on any street
except where:
         A.   An Emergency situation constitutes that an open cut is necessary;
and/or
         B.   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         C.   The Director of Public Service determines it is in the best
interests of the City that such an open cut take place.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2), the
Director of Public Service may issue a Permit in any case in which the Permit
is necessary;
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
Permit Applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
or
         B.   To allow such customer to improve its Service; or
         C.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
Permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a Permit under this section, the Permit Applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
Service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without A Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each Provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Director of Public Service of any event regarding its Facilities which it
considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within five (5) business
days, unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Service, after the
occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider
shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith or
have those fees attributed to its quarterly invoice balance in accordance with
section Q(4) and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this chapter for any and all actions taken in response to
the Emergency. In the event that the City becomes aware of an Emergency
regarding a Provider's Facilities, the City may use Best Efforts to contact the
Provider or the System Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it
deems necessary in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an Emergency, any Provider who Constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a Rights-of-Way without a valid
Permit must subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double the calculated fee for
said Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with
the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Rights-of-Way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to this chapter as a
privilege and not as a right. The City reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a failure of
the Permittee to comply with the terms and conditions of any law, ordinance,
rule or regulation, or Design Guidelines where applicable, or any provision or
condition of the Permit, including, but not limited to the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
         C.   Any misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a Permit; or
         D.   The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete the Construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued.
      (2)   If the Director of Public Service determines that the Permittee has
not complied with a term or condition of any law, ordinance, rule or
regulation, or any condition of the Permit, the Director of Public Service
shall serve a written demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The
demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
Permit. The Director of Public Service may also, in his/ her discretion, place
additional or revised conditions on the Permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the violation, Permittee shall contact the Director of Public
Service with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Service, for its
correction. Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's
failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the Permit.
      (4)   If a Permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and the Permittee will
not be allowed further Permits for up to and including one (1) full year from
the date that the Permit was revoked, except for Emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.  (Ord. 53-2018.  Passed 6-28-18.)
1192.17  PERFORMANCE SECURITY.
   (a)   Required Bond.  Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration, and
prior to the commencement of any Construction, and continuously thereafter, a
Provider shall deposit with the Director of Public Service and maintain an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount
determined by the Director of Public Service to be appropriate based upon fair
and reasonable criteria. The full amount of the letter of credit or surety bond
shall remain in full force and effect throughout the terms and conditions of
this chapter and/or until any necessary site restoration is completed to
restore the site to a condition comparable or better to that which existed
prior to the issuance of Certificate of Registration. Unless a Construction
default, problem, or deficiency involves an Emergency or endangers the safety
of the general public, the Director of Public Service shall make all reasonable
efforts to allow a Provider a period of five (5) calendar days after sending
notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency
prior to Director of Public Service' attachment of the letter of credit or
surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the Provider
by the Director of Public Service.
   (b)   Purposes.
      (1)   The letter of credit or surety bond required by this section shall
serve as security for:
         A.   The faithful performance by the Permittee or Provider of all
terms, conditions and obligations of this chapter; and
         B.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned
by the Permittee or Provider's violation of this chapter or its failure to
comply with all rules, regulations, orders, Permits and other directives of the
City issued pursuant to this chapter; and
         C.   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including Permit
Fees; and
         D.   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance
required pursuant to this chapter; and
         E.   The removal of Facilities from the Rights-of-Way pursuant to this
chapter; and
         F.   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the Permittee or
Provider is liable that are not paid by its insurance or other surety; and
         G.   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to this chapter or law.
            (Ord. 53-2018.  Passed 6-28-18.)
1192.18  INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   City Does Not Accept Liability.
      (1)   By reason of the acceptance of an Application, the grant of a
Permit or the issuance of a Certificate of Registration, the City does not
assume any liability:
         A.   For injuries to Persons, damage to property, or loss of Service
claims; or
         B.   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance or operation of Facilities.
   (b)   Indemnification.
      (1)   By applying for and being issued a Certificate of Registration with
the City a Provider is required, or by accepting a Permit a Permittee is
required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs,
liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the
Construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
Facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a Right-of-Way,
whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a Permit, unless the act or omission is due to the City's negligence or
willful acts. A Provider or Permittee shall not bring, nor cause to be brought,
any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other
relief against the City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers, and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of
the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its Facilities, or any
activity undertaken in or near a Right-of-Way, whether the act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a Permit. This Section is
not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise
available to the Provider, Permittee or to the City; and the Provider or
Permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to
assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in
its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but
not limited to, the following:
         A.   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all Providers and
Permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the City, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation workers' compensation claims against the City or
others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith), unless the act or
omission is due to the City's negligence or willful acts; and
            1.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of Provider or Permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the Provider or Permittee of the
Rights-of-Way, to which Provider's or Permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the negligence of any other party shall
have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury or damage;
and
            2.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the Provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the City's actions; and
            3.   Arising out of Provider or Permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of law applicable to Provider or Permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
         A.   Giving Provider or Permittee prompt notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought; and
         B.   Affording the Provider or Permittee the opportunity to
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperate in the defense of such claim and making available to
the Provider or Permittee all pertinent information under the City's control.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the Provider or Permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel if employed.
         (Ord. 53-2018.  Passed 6-28-18.)
1192.19  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Non-exclusive Remedy.  The remedies provided in this chapter are not
exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City may have at law
or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek legal and
equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the Rights-of-Way,
including damages to the Rights-of-Way, whether caused by a violation of any of
the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of the City Code of
Ordinances.
   (b)   Severability.  If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase,
or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a
regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a
final, non-appealable order that any Permit, right or any portions of this
section are illegal or unenforceable, then any such Permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable Permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60)
days written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable Permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in
the Permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating
to the term of the Permit and the right of termination. If a Permit or right
shall be considered a revocable Permit as provided herein, the Permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable Permit and the
power to revoke it.
   (c)   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers.  The City, by the
granting of a Permit or by issuing a Certificate of Registration pursuant to
this chapter, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or
lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter
vested in the City under the Constitution and laws of the United States, State
of Ohio and under the Charter of the City to regulate the use of the Rights-of-
Way. The Permittee by its acceptance of a Permit, or Provider by applying for
and being issued a Certificate of Registration, is deemed to acknowledge that
all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise
as now are or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the
City, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by
the City at any time. A Permittee or Provider is deemed to acknowledge that its
rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public
and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws and
ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.
   (d)   Method of Service.  Any notice or order of the Director of Public
Service or Mayor shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is:

CHAPTER 1194
Flood Damage Reduction
1194.01   General provisions.
1194.02   Definitions.
1194.03   Administration.
1194.04   Use and development standards for flood hazard reduction.
1194.05   Appeals and variances.
1194.06   Enforcement.
1194.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Tallmadge, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Tallmadge has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and  generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near floodprone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Tallmadge, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Tallmadge.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Summit County, Ohio and incorporated
areas and flood insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Summit County, Ohio and incorporated
Areas both effective July 20, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Tallmadge.
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the office of the Clerk of Council of the City of
Tallmadge, 46 North Avenue, Tallmadge, Ohio 44278.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by these regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.    In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Tallmadge, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 71-2009.  Passed 5-14-09.)

   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE).    The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding.  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus zero (0) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Tallmadge's historic preservation program, at such time the program
is certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)    Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      (2)    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)    Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest Floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured Home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured Home Park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal Government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal Government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New Construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Tallmadge Flood
Insurance Rate Map, April 15, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (aa)   Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined as any
governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the General
Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or any
court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the laws of the State of Ohio.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under the laws of the State of Ohio.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under the laws of the State of Ohio.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of Construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.  (Ord. 71-2009.  Passed 5-14-09.)

these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit application
shall be reviewed until all required information under this Chapter has been
received by the Floodplain Administrator.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall review all floodplain
development permit applications to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which
prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining
such permits as required including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under the Rivers and Harbors Act and the Clean Water Act, and the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval.  Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one (1) year. A floodplain development permit
shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections.  The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required.  The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued:
      (1)   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a
Federal Emergency Management Agency Elevation Certificate completed by a
registered surveyor to record as-built elevation data.  For elevated structures

permit is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Tallmadge flood maps, studies and other data accurately
represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are
based on current data, the following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with this chapter.
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have all technical
data prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or
Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees
for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this chapter.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Director of Public
Service and the Mayor of the City of Tallmadge, and may be submitted at any
time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Tallmadge have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Tallmadge's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the City of
Tallmadge boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Tallmadge suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Tallmadge has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make a reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data required by
this chapter;
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Director of Public Service and the Mayor of
the City of Tallmadge and the Chief Executive or other appropriate officer of
any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Compliance with Section
1194.04(i)(1)B, items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Tallmadge specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data required by this chapter when an alteration of a watercourse results in
the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with this Chapter.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing on form(s)
provided by the City together with payment of the required fee pursuant to
Chapter
1137, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator.
Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said
notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's
decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application shall be on a form provided by the City and at a
minimum shall contain the following information: Name, address, and telephone
number of the applicant; legal description of the property; parcel map;
description of the existing use; description of the proposed use; location of
the floodplain; description of the variance sought; and reason for the variance
request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City
Council of the City of Tallmadge.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall be granted upon a finding of:
         A.   Good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
            Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1194.05(d)(2) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Summit County or Portage County Court of
Common Pleas as appropriate, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
      (Ord. 71-2009.  Passed 5-14-09.)
1194.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless expressly exempted under this chapter from filing for a
development permit.
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefor, including but
not limited to the property owner, operator, agent, applicant, or other person,
and order compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such

of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the person of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Service shall be made in person or by certified mail to the
person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/or a
copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the property affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined and/or
incarcerated as provided by the laws of the City of Tallmadge.  Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City of Tallmadge from taking such other lawful

      (Ord. 24-2019.  Passed 2-28-19.)
1195.10  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description and location of all appropriate BMPs for
each construction operation.  Prior to the start of grading and within seven
days from the start of grubbing, the applicant must implement such controls. 
The SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the
appropriate control measures; the general sequence during the construction
process under which the measures will be implemented; and the person(s)
responsible for implementation.
   (a)   No project subject to this Chapter shall commence without a SWP3 or
Abbreviated SWP3 approved by the SWCD and/or City Engineer.
   (b)   No project subject to this Chapter shall commence without a pre-
construction meeting, if required, being held with the City Engineer and/or
SWCD.  It will be the developer or land owner’s responsibility to contact the
SWCD and/or City Engineer.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   1.   DURING ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION.
      (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The applicant must make use
of practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
         (1)   Stream protection.  The requirements of the T.C.O. Chapter
1190 for Riparian Setbacks shall be followed.
         (2)   Wetland Protection.  The setback requirements of the City
Subdivision and Zoning Regulations shall be followed in addition to County,
State, and Federal regulations.
      (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The applicant must make use of erosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  A
description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after
grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. 
      (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES:  The applicant must make use of measures
that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. 
Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to
direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
      (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES:  The applicant must install structural
practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert
flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. 
Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment from a
site remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days.  Such practices may
include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond.  All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or
channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless used in
conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
      (e)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The
applicant must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic
materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources
or wetlands.
      (f)   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS:  The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
      (g)   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL: There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant- laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
      (h)   INTERNAL INSPECTIONS:  All controls on the site shall be inspected
by the applicant’s agent at least once every seven calendar days and within 24
hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour
period. The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct
these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to
evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures
are required.  Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge
and experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
      (i)   MAINTENANCE:  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization.  All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization.  The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the SWCD.
   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
         (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance.  If an inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function.  If an
inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
      (j)   FINAL STABILIZATION: Final stabilization is reached when 75% of the
disturbed area has been protected from erosion by vegetation, clean stone,
pavement, or other acceptable means.
   2.   POST CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY PRACTICES.
      (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Non-structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
         (1)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
         (2)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected in
perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed to potential
buyers.
      (b)   STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Structural post construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration.
         (1)   All structural water quality practices must be established prior
to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices should be
made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If detention/
retention facilities were used for sediment control during development,
sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post construction
storm water quality.
         (2)   MAINTENANCE. The post construction water quality practice must
be maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWPPP, the
applicable recorded plat, or other maintenance requirements of the City.

1196.04  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Compliance with the provisions of this regulation shall not relieve any
person from responsibility for damage to any person otherwise imposed by law.
The provisions of this regulation are promulgated to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the public and are not designed for the benefit of any
individual or for the benefit of any particular parcel of property.
(Ord. 87-2012.  Passed 12-13-12.)
1196.05  CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this regulation is in conflict with other provisions of law or
ordinance, the most restrictive provisions, as determined by the City of
Tallmadge, shall prevail.
   (b)   If any clause, section, or provision of this regulation is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   This regulation shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a nuisance on their property, and compliance with the provisions of
this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate such a nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the City of Tallmadge to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
site owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting
therefrom, and shall not result in the City of Tallmadge, its officers,
employees, or agents being responsible for any condition or damage resulting
therefrom. 
(Ord. 87-2012.  Passed 12-13-12.)
1196.06  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.

(Ord. 87-2012.  Passed 12-13-12.)
1196.07  DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause
to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement, conduct,
or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City of
Tallmadge to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Tallmadge as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007, and permitted by the Summit County
Public Health or the Portage County Health Department for the purpose of
discharging treated sewage effluent in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code
3701-29, or other applicable Summit County Public Health or the Portage County
Health Department regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health
nuisance by the Summit County Public Health or the Portage County Health
Department. Discharges from new or replacement off-lot household sewage
treatment systems installed after January 1, 2007, are not exempt from the
requirements of this regulation.
   In compliance with the City of Tallmadge Storm Water Management Program,
discharges from all offlot discharging household sewage treatment systems must
either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued
and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection agency. When such permit
coverage is available for systems existing prior to January 1, 2007, discharges
from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems existing prior to
January 1, 2007, will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.
         (Ord. 87-2012.  Passed 12-13-12.)
1196.08  MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program. The City of Tallmadge shall establish a program to detect
and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This
program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and
household sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water
outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry
weather flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)   The City of Tallmadge shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to this regulation as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this regulation.
      (2)   The City of Tallmadge shall have the right to set up at facilities
subject to this regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge, as determined by the
City of Tallmadge.
      (3)   The City of Tallmadge shall have the right to require the facility
owner/operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operator's
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated by the City of Tallmadge or Summit County Public Health or the
Portage County Health Department to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility's owner/operator at the written or oral request of the City of
Tallmadge and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Tallmadge access to a
facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the City of Tallmadge is refused access to any part of the
facility from which storm water is discharged, and the City of Tallmadge
demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the City of Tallmadge may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator. 
(Ord. 87-2012.  Passed 12-13-12.)

required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing. If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, the City of
Tallmadge shall schedule an administrative hearing to determine reasons for
non-compliance and to determine the next enforcement activity. Notice of the
administrative hearing shall be hand delivered and/or sent registered mail.
Such administrative hearing shall be before the Director of Public Service, the
Director of Law, and the Chairperson of the Public Utilities Committee of
Council.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3709.211. If an owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the City of Tallmadge

preferential treatment of types or classes, of materials or products or methods
of construction.
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practicable, the standardization of

which are now or may become in the future substandard with respect to
structure, maintenance or other similar conditions which otherwise constitute a

standards.

regulation or other regulation, the provision which establishes the higher
standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and health of the
people shall prevail.
   (d)   Existing Remedies.  Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to abolish,
impair, or prevent the execution of any existing remedies of the City of
Tallmadge or its officers or agents related to the abatement of a public
nuisance.  The provisions in this Code shall not be construed to abolish or
impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or agencies
relating to the removal or demolition of any structure which is dangerous or
unsafe.
   (e)   Separability.  If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence,
clause, or phrase of this Code is declared invalid for any reason, such
declaration shall not affect the remaining portions of this Code, which shall
continue in full force and effect, and to this end, the provisions of this
Property Maintenance Code are deemed severable.
   (f)   Savings Clause.  This Code shall not affect violations of any other
resolution, ordinance, code or regulation existing prior to the effective date

and shall continue to be punishable to the full extent of the law under the
provisions of those ordinances, codes or regulations in effect at the time the
