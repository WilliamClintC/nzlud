§ 1.  General powers.  The people of Indian Hill, as its territorial
limits are now or may hereafter be, shall be a body politic and corporate by
the name of "the Village of Indian Hill," and shall, as a village or a city,
have perpetual succession.  It is the purpose and intent of the people of
Indian Hill that the character and uses of the area within the village may
not be changed, and that it shall continue to be a rural neighborhood of
homes and farms.  The village shall have all the powers of local self
government and home rule and under this Charter exercise all powers of local
self-government possible for a municipality to have under the Constitution of
Ohio, and all other powers which may be granted to municipalities by the law
of Ohio including all statutes now or hereafter enacted. All such powers
shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this Charter, or if not
expressly prescribed therein, in such a manner as shall be provided by
ordinance of council.



(Amendment adopted by voters 11-8-94)



§ 2.  Powers and term. All legislative powers of the village, except as
reserved in this Charter to the electors, shall be vested in a council of 7
members, elected by the electors of the village at large.  Members of
council shall be residents of the village and shall serve terms of 2 years
beginning on the first day of December following their election.



§ 3.  Attendance and vacancies.  If any member shall be absent from 3
consecutive regular meetings of council without valid excuse acceptable to a
majority of the other members, council may by resolution declare his seat
vacant, but no member shall be otherwise penalized for non-attendance at
meetings.  Council shall declare vacant the seat of any member who shall
cease to be a resident or qualified elector of the village, or shall hold any
other public office or employment, except that of mayor of the village,
notary, member of the armed forces of Ohio or the United States, or trustee
or director without pay of a public institution.  The remaining members of
council shall, by majority vote, elect a successor to fill any vacancy
however caused.



§ 4.  Meetings.  Council shall hold not less than six (6) regular meetings
per annum at any time and place designated by rule or ordinance.  Special
meetings may be called by the mayor or by any three (3) members on 12 hours
personal notice.  All meetings of council and of its committees shall be
open to the public except Executive Sessions as provided for by Ohio
statute.  A majority of the members elected to council shall constitute a
quorum to do business, but a less number may adjourn from time to time. 
Every ordinance shall be read on three (3) separate days before its passage
unless such requirement is dispensed with by a vote of at least five (5)
members of council.  The vote of at least majority of the members, except as
otherwise prescribed in this Charter, shall be necessary to the passage of
any measure, and all votes shall be taken by yeas and nays entered upon the
journal.  Council may adopt rules, not inconsistent with this Charter,
governing its own proceedings and all other matters pertaining to the
exercise of its powers and performance of its duties.



(Amendment adopted by voters 11-2-99)



§ 5.  Effective date of measures.  Measures passed by council shall,
unless a later date be specified therein, take effect as follows:



   (A)     Measures to which the referendum is not applicable,
immediately upon passage;



   (B)     Emergency measures, except public utility franchise or rate
ordinances, to which council has by a vote of at least 5 members added a
section declaring that such measure is necessary for the preservation from
immediate danger of the public peace, property, health, safety or welfare, or
is necessary for the daily operation of a department or office of the village
and also stating specifically the reason for such necessity, immediately upon
passage; and



   (C)     All other measures, on the first day of the third month
after passage, unless a referendum petition in respect thereof has been filed
within 45 days after passage by council.



§ 6.  Publication.  All measures of council shall be authenticated,
recorded, and published or not published, all in such manner as the council
may from time to time by ordinance provide.



§ 7.  Establishment and discontinuance of offices.  Council shall not,
except in the case of the treasurer, abolish any office, or diminish or
transfer any powers or duties prescribed in this Charter.  Council may by
ordinance establish, abolish, divide, or combine, and may determine the
functions, powers, and duties of any office or department not prescribed in
this charter.



§ 8.  The Mayor.  Council shall at the regular December meeting following
its election choose by majority vote one of its members as mayor to serve the
remainder of his current term.  The mayor shall in addition to his powers,
rights, and duties as a member of council preside at all its meetings, and
shall be recognized as the official head of the village for all ceremonial
purposes, by the governor for military purposes, and by the courts for the
purpose of serving civil process.  The mayor shall perform all other duties
prescribed for him in this Charter, and such mayoral duties as may be imposed
upon him by any measure of council.  The mayor shall also have jurisdiction
in civil and criminal cases as provided by the laws of Ohio including all
statutes now or hereafter enacted, until such jurisdiction is placed
elsewhere by law.



§ 9.  The vice-mayor. Council shall at the regular December meeting
following its election choose one of its members as vice-mayor, to serve
during the remainder of his current term.  The vice-mayor shall exercise all
the powers and perform all the duties of the mayor in case of the temporary
absence or disability of the mayor and shall succeed to his office in case of
any vacancy therein.



§ 10.  Clerk.  Council shall choose a clerk to serve during its
pleasure.  The clerk shall attend all meetings of council and keep its
records and shall perform all other duties prescribed for him in this Charter
and such secretarial duties as may be imposed upon him by any measure of
council.



§ 11.  Powers defined. The initiative and referendum are reserved by this
Charter to the people of the Village of Indian Hill, to be exercised as
prescribed in this Charter.  Electors, not less in number than 1/5 of those
who voted at the preceding general election, may by an initiative petition
propose to council the passage of an ordinance set forth therein, or by a
referendum petition propose the repeal of any measure passed within 45 days
by council, except as otherwise prescribed in this Charter.



§ 12.  The petition. The form, content, verification of and other
requirements for initiative and referendum petitions, except as otherwise
prescribed in this Charter, shall be controlled by the laws of Ohio including
all statutes now or hereafter enacted.  The petition shall be filed with the
clerk and within 10 days thereafter he shall determine whether it is valid
and sufficient, according to law, and shall present the petition, with a
certificate as to his determination, to council at its next regular
meeting.  If the petition is determined to be invalid or insufficient, no
further action shall be had.



§ 13.  The initiative. Each ordinance initiated by a petition certified to
be valid and sufficient shall upon presentation be referred by council to a
committee to hold a public hearing thereon, and to report its recommendations
at the next regular meeting of council.  Council shall, not later than the
second regular meeting following such reference, either pass the ordinance in
its original form, or take such action as may be required to submit the
ordinance to a vote of the electors at a regular or special election to be
held within 4 months thereafter.  If an initiated ordinance is approved by a
majority of the electors voting thereon, it shall be an ordinance of the
village, and shall take effect immediately unless another date is specified
therein.  Any resolution proposed by initiative petition for the purpose of
terminating a contract for fire or police services shall be submitted to a
vote of the electors, without other action by council than may be required to
ensure an election thereon as promptly as possible.



§ 14.  The referendum. The referendum shall not be applicable to: (1)
ordinances making or transferring annual appropriations, or amendments
thereto; (2) measures providing for the discharge of any obligation legally
due from the village; (3) measures submitting any measure to a vote of the
electors; (4) measures directing the performance of any official duty or
providing for investigations or reports; (5) resolutions not having the force
or effect of law; (6) repealing measures passed by the council pursuant to
referendum petitions; or (7) measures relating to any subsequent to the
ordinance determining to proceed.  The referendum shall be applicable to all
emergency measures, but the filing of a referendum petition shall not prevent
the taking effect thereof.  The taking effect of all other measures shall be
postponed by the filing of a referendum petition within 45 days after the
passage thereof, unless the clerk shall certify that it is invalid or
insufficient. Each repealing measure proposed by a referendum petition
certified to be valid and sufficient shall upon presentation be referred by
council to a committee to hold a public hearing thereon, and to report its
recommendations at the next regular meeting of council.  Council shall, not
later than the second regular meeting following such reference, either pass
the repealing measure or take such action as may be required to submit it to
a vote of the electors at a regular or special election to be held within 4
months thereafter.  If the repealing measure is approved by a majority of
the electors voting thereon, the repeal shall take effect immediately;
otherwise the measure shall either remain in effect or take effect
immediately.



§ 15.  Taxes. Council shall have the authority to levy taxes given to
councils of municipalities by the laws of the State of Ohio.  (Amendment
adopted by voters 11-3-70)



§ 16.  The budget.  On or before the first day of November in each year
the village manager shall prepare and submit to council an appropriation
budget presenting a financial plan for conducting the affairs of the village
for the ensuing calendar year.  Council shall by ordinance specify the form
of and the information to be included in the appropriation budget.  Council
shall immediately refer the appropriation budget to a committee to hold a
public hearing thereon during the month of November.  The appropriation
budget in its original form or as amended by the committee shall be reported
to council at its meeting in December.



§ 17.  Compensation to officers. Members of council, the mayor, and
vice-mayor, and members of the village planning commission shall receive no
salary or other compensation for their services.  The salaries, fees, and
other compensation payable to other officers, subordinates, employees,
agents, or other persons, for services rendered to or on behalf of the
village, shall be fixed by ordinance, or by the village manager within limits
established by ordinance.



§ 18.  Annual audits. Council shall, within the first six (6) months of
each year, cause an annual audit of all the financial affairs of the Village
during the preceding year to be made by a certified public accountant not in
the employ of the Village or financially interested in any transaction to be
audited.  If, however, any representative of the State of Ohio is then
making or is about to make such an audit pursuant to law, Council may accept
such audit in lieu of causing an annual audit to be made hereunder. Council
may, in addition, cause other audits for any purpose to be made at any other
time.



(Amendment adopted by voters 11-8-94)



§ 19.  Capital improvement reserve.



   (A)  Council shall create and maintain a capital improvement reserve
fund and shall transfer or appropriate thereto the unencumbered balance
remaining in the general fund of the village at the end of each fiscal year;
provided, however, that council shall retain in the general fund at the end
of each fiscal year for general fund purposes for the succeeding fiscal year
the lesser of:



      (1)  The year end balance of the general fund, or



      (2)  An amount equal to 20% of the aggregate general fund
expenditures for the fiscal year then ended.



   (B)  The foregoing moneys so retained shall not be taken into account
in preparing the appropriations budget for the ensuing year.  (Amendment
adopted by voters 11-2-76)



§ 20.  Appointment and removal.  Council shall appoint a village manager,
who may or may not be a resident of the village or the state, to serve during
the pleasure of council.  No member of council shall during his term in
office be appointed village manager.  The village manager may be removed at
the pleasure of council after a public hearing on the reasons for such
removal.  Council may designate some qualified person to exercise the rights
and perform the duties of the village manager during his absence or temporary
disability or during a temporary vacancy.



§ 21.  Rights and duties.  The village manager shall be the conservator of
the peace within the village,  the administrator of its business and the
executive of all its affairs.  He may act as the head of any department or
office under his control.  He shall see that the contracts and ordinances of
the village and the laws of Ohio are enforced, make such recommendations to
council concerning the affairs of the village as may seem to him desirable,
keep council advised of the financial condition and future needs of the
village, prepare and submit an annual report and such other reports as may be
required, issue all licenses and permits pursuant to ordinance, and perform
all other duties prescribed for him in this Charter, or imposed upon him by
any measure of council.  The village manager, together with such
subordinates as he may designate, shall be entitled to sit with council and
the village planning commission at all meetings and to take part in any
discussion, but shall have no vote.



§ 22.  The village solicitor. The village manager shall appoint a village
solicitor for an indefinite term, who shall be an attorney-at-law admitted to
practice in Ohio, but who may or may not be a resident of the village.  He
shall be the legal advisor of and attorney and counsel for the village and
for all officers and departments thereof in all matters relating to their
official duties, and shall when requested give legal opinions in writing. 
He shall represent the village in all suits or cases in which it may be a
party, and shall prosecute for all offenses against the ordinances of the
village and such offenses against the laws of Ohio as may be required of him
by law.  He shall, on request of the village manager, prepare all contracts,
bonds and other instruments in writing in which the village is concerned, and
shall endorse on each his approval of the form and correctness thereof.  He
shall perform all other duties of a legal nature imposed on him by any
measure of council, or imposed upon the chief legal officers of
municipalities by a general law of Ohio which such municipalities are not
entitled to modify.



§ 23.  The treasurer. The village manager may appoint a treasurer for an
indefinite term, who may or may not be a resident of the village. The
treasurer shall receive, collect, and deposit all moneys due to the village,
and countersign all checks and vouchers for their disbursement.  He shall be
the custodian of official bonds and of instruments for the payment of moneys
to the village.  Council may, after December 31, 1943, abolish the office of
treasurer and transfer his powers and duties to the comptroller.



§ 24.  The comptroller.  The village manager shall appoint a comptroller
for an indefinite term, who may or may not be a resident of the village. 
The comptroller shall be the fiscal and accounting officer of the village,
and shall also perform all other financial duties imposed on him by any
measure of council.



§ 25.  Appointments and removals.  The village manager shall appoint for
an indefinite term and may promote all subordinates and employees in the
service of the village, except as otherwise prescribed in this Charter. 
Council shall by ordinance establish rules and regulations governing the
classified and non-classified service requiring that all such appointments
and promotions shall be made by the Village Manager according to merit and
fitness.  Council shall issue by ordinance regulations to facilitate the
administration of such rules and regulations.  This section and the
ordinances and regulations pursuant hereto shall be exclusive as to the
personnel and civil service of the village and are intended to supersede any
provision of state civil service law with which it may conflict.  Any
officer, subordinate, or employee appointed by the Village Manager may be
laid off, suspended, reduced in rank, or removed by the Village Manager, and
his action shall be final. The Village Manager shall have full authority to
leave positions under a single position whenever he deems it in the best
interest of the city.



Classified positions may be filled by appointment or promotion.  Such
positions shall be filled by a competitive examination, insofar as
practicable, and when a vacancy occurs in such position, the Personnel
Director shall notify the Village Manager of that fact and the Personnel
Director shall certify to the Village Manager, for each such vacancy to be
filled, the names and addresses of three (3) candidates with the highest
rating as established by the competitive examination and other criteria
established by council and the Village Manager may appoint or promote one of
the persons so certified.  This procedure is intended to supersede any state
civil service statute with which it conflicts.



(Amendment adopted by voters 11-8-94)



§ 26.  Purchases. The village manager shall purchase all things required by
the village.  Purchases may be made simultaneously with purchases by other
governmental bodies and in cooperation with their officers.  No purchase
shall be made in an amount which exceeds the applicable statute of the State
of Ohio except after advertisement and the receipt of bids in writing unless
in case of emergency which will not admit of delay, and in any such case, the
village manager shall report the facts to council at its next meeting. 
(Amendment adopted by voters 11-3-70)



§ 27.  Contracts.  The village manager shall execute and deliver all
contracts for the village, except contracts for annual audits which shall be
executed by the mayor.  No contract involving an expenditure of more than
$500.00, or an expenditure out of the general fund in a year after the date
of the contract, or an expenditure for expert or professional services shall
be made unless authorized by ordinance.  No contract involving the
expenditure of more than $500.00 for the construction, maintenance or repair
of any public work or improvement by a private contractor shall be made,
except after advertisement and the receipt of bids in writing, unless in case
of an emergency which will not admit of delay; and, in such case, the village
manager shall report the facts to council at its next meeting.  No contract,
except as otherwise prescribed in this Charter, shall be made for a term
longer than 5 years.



§ 28.  Interference by council. Neither council, nor its committees or
members shall direct or request the appointment of any person to, or his
removal from office by the village manager, or in any manner take part in the
appointment, discipline, or removal of subordinates and employees in the
administrative service of the village.  Council, its committees, and its
members shall deal with that portion of the service of the village for which
the village manager is responsible solely through the village manager, and
neither council, nor its committees or members, shall give any orders to any
subordinate of the village manager.  In case any member shall be found by
council to have violated this section, council shall declare his seat
vacant.  Council may, however, inquire into the conduct of any office or
department, the performance of any contract, or any of the affairs of the
village, and may in the exercise of such power compel, or authorize a
committee to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the
production of books, papers, and other evidence under penalty of law.



§ 29.  Police and fire.  The village shall have all powers to organize and
maintain a police department and a fire department, granted to municipalities
by the constitution and the laws of Ohio including all statutes now or
hereafter enacted.  By reason of such powers or  otherwise, the village
shall have power to enter into contracts obligating Ohio corporations, not
for profit, to render for periods not exceeding 10 years any or all police
services within the jurisdictional limits of the village, including the
preservation of the peace, the protection of persons and property and the
obedience and enforcement of ordinances and all criminal laws, and also any
or all fire protection services within the territorial limits of the village,
including the protection of lives and property in case of fire.  It is the
desire and intent of the people of Indian Hill that the village shall
contract for police services with the Indian Hill Rangers, and for fire
protection services with the Madeira and Vicinity Fire Department Company,
and that the village shall pay the costs thereof.  Each contract shall
provide that any provision thereof may be modified by mutual agreement for
the purpose of improving or extending the services to be rendered; and that
it may be terminated before expiration, by a vote of at least 5 members of
council if public safety is endangered because of any inadequacy of the
services, or by a resolution proposed by initiative petition and approved by
a majority of the electors voting thereon.  Council may negotiate and agree
upon all other details of each contract including the amounts payable
thereunder, and may cause the properly qualified employees of the
corporations, respectively, to be vested with all the powers granted to the
members of police or fire departments of municipalities by the laws of Ohio
including all statutes now or hereafter enacted.



§ 30.  Contracts for other services. Council may, by a resolution passed by
the vote of at least 5 members, authorize the village manager to contract for
any governmental services other than police and fire protection to be
rendered to the village and its people, including the building, repair, and
maintenance of streets and other public ways for a period not exceeding 5
years, or for the furnishing of water for a period not exceeding 10 years.



§ 31.  Appointment.  The village planning commission shall consist of 5
members, one a member of council, and 4 electors of the village, and shall be
appointed by council to serve as follows:  the member and his successors,
until their respective terms in council expire; and one of the 4 electors,
until January 1, 1944; one, until January 1, 1946; one, until January 1,
1948; one, until January 1, 1950, and their successors for terms of 8 years,
each.



§ 32.  Powers and duties.  The village planning commission shall have all
the powers granted to and shall perform all the duties imposed upon planning
commissions and platting commissioners by the laws of Ohio including all
statutes now or hereafter enacted.  The village planning commission shall
also prepare a building code regulating the construction of buildings and
other structures within the village, and from time to time amendments thereto
as required.



§ 33.  Action by the council.  The village planning commission shall file
with council ordinances embodying any plans, recommendation, report, building
code, or amendment.  Each ordinance so filed shall be referred at the next
regular meeting to a committee to hold a public hearing thereon.  The
committee shall report its recommendations and council shall, not later than
the second regular meeting following such reference, either pass or reject
the ordinance, but no change shall be made therein without the consent of the
village planning commission or, if such consent is not given, without the
vote of at least 5 members of council.  Any amendment to such ordinances
shall be submitted to the village planning commission, and, unless it shall
approve or fail to report within 25 days or such longer time as may be
specified, no amendment may be passed without a vote of at least 5 members.



§ 34.  Appeals. Appeals on the ground of undue hardship from any decision,
made by the village manager in the administration of any such ordinances, may
be taken to the village planning commission and shall be finally determined
by the vote of not less than 3 of the members thereof.



§ 35.  Nominations and elections.  Nominations shall be made, form of
ballots determined and all elections held and conducted pursuant to the laws
of Ohio including all statutes now or hereafter enacted, applicable to the
nomination and election of officers of villages of less than 2,000 population.



§ 36.  Counting.  The 7 candidates for council receiving, respectively,
the largest number of votes shall be declared elected.



§ 37.  Fluoridation.  Any ordinance, resolution, or other measure enacted
by the Council of Indian Hill which provides  for  or  authorizes  the 
fluoridation  of  water furnished to Indian Hill or its people or processed
and distributed by any water works which may now or hereafter be maintained
or operated by the Village of Indian Hill must first be approved by a
majority of the electors voting on the question at a general election before
said ordinance shall become effective, and any such ordinance, resolution or
measure providing for or authorizing such fluoridation that may have been
passed or enacted before this amendment is adopted shall cease to be
effective until approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question
at a general election.  (Amendment adopted by voters 11-6-73)



Schedule 1  Effect.  This Charter shall take effect and be in force from
and after adoption.



Schedule 2  Offices of members of council.  The offices of members of
council, mayor, clerk and treasurer as provided by statute are abolished by

mayor, elected by the electors of Indian Hill on November 4, 1941, shall upon
the adoption of this Charter have and exercise all the powers and perform all
the duties of members of council as prescribed in this Charter and shall
serve until their successors elected in 1943 shall take office, and such

enumerated in division (B) hereof, a charge in writing shall be filed with
the Clerk of the Mayor’s Court, an entry thereof made upon the journal and
an opportunity given to the accused to be heard, by himself or herself or
counsel. This division does not prevent the Mayor’s Court from issuing
process to bring the accused into court, or from holding him or her in
custody, pending such proceedings.



   (D)   Right of accused to bail. In proceeding under division (B)
hereof, if the writ is not returnable forthwith, the Mayor’s Court may fix

charge. On the execution of such bond, the accused shall be released from
custody.



   (E)   Trial. Upon the day fixed for the trial in a contempt
proceeding, the Mayor’s Court shall investigate the charge and hear any
answer or testimony which the accused makes or offers. The Mayor’s Court
shall then determine whether or not the accused is guilty of the contempt
charge.



   (F)   Imprisonment until order obeyed. When the contempt consists of
the omission to do an act which the accused yet can perform, he or she may be
imprisoned until he or she performs it.



   (G)   Judgment final. The judgment and order of the Mayor’s Court
or officer thereof made in cases on contempt may be reviewed on appeal.
Appeal proceedings shall not suspend execution of the order or judgment until
the person in contempt files a bond in the court rendering the judgment, or
in the court or before the officer making the order, payable to the Village
of Indian Hill with sureties to the acceptance of the Clerk of such court, in
an amount fixed by the Mayor thereof, conditioned that if judgment is
rendered against such person, he or she will abide by and perform the order
or judgment.



   (H)   Release of prisoner committed for contempt. When a person is
committed to jail for contempt the Mayor may discharge him or her from

§ 34.29  SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS.



   In the event the prognosis of any medical examination referred to in
§§ 34.25 through 34.28 suggests a member's inability to serve as a member
of the police department with full effectiveness, the member shall do
everything necessary to clear up the deficiencies by such means as may be
prescribed by competent medical advice.  Any such member may be required to

enable him to be an effective member of the department, the City Manager may

cooperate with the police relief and pension trustees of the village with
respect to limited duty or discharge of members who fail to have physical
condition and health sufficient to permit the member's full and effective
service as a member of the department.

section, indemnify any current or former elected or appointed officer,
employee or member of a board or commission of the village, whether or not
such person is compensated for such service, from liability incurred in the
performance  of his duties  by paying  any judgment in, or amount
negotiated in settlement of, any civil action arising under federal law, the
law of Ohio or the ordinances of the village.  The reasonableness of the
amount of any consent judgment or settlement shall be subject to the review
and approval of the Solicitor and the City Council. The foregoing
indemnification provisions shall include indemnification for the cost of
defense of any such action.  The foregoing shall apply to the

behalf of the village as Trustee of the Green Areas and Recreational Fund
trust.



   (B)   The village shall not indemnify a Council member, officer or
employee under any of the following circumstances:



      (1)   To the extent the Council member, officer or employee is
covered by a policy of insurance for civil liability purchased by the village;



      (2)   When the Council member, officer or employee acts
manifestly outside the scope of his employment or official responsibilities,
or with malicious purpose, or in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;



      (3)   For any portion of a judgment that represents punitive
or exemplary damages;



      (4)   For any portion of a consent judgment or settlement that
is unreasonable.



   (C)   The village may purchase a policy or policies of insurance on
behalf of officers and employees of the village providing coverage for
amounts in excess of $1,000,000 per occurrence incurred in connection with
any civil action, demand, or claim against the Council member, officer or
employee by reason of any act or omission by the Council member, officer or
employee occurring in the performance of his duties and not coming within the
terms of division (B)(2) of this section.

      (1)   Any defense that would otherwise be available in an
action alleging personal liability of a Council member, officer or employee;



      (2)   The operation of R.C. § 9.83.



   (E)   The indemnification of Council members, officers or employees
against judgments or settlements pursuant to this section shall be
accomplished only through the following procedure:



      (1)   If the village determines that the actions or omissions
of its Council member, officer or employee who is to be indemnified were not
within the terms of division (B)(2) of this section, an indemnity agreement
shall be prepared by the Solicitor, specifying that the village will
indemnify the Council member, officer or employee from a particular judgment
that has been rendered or a particular settlement amount that has been
negotiated.  The agreement shall name the person or entity to whom payment
by the village of the judgment or settlement amount will be made, and the
agreement shall not be effective until it is approved by the Council member,
officer or employee to be indemnified, the Solicitor and the City Council. 
The Solicitor shall approve the indemnity agreement unless he finds that
division (B) of this section prohibits the village from indemnifying the
Council member, officer or employee, or prohibits the village from
indemnifying the Council member, officer or employee for a portion of a
judgment or settlement and the indemnity agreement would indemnify the
Council member, officer or employee for all or part of that portion.



      (2)   If sufficient moneys have not been appropriated, the
City Council shall appropriate sufficient funds to pay the indemnification,
and no payment shall be made until the appropriation has been made.



   (F)   A Council member, officer or employee may commence an action
against the village in a court of competent jurisdiction to prove that he is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to division (A) of this section and that
division (B) of this section does not prohibit or limit his indemnification
and seeking either a judgment against the village for a sum of money that the
Council member, officer or employee has paid to satisfy a judgment or
settlement or an order directing the village to pay a judgment or settlement
against the Council member, officer or employee which has not been satisfied.



   (G)   An action brought pursuant to this section shall be commenced
no later than two years after the cause of action arising under this section
accrues.  A cause of action arising under this section accrues upon the
entry of a money judgment against the Council member, officer or employee if
the time for filing an appeal in the action lapses without the filing of an
appeal; upon the conclusion of the final appeal in any action in which a
money judgment is entered against the Council member, officer or employee if
an appeal is filed in the action; or upon execution of any settlement
agreement requiring payment of money by the Council member, officer or
employee.

authorized to construct water main extensions where practicable upon
application of the owners of 50% or more of the abutting foot frontage to be
served by the proposed extension, accompanied by payment per linear abutting
foot of property owned by the petitioners.  The original amount of payment
per linear foot and refund of any surplus shall be determined as in §
51.21.  When an extension has been constructed in accordance with this
section, water tap connections to such extension shall be permitted only to
serve premises for which the front foot charge has been paid at the time of
the filing of the petition, provided that the owners of other property
abutting the extension may be permitted to make a tap or connection upon
payment of a sum equal to the original amount per linear foot plus 15% per
linear abutting front foot of the premises owned by them.

§ 51.24  CONSTRUCTING WITHOUT PETITION.



   (A)   When council of the village determines by ordinance that it is
to the best interest of the water distribution system to construct a water
main extension connecting two or more existing mains, the superintendent of
water works shall be authorized to construct such an extension without the
filing of any petition therefor or the making of any advanced deposit. 
After the completion of any such extension, the superintendent shall cause
any premises abutting the streets or way in which the extension is laid to be
notified of the installation and that a tap may be made thereto upon payment
per linear foot to be determined as in § 51.21.



   (B)   No taps shall be permitted to be made in any extension until
and unless the payment herein shall be paid in full.  The above payment is
in addition to the normal charge for service branch installations indicated
in § 51.37.

§ 51.25  ASSESSMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW.



   The owners of property to be served by a proposed water main extension
may petition for the construction of the extension and the assessment of the
cost thereof in accordance with the provisions of state law.



   (A)   The size, materials, and all other specifications to be used
in the construction of any water main shall be determined by the
superintendent, in accordance with "Engineering and Plumbing Requirements" to
be promulgated by him and kept on file by him in his office.  The
requirements shall be kept up to date by the superintendent and shall be open
to public inspection at all times. Copies of the requirements may be
distributed by the superintendent as may be determined by him from time to
time.



   (B)   No water main extension shall be constructed on any new street
or any undedicated street unless the location of the street has been approved
by the village planning commission and until all the requirements of all
other ordinances, if any, have been complied with.



   (C)   No water main extension shall be laid in any unimproved street
whose profile is such that in case of the improvement of the street, it would
be necessary to relay the main to conform with the then established grade and
no water main shall be constructed under the provisions of § 51.23, where,
owing to the topography of the territory abutting the street, or to other
conditions, further property development is precluded or is unlikely.



   (D)   The superintendent shall maintain a record of all charges
outstanding against premises abutting streets improved with water main
extension in accordance with § 51.23 or § 51.24.  The record shall be
suitably indexed as to streets and part of streets, and shall at all times be
available for public inspection.  With the consent of the county auditor, a
duplicate copy of the record shall be kept on file in the office of the
county auditor for the convenience of title examiners and prospective
purchasers of real estate.  As the charges are paid or as new charges are
imposed, the necessary notation shall be made in that record by way of
amendment or supplement.  The notation by way of amendment or supplement
shall be copied into the county auditor's duplicate record at intervals of
not more than 30 days.  The record shall at all times be accompanied by a
statement from the superintendent indicating the date to which the record has
been carried.

§ 51.26  RETAIL SERVICE AREA AND SPECIAL BENEFIT DISTRICT SERVED BY CITY OF
CINCINNATI WATER WORKS.



   (A)   There is established a retail service area for the City of
Cincinnati Water Works inside the village described in the water agreement by
and between the City of Cincinnati and the City of the Village of Indian
Hill, dated December 21, 1984, as the area bounded on the west, north, and
east by the Indian Hill corporation line and on the south generally bounded
by the south line of Section Number 34 of Symmes Township, and the south line
of Section Number 4 of Sycamore Township.



   (B)   A portion of that service area, comprised of parcels listed in
the Appendix, is herewith defined as being the area benefited by the 12-inch
trunk water distribution main constructed in Hopewell Road and Montgomery
Road as shown on approved plan, Cincinnati Water Works Job No. 4- 1837, dated
January 16, 1985, at village expense in the public interest for supplying
water to that area in adequate quantities and pressures for domestic use and
fire suppression.



   (C)   The benefited properties are identified on the Appendix to
this chapter by a listing compiled from the Hamilton County Auditor's
property records, showing book, page, parcel number, and gross acreage.



   (D)   Provision is made for owners of those properties within that
benefited area to obtain water service from this 12-inch trunk water
distribution main by a direct tap/connection or indirectly by a system of
public water main extensions or loops with this distribution main.



   (E)   Owners or their agents desiring water service within the
benefited area shall make application for such service jointly to the
director of the Cincinnati Water Works and to the superintendent of Village
Water Works.  No service branch or service main shall be approved or
installed until the owner of the benefited property, as set forth in the
Appendix, shall have paid, in advance, to the village a tap-in fee,
calculated on the district rate/acre in effect at the time of application,
times the total number of acres being benefited or having the potential for
being benefited as a result of the service line applied for.



      (1)   Tap-in fees for water main extensions intended to serve
a subdivision shall be calculated on the basis of gross acreage of the entire
subdivision receiving benefit.



      (2)   Tap-in fees for water service branches serving a single
residential dwelling, not part of a subdivision, shall be calculated on the
gross acreage of the parcel on which the dwelling is being constructed and
receiving benefit.



      (3)   The tap-in fees shall be paid in addition to any other
established permit fee or construction charges incurred for the installation
of water main extensions or service branches.



      (4)   In the event that a large parcel, for which the tap-in
fee has been paid, is later subdivided further, no additional tap-in fees
will be applied for service branches required to serve the additional
dwellings on the same tract of land; however, normal fees and costs for the
service branch installation will be charged.



      (5)   The Superintendent of Village Water Works shall maintain
accurate records of the parcels subject to paying tap-in fees and shall
establish and administer the procedure for collecting those fees.  The
initial tap-in fee shall be calculated on the basis of total project cost,
including engineering, inspection, construction, interest charge, if any, and
total acres being benefited.  Fees shall be adjusted no less than at least
once every five calendar years to reflect an interest charge being paid on
bond anticipation notes or other securities being used to finance the water
main to serve this district, commencing at the date of completion of
construction and placing in service of said water main.  He shall arrange
for the Appendix to be updated and amended as necessary to indicate payment
of tap-in fees for individual parcels and to record any boundary line changes
which might occur as a result of replatting.



   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no
tap/connection shall be made to the new 12-inch trunk water line serving the
benefited area, as created in the Appendix, to serve any portion of a
subdivision located in the benefited area, which subdivision's plat was
approved prior to the effective date of this section, in anticipation of an
adequate water supply being available by the construction of the 12-inch
trunk water line, without



there first having been paid a tap-in fee, calculated in the manner set forth
in this section.

the Department but shall be paid for by the property owner at the time of the
application for water service, the payment to be as established by ordinance.
Except in cases where service branches are installed for vacant property in
connection with highway improvements, applications for service branch
installations shall be accompanied by application for meters which shall also
be paid for at the time of the application.



      (1)   Only metered water service branches shall be permitted.



      (2)   Branches installed for fire protection shall be subject
to "Engineering and Plumbing Requirements" provided that a branch for any

application has been duly filed at the village office.



      (4)   No application for water service will be allowed or no
water shall be supplied to any applicant or consumer where the applicant or
consumer is indebted to the Department for water supplied, work done,
materials furnished or penalties imposed. This section will apply whether the
indebtedness was incurred at the premises for which application is made or at
any other premises supplied by the Department within or without the village
limits.



   (B)   No permit for the erection of a building shall be approved by
the City Manager unless an application for a service branch has been made, or
an application for meter has been made in cases where the service branch has

so set that water can flow into and not out of the premises and each service
branch shall be equipped with a separate meter.



   (E)   Water service branches shall be the property of the owners of
the property served by them and that portion of the service branch from the
curb cock into the premises served shall be maintained in proper condition by
the owners. Failure to repair a leak or leaks when notified of same within
the time allowed on the notice shall be sufficient cause to justify the
Department in discontinuing water service.



   (F)   No connection into more than one building shall be made from
one tap unless the Superintendent has given his or her approval in writing.



   (G)   No attachment shall be made to any service branch or to any
pipe or other fixture which has been shut off pursuant to this operating code
or order of the Superintendent without first having obtained a permit upon
application duly made, nor shall water be taken from any service branch which
is or has been out of use without such a permit.



   (H)   The original purchase of a meter shall be made by the consumer
but after it has been installed and placed in service, the Department will
assume the maintenance of the meter or its replacement without charge to the
consumer, except that in cases of damage by freezing, hot water, or other
neglect on the part of the consumer, the cost of repairs or replacement shall
be charged to the consumer.



   (I)   Meters shall be fully and substantially set in a workmanlike
manner and in accordance with the "Engineering and Plumbing Requirements".
Meters hereafter installed shall be placed in a frost-proof meter box or pit,
plans for which may be obtained from the Department, and shall be placed at
the front lot line.



   (J)   The Superintendent and authorized employees of the Department
shall have the right at reasonable times to enter any premises where a meter
is installed for the purpose of reading, examining, inspecting, or testing
the same. The Superintendent shall be authorized to fix reasonable charges
for the removal, examination, inspection, testing, and reinstating meters
upon application of the consumer.



   (K)   Meter and service branch charges as set forth in the Appendix
following this chapter, are hereby adopted and shall be effective January 1,
2018. System customers who increase the size of their meter and service
branches shall be responsible for paying a fee equal to the difference in
cost between their present service size and the increase service size as set
forth in the Appendix.



   (L)   There are hereby established Capital Improvement Debt Service
Fees for the purpose of paying a portion of the cost of capital improvements
to the Water Works System and the costs associated with the financing of said
improvements. Said fees shall be in addition to meter and service branch fees

PAYMENT OF BILLS



§ 51.65  TIME OF PAYMENT.



   Water bills shall ordinarily be payable at intervals of 3 months, but
the Superintendent shall be authorized to provide, in special cases or in
certain classes of accounts, for payment at shorter intervals.  Water bills
shall be paid on or before the date stated on the bill.  The Superintendent
may grant an extension of time for payment, not to exceed 365 days with
interest based upon current interest rates, from the due date, without
penalty, in cases of indigency, relief, and similar conditions, after
investigation.  Partial payments may be accepted, but bills must be paid in
full before the expiration of the approved extension period.



('80 Code, § 52.30) (Am. Ord. 9-96, passed 4-22-96)



§ 51.66  PENALTY FOR NONPAYMENT.



   (A)   Where a water bill has not been paid by the date stated on the
regular bill a collection charge in the amount of 10% of the unpaid balance
will be assessed.  If the bill has not been paid by the date stated on the
delinquent notice, or the date to which the payment has been extended, a
shut-off bill shall be prepared.  A charge of $25 shall be applied to all
accounts scheduled for shut-off.  As soon thereafter as practical, the
shut-off bill shall be presented at the premises and if the same is not paid,
the water shall be shut off immediately, and it shall not, thereafter be
turned on again until all charges due and payable, including advance charges,
if any, are fully paid.  This section shall apply whether or not there has
been in the meantime a change of ownership or possession of the premises
supplied.  A charge of $20 shall be applied to all accounts where checks
received for payment are drawn on accounts with insufficient funds available.



   (B)   The village shall disconnect utility service in accord with
the following policies:



      (1)   When it becomes necessary for the village to discontinue
utility service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be
reinstated only after all bills for service then due have been paid and any
deposit required has been made.  It is the policy of the village to
discontinue utility service to customers by reason of nonpayment of bills
only after notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard on disputed bills.
The village's form for application for utility service and all bills shall
contain, in addition to the title, address, room number, and telephone number
of the official in charge of billing, clearly visible and easily readable
provisions to the effect:



         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before
the date set forth on the bill; and



         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that
date, a second bill will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the
bill is not paid within ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service
will be discontinued for nonpayment; and



         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his
bill shall have a right to a hearing at which time he may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his choosing and may present
orally or in writing his complaint and contentions to the village official in
charge of utility billing.  This official shall be authorized to order that
the customer's service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to
make a final determination of the customer's complaint.



      (2)   With the exception of approved extensions as specified
in § 51.65, requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be
entertained; only questions of proper and correct billing will be
considered.  In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the
hearing procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time
specified.

§ 51.67  ASSESSING CHARGES.



   The Superintendent shall assess and collect proper charges for water,
materials supplied, and work done.  Any owner of real estate premises
installing or maintaining water service connections shall be considered as
accepting the provisions of all lawful rules and regulations of the
department, and as agreeing, in particular, to be liable for all water and

carried in the name of the owner or in the name of tenants or other persons. 



('80 Code, § 52.32) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49)



§ 51.68  LEAKAGES.



   No reduction in water charges shall be made for leakage except in cases
where it shall appear, on investigation, that the leakage is underground and
not subject to detection by ordinary methods, and where, further, the owner
and other occupants of the premises are free from negligence in causing or
failing to report the leakage; excepting, also, in cases during periods of
emergency, when, by reason of shortage in materials or manpower, immediate
repairs are not available, where the owner has made diligent efforts to
provide the repairs and has actually employed a plumber to make them, in
which cases an allowance of time of not to exceed 30 days may be granted to
permit the plumber to complete the repairs.  No reduction for leakage shall
be permitted in an amount in excess of 50% of the water bill as rendered.
('80 Code, § 52.33) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49)

§ 51.70  BILLS.



   Bills for water supplied, work done or material furnished will be
delivered at the premises or where directed, as a matter of convenience to
the owners of property or their agents.  Failure to receive bills will not
relieve from responsibility for prompt payment.  Duplicate bills may be
obtained upon application. 



('80 Code, § 52.35) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49)

§ 51.72  CHARGES PAYABLE FORTHWITH.



   Charges for work done or material furnished, contract bills on main
extensions, improvement charges, main pipe extension charges and final water
bills, shall be payable forthwith.



('80 Code, § 52.37) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49)



§ 51.73  DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.



   Accounts unpaid on the date indicated on the bill shall be considered
as delinquent, and a notice of delinquency shall thereupon be mailed.  If
the account is unpaid on the date shown on the delinquent notice, it shall be
placed in the hands of a turnkey for collection.  When the turnkey cannot
make collection, the water shall be shut off. If a delinquent account remains
unpaid the city reserves the right under the law, to certify same to the
Hamilton County Auditor by a certificate signed by the Finance Director. The
County Auditor shall then place the amount certified by signed certificate on
the appropriate tax duplicate with interest and penalties allowed by law,
including the applicable assessment fee. The same shall be collected as all
other taxes and shall be considered as a lien upon the real property.



('80 Code, § 52.38) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49; Am. Ord. 18-17, passed
12-18-17)



§ 51.74  RESTORATION OF SERVICE.



   If a bill is paid after the water has been shut off, service will not
be restored until the following day.  In addition to charges shown on the
water bill, every delinquent account shall be subject to an additional charge
of $25 for service, whether the turnkey calls for collection or not.



('80 Code, § 52.39) (Ord. 9-96, passed 4-22-96)



§ 51.99  PENALTY.



   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall, in
addition to other penalties provided by law, be fined not less than $25 nor
more than $5,000 or be imprisoned not exceeding 30 days, or both.

§ 52.001  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   The village is vitally concerned with the use of all
rights-of-way in the village as such rights- of-way are a valuable and
limited resource which must be utilized to promote the public health, safety,
and welfare including the economic development of the village.



   (B)   Changes in the public utilities and communication industries
have increased the demand and need for access to rights-of-way and placement
of facilities and structures therein.



   (C)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to,
and structures and facilities in, the rights-of-way to promote efficiency,
discourage uneconomic duplication of facilities, lessen the public
inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the rights-of-way, and promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.



   (D)   The village has authority under the Laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4,
and 7, to regulate public and private entities which use the rights-of-way.

§ 52.024  SYSTEMS IN PLACE WITHOUT A CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.

or part of a system found in a rights-of-way for which a certificate of
registration has not been obtained, unless specifically exempted by R.C. §
4939.02(D) shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the

(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)

(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



   DISCONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS, ABANDONED AND UNUSED FACILITIES



§ 52.035  DISCONTINUANCE REQUIREMENTS.



   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing operation of any
system in the village shall:



   (A)   Provide information satisfactory to the village that the
provider's obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this chapter
and any other chapters in the Codified Ordinances or other laws have been
lawfully assumed by another applicant and/or provider;



   (B)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner
that promotes the village's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights-of-way
capacity. Said proposal must be approved by the Public Works Superintendent;



   (C)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in
place indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of
solution. Said proposal must be approved by the Public Works Superintendent;



   (D)   Completely remove its entire system within a reasonable amount
of time and in a manner acceptable to the village; or



   (E)   Submit to the village, in good faith and within a reasonable
amount of time, and in accordance with R.C. §§ 4905.20 and 4905.21, a
proposal for transferring ownership of its facilities to the village. If a
provider proceeds under this clause, the village may, at its option:



      (1)   Purchase the facilities; or



      (2)   Unless a valid removal bond has already been provided
pursuant to § 52.211, require the provider to post a bond in an amount
sufficient to reimburse the village for its reasonably anticipated costs to
be incurred in removing the facilities.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.036  ABANDONED FACILITIES.



   Facilities of a provider who fails to comply with this section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The village may exercise any remedies
or rights it has by law or in equity, including, but not limited to: abating
the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to the finding of the PUCO pursuant to the
requirements of R.C. §§ 4905.20 and 4905.21; or requiring removal of the
facilities by the provider or by the provider's surety. If the village
determines to require a provider to remove unused facilities in any
rights-of-way, the village shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this
removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavation of the
rights-of-way. If the village abates the nuisance it may take all action
necessary to recover its costs to abate said nuisance, including but not
limited to, those methods set forth in R.C. § 715.261.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



   CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION



§ 52.045  NATURE OF ISSUANCE.



   A certificate of registration shall not convey equitable or legal title
in the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the village for the limited purposes
and for the limited period stated in the certificate of registration and in
accordance with this chapter and all laws including any rules and regulations
adopted by the Public Works Superintendent. The rights to locate facilities
and/or a system in and the rights to occupy the right-of-way itself may not
be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, provider may sublease capacity
(or other nonmaterial facility aspects) and two or more providers may
collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each
such provider complies with the provisions of this chapter. Collocating
providers may file a joint application for a construction permit. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its
facilities on facilities of others, including the village's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with
any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.046  OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.



   In addition to a certificate of registration, providers shall obtain
any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses
necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
federal, state and local authorities and upon the village's reasonable
request, shall provide copies of such documents to the village. Further, a
certificate of registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall not entitle
a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the facilities,
easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any
other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the management
or control of the village.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.047  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION APPLICATIONS.



   To obtain a certificate of registration to construct, own, or maintain
any system within the village an application must be filed with the village
on the form adopted by the Department of Public Works which is hereby
incorporated by reference. All applications shall be accompanied by a
non-refundable $2,000 application fee which will pay for internal processing
and administrative costs associated with the application process.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)

paying a greater amount of compensation as required under § 52.070, then the

examine, or audit during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to
a provider under the circumstances, all documents, records, or other

(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



   CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION



§ 52.165  TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUIRED.



   Prior to commencement of any initial construction of facilities in the
rights-of-way a construction permittee, upon the reasonable request of the
Public Works Superintendent, shall provide technical information about the
proposed route of construction. The technical information required may
consist of completion of the following tasks:



   (A)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other
location data indicating the existence and approximate location of all
facilities along the proposed construction route.



   (B)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.



   (C)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate
horizontal and vertical location of all underground facilities the applicant
or person on whose behalf the permit was applied for owns or controls in the
rights-of-way along the proposed system route. Upon the reasonable request of
the Public Works Superintendent, a permittee shall also record and identify
the general location of all other facilities in the rights-of-way along the
proposed system route. For the purposes of this section, general location
shall mean the alignment of other facilities in the rights-of-way, but shall
not necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the rights-of-way.



   (D)   If a provider records the information requested above in an
electronic format, the provider shall provide the village with an electronic
copy of the data obtained from completion of the tasks described in this
section. Incorporation of the data required herein by electronic means shall
include only data for new facilities that can be readily incorporated into
the village's database.



   (E)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
construction permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate
the apparent conflict. A construction permittee shall not excavate more than
a three foot by three foot square hole in the rights-of-way to complete this
task.



   (F)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the
tasks described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid
the need to relocate other underground facilities.



   (G)   All confidential/proprietary information submitted herein
shall be so labeled.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)

   All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to §§ 52.165
through 52.179 shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility
engineering or may be performed by the construction permittee if the
construction permittee is qualified to complete the project itself.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.167  COST OF STUDY.



   The construction permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with §§
52.165 through 52.167 of this chapter.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.168  CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE.



   Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, or unless the Public
Works Superintendent waives any of the requirements of this section due to
unique or unusual circumstances, a construction permittee shall be required
to: submit a written construction schedule to the village ten working days
before commencing any work in or about the rights-of-way and, shall further
notify the village not less than two working days in advance of any
excavation in the rights-of-way. This section shall apply to all situations
with the exception of circumstances under § 52.203.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.169  LOCATION OF FACILITIES.



   (A)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old
facilities, either above ground or underground, shall be completed in
conformity with applicable laws.



   (B)   The village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the
placement of new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the
right-of-way is full. In making such decisions, the village shall strive to
the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the
rights-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public
health, safety, and welfare, the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of
year, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future
village and county plans for public improvements, development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest, and the nondiscriminatory
and competitively neutral treatment of providers.



   (C)   Upon the concurrence of the village, or if it is determined by
the construction permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal
agency (or other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing
poles in the rights-of-way are full, then those poles may be replaced with
bigger and/or taller poles in order to accommodate additional facilities or
systems only after the construction permittee has made reasonable attempts to
reach an acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller
poles. This division shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s)
with identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or
hazardous condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new facilities or
additional facilities are attached.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.170  LEAST DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY.



   All construction or maintenance of facilities shall be accomplished in
the manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the
rights-of-way. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed in
the subsurface rights-of-way under this chapter may be required to be
installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable
may be installed under this chapter using "direct bury" techniques.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.171  RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.



   (A)   A provider shall, at its own expense, permanently remove and
relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the village finds it
necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the
village requests removal and/or relocation, the village shall waive all
applicable construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the
provider shall restore the rights-of-way to a condition at least as good as
its condition immediately prior to said removal or relocation. If existing
poles are required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles
will be replaced with reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size
unless otherwise permitted by the village. The Public Works Superintendent
may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable
interference by the provider's facilities with:



      (1)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the
village or county;



      (2)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it,
or when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the rights-of-way.



   (B)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities
in the right-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required
for the purposes of the village, shall have a permanent easement in such
vacated portion or excess portion in conformity with R.C. § 723.04.



   (C)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the village, a provider
fails to commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as
designated by the village, within 30 days after the village's removal order
is served upon provider, or if a provider fails to substantially complete
such removal, including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the
village, within 12 months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent
with applicable law, the village shall have the right to:



      (1)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the
facilities belong to the village with all rights of ownership, including, but
not limited to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a
transfer of all right, title and interest in the facilities to another person
for operation;



      (2)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the
provider in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the village at provider's
cost and expense, by another person, however, the village shall have no
liability for any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be
liable to the village for all reasonable costs incurred by the village in
such action; and



      (3)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any
portion of the provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way
of the village designated by the village for removal and not timely removed
by the provider shall belong to and become the property of the village
without payment to the provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver
such documents, as the village shall request, in form and substance
acceptable to the village, to evidence such ownership by the village.

§ 52.172  PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.



   Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each provider
who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be responsible
to mark the horizontal and make every reasonable attempt using best efforts,
to mark the approximate vertical placement of all its facilities. All
providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an
effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best
procedure for excavation.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.173  RIGHTS-OF-WAY RESTORATION.



   (A)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of
the rights-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates
specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must
restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards
established by the Public Works Superintendent, subject to any applicable
laws. The permittee must also inspect the area of the work and use reasonable
care to maintain the same condition for 12 months thereafter.



   (B)   In approving an application for a permit, the village may
choose either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or the village
may restore the rights-of-way itself at the expense of the permittee.



   (C)   If the village chooses to allow permittee to restore the
rights-of-way, construction permittee shall at the time of application of a
construction permit post a construction bond in an amount determined by the
village to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to
a condition at least as good as its condition immediately prior to
construction. If, 12 months after completion of the restoration of the
rights-of-way, the village determines that the rights-of-way have been
properly restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be released.



   (D)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the
standards and with the materials specified and approved by the village.



   (E)   By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee
guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its
completion. During this 12 month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Public Works, correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Works.
Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five calendar days of
the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Works.



   (F)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights- of-way in the
manner and to the condition required by the village, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the village, the
village, at its option, with notice to the provider and a reasonable time to
cure, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the
village, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the rights-of-way
and any other costs incurred by the village. Upon failure to pay, the village
may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/or pursue
any and all legal and equitable remedies.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.174  DAMAGE TO PROVIDER'S FACILITIES AND TO OTHER FACILITIES.



   (A)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the village
performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain,
support, or move a provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the
costs associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the village may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay
or the village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee
and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.



   (B)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing
any facilities in the rights-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the village's response to an
emergency caused by such provider's facilities.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)

(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.178  OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

produced within 12 business hours.



   (D)   A minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Director of the Department of Public
Works.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)

§ 52.192  ISSUANCE OF MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMITS; CONDITIONS.



   (A)   If the Public Works Superintendent determines that the

maintenance permit process, the Public Works Superintendent shall issue a
minor maintenance permit subject to the provisions of this chapter.



   (B)   The village may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to
the rules and regulations enacted by the Public Works Superintendent, upon
the issuance of the minor maintenance permit and the performance of the minor
maintenance permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way,
to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of- way, and
to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.193  MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMIT FEES.



   The Public Works Superintendent shall, after providing notice to and
seeking input from all providers with systems in the village right-of-way,
develop and maintain a schedule of permit fees in an amount sufficient to
recoup all reasonable costs associated with processing minor maintenance
permits, as allowed by law. No minor maintenance permit shall be issued
without payment of minor maintenance permit fees except to the village or
county, which shall be exempt. Minor maintenance permit fees that were paid
for a minor maintenance permit that the village has revoked due to breach are
not refundable. The Public Works Superintendent may revoke the minor
maintenance permit as any other permit may be revoked under this chapter.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



   ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION



§ 52.200  MANDATORY DENIAL OF PERMIT.



   Except in the case of an emergency, no construction permit will be
granted:



   (A)   To any person who has not yet made an application;



   (B)   To any person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to
the village;



   (C)   To any person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds
for the revocation of a permit; or



   (D)   If, in the discretion of the Public Works Superintendent, the
issuance of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a
conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other
event. The Public Works Superintendent, in exercising this discretion, shall
be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over
the rights-of-way, and by considerations relating to the public health,
safety, and welfare.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.201  PERMISSIVE DENIAL.



   The Public Works Superintendent may deny a permit in order to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights- of-way, or when
necessary to protect the rights-of- way and its users. The Public Works
Superintendent, in his or her discretion, may consider one or more of the
following factors: the extent to which rights-of-way space where the permit
is sought is available; the competing demands for the particular space in the
rights-of- way; the availability of other locations in the rights- of-way or
in other rights-of-way for the proposed facilities; the applicability of this
chapter or other regulations of the rights-of-way that affect location of
facilities in the rights-of-way; the degree of compliance of the provider
with the terms and conditions of this chapter and its requirements, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to
surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that
part of the rights-of-way; the condition and age of the rights-of-way, and
whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the
balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the
rights-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the
expansion into additional parts of the rights-of-way; and whether such
applicant or their agent has failed within the past 3 years to comply, or is
presently not in full compliance, with the requirements of this chapter or,
if applicable, any other chapters of the Codified Ordinances, or any other
applicable law.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.202  DISCRETIONARY ISSUANCE.



   (A)   Notwithstanding the provisions of § 52.200, the Public Works
Superintendent may issue a permit in any case where the permit is necessary;



      (1)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer
of the permit applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to
the village;



      (2)   To allow such customer to materially improve its
service; or



      (3)   To allow a new economic development project.



   (B)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit
applicant must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for

§ 52.203  WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.



   (A)   Emergency situations.



      (1)   Each provider shall, as soon as reasonably practicable,
notify the Public Works Superintendent of any event regarding its facilities
which it considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take
whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within
two business days, unless otherwise extended by the Public Works
Superintendent, after the occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever
is later), the provider shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith and fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring
itself into compliance with this chapter for any and all actions taken in
response to the emergency.



      (2)   In the event that the village becomes aware of an
emergency regarding a provider's facilities, the village may attempt to
contact the provider or system representative of each provider affected, or
potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the village may take
whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the
cost of which shall be borne by the provider whose facilities caused the
emergency.



   (B)   Non-emergency situations.  Except in the case of an
emergency, any provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or
through a right-of-way without a valid permit shall cease any further work
upon the order of the inspector or Public Works Superintendent and before
commencing any additional work shall within ten business days of initiating
such construction obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said permit,
pay double all the other fees required by the Codified Ordinances, deposit
with the village the fees necessary to correct any damage to the rights-
of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.204  REVOCATION OF PERMITS.



   (A)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the Codified
Ordinances as a privilege and not as a right. The village reserves the right,
as provided herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the
event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any
provision or condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall
include, but shall not be limited to, the following:



      (1)   The violation of any provision or condition of the
permit;



      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or
condition of the permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any
fraud or deceit upon the village or its citizens;



      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the
application for a permit;



      (4)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required
construction or removal bonds and/or insurance;



      (5)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration;



      (6)   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner;
or



      (7)   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered
pursuant to § 52.168.



   (B)   If the Public Works Superintendent determines that the
permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any
law or any provision or condition of the permit, the Public Works
Superintendent shall serve a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such
violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for
revocation of the permit. Upon a substantial breach, as stated above, the
Public Works Superintendent may place additional or revised conditions on the
permit.



   (C)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Public Works
Superintendent with a plan, acceptable to the Public Works Superintendent,
for its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Public Works
Superintendent, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the permit.



   (D)   From time to time, the Public Works Superintendent may
establish a list of standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach
of any condition shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public
rights-of-way as defined in § 52.120.



   (E)   If a permittee commits a second substantial breach as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed
further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.



   (F)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the
village for the village's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and
the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection
with such revocation.

Works Superintendent, in a form acceptable to the Director of Law, an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in an amount
determined by the Public Works Superintendent to be appropriate, based upon
fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction default, problem, or
deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general
public, the Public Works Superintendent shall serve the construction
permittee with notice detailing any construction default, problem, or
deficiency. If the Public Works Superintendent determines that correction or
repair of the construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or
has not been substantially initiated within ten calendar days after the date
following service of notification and detailing the construction default,
problem or deficiency, then the village may attach the letter of credit or
surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the

   Upon issuance of a certificate of registration, and continuously
thereafter until 120 days after a provider's facilities have been removed
from the rights-of-way, (unless the Public Works Superintendent notifies the
provider that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider shall
deposit with the Public Works Superintendent and maintain, in a form
acceptable to the Director of Law, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of
credit or a surety bond in an amount equal to or greater than $50,000. The
Public Works Superintendent shall make all reasonable efforts to allow
provider a period of five business days after serving notification to correct
or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to Public Works
Superintendent's attachment of letter of credit or surety bond regarding the
removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to
the provider by the Public Works Superintendent.

bond required by § 52.211, provider may deposit with the Public Works
Superintendent, in a form acceptable to the Director of Law, an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of
$5,000,000. Unless a construction default, problem or deficiency involves an
emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Public Works
Superintendent shall make all reasonable efforts to allow permittee a period
of five business days after sending notification in writing to the last known
business address to correct or repair any construction default, problem or
deficiency prior to Public Works Superintendent's attachment of letter of
credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to
the provider by the Public Works Superintendent.



(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.213  SELF BONDING.



   In lieu of the construction bond required by § 52.210, the removal
bond required by § 52.211 and the blanket bond required by § 52.212, those
providers maintaining a book value in excess of $20,000,000 may submit a
statement to the Public Works Superintendent requesting to self-bond. If
approval to self-bond is granted, a provider shall assure the village that
such self-bonding shall provide the village with no less protection and
security than would have been afforded to the village by a third party surety
providing provider with the types and amounts bonds detailed in the above
named sections. This statement shall include:



   (A)   Audited financial statements for the previous year;



   (B)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program; and,



   (C)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably
requested by the Public Works Superintendent.

§ 52.214  PURPOSES.



   The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to the extent
it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:



   (A)   The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all
terms, conditions and obligations of this chapter;



   (B)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village
occasioned by the permittee or provider's violation of this chapter or its
failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other
directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter;



   (C)   The payment of all compensation due to the village, including
permit fees;

   The bond documents required by this section, and any replacement bond
documents shall, contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood
and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the surety
nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety until
ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least ninety (90) days written notice to City of surety's

   INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY



§ 52.225  VILLAGE DOES NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY.



   By reason of the acceptance of an application or the grant of a permit,
the village does not assume any liability:



   (A)   For injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of
service claims; or



   (B)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the

(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02)



§ 52.226  INDEMNIFICATION.



   By applying for and being issued a certificate of registration with the
village a provider agrees, or by accepting a permit a permittee is required
and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the village's agents,
elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from
all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out
of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair,
replacement, restoration, or operation of its facilities, or out of any
activity undertaken in or near a rights-of-way, whether any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a permit. A provider
or permittee further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought,
any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other
relief against the village's agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of
the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or
any activity undertaken in or near a rights-of-way, whether the act or
omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This
section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity
otherwise available to the provider, permittee, or to the village; and the
provider or permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the village, if
allowable by law, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or
immunity that the village could assert in its own behalf. Any and all
exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the
following:



   (A)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and
permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the village, its agents, elected officials, officers,
employees, volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all
lawsuits, claims (including without limitation worker's compensation claims
against the village or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and
judgments for injury or damages including but not limited to expenses for
reasonable legal fees and disbursements assumed by the village in connection
therewith:



      (1)   To persons or property, to the extent arising out of or
through the acts or omissions of provider, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the
rights-of-way, to which permittee's or provider's negligence shall in any way
contribute.



      (2)   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of
privacy, for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or
infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent
or any other right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider or
permittee, but excluding claims arising out of or related to village
programming.



      (3)   Arising out of provider's or permittee's failure to
comply with the provisions of any law applicable to provider or permittee in
its business hereunder.



   (B)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the village:



      (1)   Giving provider or permittee reasonable notice of any
claim or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which
indemnification is sought;



      (2)   Affording the provider or permittee the opportunity to
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and



      (3)   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making
available to the provider or permittee all pertinent information under the
village's control.



   (C)   The village shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and
defense thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees
and expense of such separate counsel if employed.

circumstances warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways
intersecting through highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the

traffic-control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting
streets or highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street
or highway, or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the
physical terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or
highway at which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to
stop or yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in
residence districts, the municipality may by ordinance designate such street
or highway, or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter
the affected residence district shall be indicated by official
traffic-control devices. Where two or more through highways designated under
this division intersect and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop
signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the
Department or by local authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise
provided in this section.

permit traffic to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.
Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of
a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through highway.

jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a

currently applicable. Use of this signal indication shall be limited to
supplementing stop, do not enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications
where compliance with the supplemented traffic control device requires a stop
at a designated point.



   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their
nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

to the holder of a probationary driver’s license who is doing either of the
following:



            1.   Traveling to or from work between the hours

at no cost a form to serve as the written documentation described in division

accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian, or
custodian.



   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of division
(C)(1)(a) or (C)(1)(b) of this section if, at the time of the violation, an
emergency existed that required the holder of the probationary driver’s

to, is convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed
a moving violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on
which the person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court
with jurisdiction over the violation may order that the holder must be
accompanied by the holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is
operating a motor vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property
used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period
not to exceed six months or the date the holder attains the age of 17 years,

manufacturer, and each occupant of the vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.

no law enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being
operated on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole
purpose of determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining

a noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows
the name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with
a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence
as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension
at the time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.



      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is
guilty of driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in
division (B)(3)(a) or division (B)(3)(b) of this section.



         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B)(3)(b)
of this section, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender
shall be sentenced pursuant to § 130.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28,
except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail term; the offender
shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding § 130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C.
§ 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to $1,000; and,
notwithstanding § 130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender
may be ordered pursuant to § 130.99 (F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a
term of community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to
complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as
indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the
underlying case.



         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the
offender previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more
violations of division (B)(1) of this section, or any combination of two or
more violations of division (B)(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111
or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, and the offender shall provide the court
with proof of financial responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the
offender fails to provide that proof of financial responsibility, then in
addition to any other penalties provided by law, the court may order
restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for
any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct
and proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before,
during, or after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced
under this section.



(R.C. § 4510.111)



   (C)   Repeat traffic offender; point system suspension. Any person
whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender under R.C. §
4510.037 and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle upon any
public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.



(R.C. § 4510.037(J))



   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under
this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a
valid permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation
of a restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other
person was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.



(R.C. § 4510.04)



§ 71.13  OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.



   (A)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C.
§§ 4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a
public road or highway or any public or private property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the
person has a valid driver's license issued under R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.



      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C.
§§ 4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a
public road or highway or any public or private property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the
person has a valid license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon
application by the registrar of motor vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The
license shall be in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the
registrar, upon a driver's or commercial driver's license, if the person has
a valid license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in
the form of a restricted license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the
person does not have a valid license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial
motor vehicle.



   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows
the name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with
a violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged
violation of division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a
motorcycle operator either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or a restricted license at the time of the
alleged violation of division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with
a violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.



   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as
follows:



      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has
held a valid driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state
or any other jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a
motorcycle by the offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as
a motorcycle operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license,
except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified
misdemeanor. When the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender
shall be sentenced pursuant to § 130.99 or R.C. §§2929.21 to 2929.28,
except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail term; the offender
shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding § 130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C.

may be ordered pursuant to § 130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a
term of community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to
complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as
indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the
underlying case. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to any violation of this section or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.



      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by
the offender, the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license
bearing the motorcycle endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was
expired at the time of the offense, except as otherwise provided in this
division, the offense is a minor misdemeanor. If within three years of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
two or more violations of this section or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.



   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first
violation of this section or if more than three years have passed since the
offender's last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.



   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (B)(2) of this
section, if within three years of the offense the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12,
this section, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the
past three years, and if the offender's license was expired for more than six
months at the time of the offense, the court shall impose a class seven
suspension of the offender's driver license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7).

and impoundment shall be issued and enforced in accordance with R.C. §
4503.233.



      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this

misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all
of the following:



         (a)   A mandatory jail term of 10 consecutive days.
Notwithstanding the jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, the
court may sentence the offender to a longer jail term of not more than one
year. The 10-day mandatory jail term shall be imposed unless, subject to
division (C) of this section, the court instead imposes a sentence of not
less than 90 consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring. The
period of house arrest with electronic monitoring shall not exceed one year;



         (b)   Notwithstanding the fines provided for in R.C.

         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this
section;

Notwithstanding the jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, the

shall be issued and enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to
a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under
this division is assigned or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (3)
applies, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealers association.
The proceeds from any fine so imposed shall be distributed in accordance with
division R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).



   (C)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of
house arrest with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section unless, within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a
written finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the
jail where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the
offender will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period
following the date of sentencing.



      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of
house arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release

guilty to a violation of this section a class seven suspension of the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7). 



      (1)   When permitted as specified in R.C. § 4510.021, if the
court grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under
this section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition
that the offender must display restricted license plates, issued under R.C.
§ 4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as
provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).



      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this

holding a commercial driver's license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a

suspension.



   (F)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any
other penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to
§ 130.99(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during,

pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised Code.



(R.C. § 4510.14)



   (H)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under
this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a
valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person
was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
either a financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged

§ 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.



      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of

other person was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.



      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought
under this section that the order of suspension resulted from the failure of
the alleged offender to respond to a financial responsibility random
verification request under R.C. § 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of
the initial financial responsibility random verification request, the alleged

section. The person charged with a violation of division (A) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.

notwithstanding § 130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender
may be ordered pursuant to § 130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a
term of community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to
complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as
indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the
underlying case.



      (2)   If, within three years of a violation of division (A) of
this section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or been convicted
of two or more violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.21 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree.



      (3)   In all cases, the court may impose upon the offender a

(R.C. § 4510.21)



   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under
this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a
valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person
was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding
in the same direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing
such movements;



      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive

yield the right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon
the unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute
an immediate hazard;



      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more
marked lanes for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;



      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with

the prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under
the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then
available for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster
vehicles if such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the
following circumstances:



         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction;



         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;

   (A)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the
roadway in overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction,
unless the left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a
sufficient distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be
completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic

in both directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for
a left turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway
nearest the center line thereof and by passing to the right of the center
line where it enters the intersection, and, after entering the intersection,
the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of
the center line of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left
turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the
center of the intersection.



      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one
direction on one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending

extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction
of travel of the vehicle, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn
shall be made so as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in
the left hand lane of the roadway being entered lawfully available to traffic
moving in that lane.

section or the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a
passenger of an automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in
violation of division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used
by the trier of fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or
contributory negligence. But, the trier of fact may determine based on
evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure
contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may diminish a
recovery of compensatory damages that represents non-economic loss, as
defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action that could have been recovered
but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements of a
properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure shall
not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other than a
prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible as
evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

equipped with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car
who sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then,
consistent with the Rules of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not
wearing the available occupant restraining device, was not wearing all of the
available elements of such a device, or was not wearing such a device as
properly adjusted is admissible in evidence in relation to any claim for
relief in a tort action to the extent that the claim for relief satisfies all
of the following:



         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to
the occupant;



         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer,
designer, distributor, or seller of the passenger car;



         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in

passenger car was not crashworthy.

in R.C. § 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered
with any other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or
innocence of the defendant.



         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of
division (A) or (B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is
vehicle-related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily substance at the time of the
alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn
within three hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time
limit specified in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical
test or tests as described in that section. The court may admit evidence on
the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as
described in this division when a person submits to a blood test at the
request of a law enforcement officer under R.C. § 4511.191 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse,
an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist
shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol,
drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A
person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to
withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of
blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (D)(1)(b) shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C.
§ 3701.143.



         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section,
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.



      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division
(A) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if
there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of
less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions
(A)(1)(b), (A)(1)(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than
the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of division
(A)(1)(j) of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
division does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of
division (B) of this section.



      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the
results of the chemical test shall be made available to the person or the
person’s attorney, immediately upon the completion of the chemical test
analysis. If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of
this section, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or
a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own
choosing administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in
addition to any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If
the person was under arrest as described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense. If the person was under arrest other than described in R.C. §
4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under § 4511.19(A) or (B), shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not
preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.



      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) of
this section, NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration established as an
administration of the United States Department of Transportation under 96
Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. § 105.



         (b)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a
municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a
municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety test to
the operator of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by
clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in
substantial compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible,
and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time
the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any testing
standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, all of the following apply:



            1.   The officer may testify concerning the
results of the field sobriety test so administered.



            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of
the field sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the
criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.



            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is
introduced under division (D)(4)(b)1. or (D)(4)(b)2. of this section and if
the testimony or evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the
court shall admit the testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give
it whatever weight the trier of fact considers to be appropriate.



         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit
or preclude a court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person
was supported by probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a
criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
division, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division
(A)(1)(b), (A)(1)(c), (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), (A)(1)(g), (A)(1)(h),

divisions, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit
by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
division that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:



         (a)   The signature, under oath, of any person who
performed the analysis;



         (b)   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a
controlled substance, or a combination of them that was found;



         (c)   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory
director of a designee of the director that contains the name of each
certified analyst or test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s
or test performer’s employment relationship with the laboratory that issued
the report, and a notation that performing an analysis of the type involved
is part of the analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;



         (d)   An outline of the analyst’s or test
performer’s education, training, and experience in performing the type of
analysis involved and a certification that the laboratory satisfies
appropriate quality control standards in general and, in this particular
analysis, under rules of the Department of Health.



      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the
admission of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of
this section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in
any proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding,
unless the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s
attorney or, if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.



      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of
this section shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or
amount of any substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the

the defendant or the defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend the seven-day
time limit in the interest of justice.

emergency medical technician-intermediate or emergency medical
technician-paramedic who withdraws blood under this section.  The immunity
provided in this division is not available to a person who withdraws blood if
the person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.



      (2)   As used in division (F)(1), EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.

provided in § 91.05 until the complaint is disposed by Mayor's Court.  Each
occasion that an owner or harborer fails to restrict an animal as provided
herein shall constitute a separate offense.  Where the owner or harborer of
an animal which has been restricted in accordance with this subsection or §
91.04 owns or harbors more than one animal subject to this chapter, each
subsequent occasion that the owner or harborer fails to restrict such animal,
whether or not it is the same animal previously restricted, shall be a
separate offense. An owner or harborer failing to restrict their animals as
provided herein shall be subject to the penalties provided in § 91.99.

alleged.  The owner or harborer of the dog or cat shall be entitled to be
present in person or by counsel, to present evidence and to cross-examine
witnesses.  On a finding that an offense has been committed, the Mayor may
enter an order determining that the offending dog or cat is a restricted pet
for such period of time as shall be deemed necessary to protect the safety of
persons and property within the village.  Should the Mayor enter an order
indefinitely restricting an animal, the owner or harborer may thereafter,
upon application and for good cause shown, request the Mayor to modify the
indefinite restriction.

fire, by the permit holder, or the Fire Department, where the fire adds to or
creates a hazardous or objectionable condition.

   (F)   Applications for an open burning permit, as provided for in
this section, shall be made in writing at least ten days prior to the fire
being set and shall be in such form and contain such information as the Fire
Chief may require.  Such application shall include authorization for open
burning from the Ohio Division of Forestry and the Hamilton County
Environmental Services and describe the purpose of the burning, the nature
and quantity of material to be burned, the date of the burning, the location
of the burn site, and the on-site fire-extinguishing equipment to be provided.

§ 93.02  PURPOSE.



   To provide funds for the general fund for general municipal operations,
projected capital requirements and the establishment of adequate reserves for
the normal operations of the village, there is levied a tax on gross income
plus or minus adjustments as hereinafter provided. 



('80 Code, § 94.02) (Ord. 13-73, passed 8-17-73)



§ 93.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.



   (A)   An annual tax for the purposes specified in § 93.02 shall be
imposed at the rate of 0.575% per annum upon the following:



      (1)   Resident individuals. On the adjusted gross income as
defined in § 93.01.



      (2)   Non-resident individuals. On the adjusted gross income
as defined in § 93.01, adjusted by Schedule D of the Ohio Individual Income
Tax Return.



      (3)   Resident C corporations. On all net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter of all resident C corporations.



      (4)   S corporation shareholder’s distributive share. On an
S corporation shareholder’s distributive share of net profits of an S
corporation.



The tax is imposed on the owners of a pass-through entity rather than on the
pass-through entity. No tax shall be imposed under § 93.03(A)(1), (A)(2),
and (A)(3) if the adjusted gross income of an individual or net profits of a
C Corporation does not exceed $5,000 in the taxable year.



   (B)   Consolidated returns.



      (1)   Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or
required in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.



      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on
transactions with its stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case
any person operates a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or
activity, within the village, constituting a portion only of its total
business, the Commissioner shall require the additional information as he may
deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the
village.  If the Commissioner finds net profits are not properly allocated
to the village, by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or
transactions with the division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or
activity or by some other method, he shall make such allocation as he deems
appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the
village.

§ 93.04  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.



   The tax shall be levied, collected, and paid with respect to the gross
income plus or minus adjustments, and with respect to the net profits of
business, professions, and other activities earned from September 1, 1973,
until repealed by action of the Council.  Gross income plus or minus
adjustment and net profits of business, professions, and other activities for
the period September 1, 1973, to December 31, 1973, are to be based on 1/3
the annual amount that would have been used had the effective period included
the entire year 1973.



   (A)   Time for filing.  Each taxpayer, except as herein provided,
shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on or
before April 15 of the year following the effective date of this chapter, and
on or before April 30 of each year thereafter.  When the return is made for
a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of
such fiscal year or period.



   (B)   Returns and contents thereof.  The return shall be filed with
the Tax Commissioner on a form or forms prescribed by or obtainable upon
request from the Commissioner or a generic form setting forth:



      (1)   The aggregate amount of gross income, plus or minus
adjustments, earnings, and profits during the preceding taxable year and
subject to the tax;



      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such
gross income, earnings, and profits;



      (3)   Any other pertinent statements, information, returns, or
other information as the Tax Commissioner may require.



      (4)   Each such return shall have attached to it a copy of the
taxpayer's Ohio State Individual Income Tax return for the same year.



   (C)   Extensions.  The Tax Commissioner may extend the time for
filing of the annual return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of
not to exceed the last day of the month following the month of any extension
date requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing
of the federal income tax return.  The extension may be obtained by filing
with the Tax Commissioner a copy of a request for extension of the time for
filing the federal income tax return, and by paying, on or before April 15,
at least 80% of the tax ultimately determined to be due.  No penalty shall
be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax
paid within the period as extended. Interest shall be assessed on all taxes
unpaid by April 15.  The village may deny a taxpayer's request for extension
if the taxpayer:



      (1)   Fails to timely file the request;



      (2)   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request
(if applicable);



      (3)   Owes the village any delinquent income tax or any
penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax;



      (4)   Has failed to file any required income tax return,
report, or other related document for a prior tax period.



   (D)   Payment with returns.



      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the
filing thereof, pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due
thereon; provided, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of § 93.06 the amount shall
be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any,
shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.



      (2)   Overpayments and refunds.  A taxpayer who has over-paid
the amount of tax to which the village is entitled under the provisions of
this chapter may have the overpayment applied against any subsequent
liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the return, the
overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no additional
taxes or refunds of less than $1 shall be collected or refunded.



   (E)   Amended returns.



      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order
to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund
of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
§§ 93.09 and 93.13.  The amended returns shall be on a form obtained on
request from the Tax Commissioner.  A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.



      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any
federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Indian Hill, Ohio, tax
liability, the taxpayer shall make and file and amended return showing income
subject to the village tax based upon the final determination of federal tax
liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund of any overpayment.

send to the taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.



   (D)   Compromise of penalty, interest, or both.  Subject to the

subject to, or whom the tax commissioner believes is subject to, the
provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any
return made, or if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this
chapter.  Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer, or supposed

the tax commissioner, or his duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities, and opportunity for making the examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.



   (B)   Power to order appearance of taxpayer.  The Tax Commissioner
is authorized to order any person presumed to have knowledge of the facts to

tending to affect the income, and for this purpose may compel the production
of books, papers, records, and federal income tax returns and the attendance
of all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he
believes such persons have knowledge of the income or information pertinent
to the inquiry.

The refusal to produce books, papers, records, and federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to the examination by any employer or

information in violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or penalty of
not more than $500 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both. 
Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.

punishable by immediate dismissal.

Commissioner and provided, further, that in the absence of fraud, neither
penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment
resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the
additional tax is paid within three months after a final determination of the

fraud, omission of a substantial portion of income subject to this tax, or
failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after
three years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever was later,

Commissioner shall be one year from the time of the final determination of
the federal tax liability.

§ 93A.02  PURPOSE.



   (A)   To provide funds for the general fund for general municipal
operations, projected capital requirements and the establishment of adequate
reserves for the normal operations of the village, there is levied, subject
to any exemptions the village may enact that are permitted for qualified
municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.01(A)(1)(b)(ii), an annual tax on
the income of every person residing in the village. The tax shall be measured
by municipal taxable income, as that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01(A).



   (B)   The tax is levied in accordance with, and shall be interpreted
consistent with, the limitations specified in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised
Code, and this chapter hereby incorporates the provisions of Chapter 718 of
the Ohio Revised Code. To the extent a conflict exists between a provision in
this chapter and a provision in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code, the
provision in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code shall apply and control.



(Ord. 07-15, passed 12-14-15)



§ 93A.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.



   (A)   An annual tax for the purposes specified in § 93A.02 shall be
imposed at the rate of 0.55% per annum upon the following:



      (1)   Resident individuals. On the individual’s adjusted
gross income.



      (2)   Part-year- resident individuals. On a prorated portion
of the individual’s adjusted gross income, which proration shall be based
on the number of days that the individual resides in the village during the
taxable year; provided that in the case of an individual who claims the Part-
Year Resident Credit on Nonresident Credit on his or her Ohio income tax
return for the taxable year, it shall be presumed that the portion of the
individual’s adjusted gross income that is subject to the tax is equal to
the individual’s adjusted gross income for the taxable year minus the
portion that was not earned or received in Ohio, as that portion not earned
or received in Ohio is reported on the individual’s Ohio income tax return
for the same taxable year.



      (3)   Resident C corporations. On all net profits earned
during the effective period of this chapter of all resident C corporations.



      (4)   S corporation shareholder’s distributive share. On an
S corporation shareholder’s distributive share of net profits of an S
corporation.



The tax is imposed on the owners of a pass-through entity rather than on the
pass-through entity. No tax shall be imposed under § 93A.03(A)(1), (A)(2),
and (A)(3) if the adjusted gross income of an individual or net profits of a
C Corporation does not exceed $5,000 in the taxable year.



   (B)   Consolidated returns.



      (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016,
a taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect
to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at
least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the
tax imposed by this chapter in that taxable year and if the affiliated group
of corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect
to that taxable year.



         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change
in the reporting method is required under federal law;



         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section; or



         (c)   A taxpayer received permission from the tax
commissioner. The tax commissioner shall approved such a request for good
cause shown.



      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year
following the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax
return election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The
election to discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
binding for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the
election.



      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.



      (4)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that
taxable year if the tax commissioner determines, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s
length and that there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses
with regard to allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A
taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return
for a taxable year shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for
all subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the tax commissioner to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.



      (5)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income
tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties,
fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the village in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members
of such an affiliated group.



      (6)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election
or entered into an agreement with the village before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with the village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.

§ 93A.04  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.



   The tax shall be levied, collected, and paid in accordance with this
chapter from September 1, 1973 until repealed by action of the Council.



   (A)   Procedural history; effective date.



      (1)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to R.C. Chapter
718 were enacted by Am Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and
signed by Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and Am Sub HB 64, passed by
the 131st General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich on June 30, 2015.
These amendments required municipal corporations to conform to and adopt the
provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.



      (2)   As mandated by the above amendments, Council Ordinance
07-15, effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter 93 in
accordance with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 to allow the village to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the village.



      (3)   Ordinance 07-15, effective January 1, 2016, and
corresponding changes to R.C. Chapter 718, apply to taxable years beginning
on or after January 1, 2016. All provisions of this Chapter 93A apply to
taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.



      (4)   Ordinance 07-15 does not repeal the existing sections of
Chapter 93 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter 93
effective January 1, 2016. For taxable years beginning before January 1,
2016, the village shall continue to administer, audit, and enforce the income
tax of the village under R.C. Chapter 718 and ordinances and resolutions of
the village as that Chapter 718 and those ordinances and resolutions existed
before January 1, 2016.



   (B)   Time for filing.  Each taxpayer, except as herein provided,
shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on or
before April 15 of the year following the effective date of this chapter, and
on or before April 30 of each year thereafter.  When the return is made for
a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of
such fiscal year or period.



   (C)   Returns and contents thereof.  The return shall be filed with
the tax commissioner on a form or forms prescribed by or obtainable upon

subject to the tax;



      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such
gross income, earnings, and profits;



      (3)   Any of the following, as the tax commissioner may
require:



         (a)   A taxpayer who is an individual may be required to
include, with each annual return, amended return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: all of
the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service from W-2, “Wage and Tax
Statements.” including all information reported on the taxpayer’s federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported, or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service from 1040 or Ohio IT
1040; and



         (b)   A taxpayer that is not an individual may be
required to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041,
form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with
respect to an amended tax return or refund request, and other documentation
necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the
amended return;



      (4)   Each individual return shall have attached to it a copy
of the taxpayer's Ohio State Individual Income Tax return for the same year.



   (D)   Extensions.



      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested, an automatic
six-month extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return
shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates.



      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal
extension for a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s
federal income tax return shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as that of the extended federal
income tax return.



      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a
six-month extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may
request that the tax commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of
the date for filing the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the
request is received by the tax commissioner on or before the date the
municipal income tax return is due, the tax commissioner shall grant the
taxpayer’s requested extension.



      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not
an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax commissioner
grants an extension of that date.



      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers
the date for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. §
5747.08, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing
of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.



   (E)   Payment with returns.



      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the

thereon; provided, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of § 93A.06 the amount shall
be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any,
shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.



      (2)   Overpayments and refunds.  A taxpayer who has over-paid
the amount of tax to which the village is entitled under the provisions of
this chapter may have the overpayment applied against any subsequent
liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the return, the
overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no additional
taxes or refunds of less than $10 shall be collected or refunded.



   (F)   Amended returns.



      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order
to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund
of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
§§ 93A.09 and 93A.13.  The amended returns shall be on a form obtained on
request from the tax commissioner.  A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.



      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any
federal or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Indian Hill, Ohio,
tax liability, the taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing
income subject to the village tax based upon the final determination of
federal or state tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon

penalties thereon, if any.



      (2)   The tax commissioner may exercise the authority provided

§ 93A.07  INVESTIGATIVE POWER OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER; IDENTIFICATION
INFORMATION; PENALTY FOR DIVULGING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   (A)   Examination of records.  The tax commissioner, or any
authorized employee, is authorized to examine the books, papers records, and
federal income tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person
subject to, or whom the tax commissioner believes is subject to, the
provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any
return made, or if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this
chapter.  Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer, or supposed
taxpayer is hereby directed and required to furnish upon written request by
the tax commissioner, or his duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities, and opportunity for making the examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.



   (B)   Power to order appearance of taxpayer.  The tax commissioner
is authorized to order any person presumed to have knowledge of the facts to
appear before him and may examine the person, under oath, concerning any
income which was or should have been returned for taxation or any transaction
tending to affect the income, and for this purpose may compel the production
of books, papers, records, and federal income tax returns and the attendance
of all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he
believes such persons have knowledge of the income or information pertinent
to the inquiry. The person  may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This Section 93A.07(B) does not authorize the practice of law by
a person who is not an attorney.



   (C)   Identifying Information. When transmitting or otherwise making
use of a tax document that contains a person’s social security number, the
tax commissioner shall take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that
the number is not capable of being viewed by the general public, including,
when necessary, masking the number so that it is not readily discernible by
the general public. The tax commissioner shall not put a person’s social
security number on the outside of any material mailed to the person.



   (D)   Failure to submit identifying information required by tax
commissioner.



      (1)   If the tax commissioner makes a request for identifying
information and the tax commissioner does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the tax commissioner from imposing a penalty upon the person to
whom the request was directed pursuant to § 93A.08, in addition to any
applicable penalty described in § 93A.99 of this chapter.



      (2)   If a person required by the tax commissioner to provide
identifying information does not notify the tax commissioner of a change



with respect to that information as required under division (A) of this
section within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the tax
commissioner from imposing a penalty pursuant to § 93A.08 of this chapter.



      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (D)(1) and
(2) of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax
or fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in
addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in § 93A.99 of this
Chapter 93A for fraud and any other penalties that may be imposed by the tax
commissioner by law.



   (E)   Failure to submit information required by tax commissioner.
The refusal to produce books, papers, records, and federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to the examination by any employer or
person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent,
or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or
the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or
with an order or subpoena of the tax commissioner authorized hereby shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in § 93A.10.



   (F)   Confidential nature of information; penalty for disclosure.



      (1)   Any information gained as the result of any returns,
investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this
chapter shall be confidential, except for official purposes, or except in
accordance with the proper judicial order.  Any person divulging the
information in violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or penalty of
not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both. 
Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.



      (2)   In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the

shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by
suit, as other debts of like amount are recoverable. Except in the case of
fraud, omission of a substantial portion of income subject to this tax, or
failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after
the later of: (1) three years after, the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever was later, and (2) one year after the conclusion of any qualifying
deferral period, as defined in R.C. § 718.12(A)(1)(b)(2); except that, in
those cases in which the Commissioner of internal revenue and the taxpayer
have executed a waiver of the federal statute of limitations, the period in
which an additional assessment may be made by the Commissioner shall be one
year from later of the time of the final determination of the federal tax
liability and the time when the taxpayer files an amended municipal return as
required by R.C. § 718.12(E). In cases of fraud, failure to file a return,
or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be reported,
prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission of the

   (B)   Minimum amount of tax to be collected. Amounts of less than

claim for refund is made within three years from the date on which the
payment was made or the return was due, whichever is later.



      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the
appropriate village official for payment. Except as provided in division
(C)(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The
assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons
for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.



      (3)   If the tax commissioner denies in whole or in part a
refund request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual
income tax return, the tax commissioner shall notify the taxpayer, in writing
of the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under R.C. §
718.11.



   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is
enclosed is not later than the last day for filing the request;



      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a
private postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last
day for filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of
such last day.



      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no
postmark date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or
the date of the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is
received within seven days of the last day for making the request.



   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a
taxpayer of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the
overpayment until the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if
any overpayment is refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the
annual return or 90 days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of
computing the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for
any taxable year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on
which the return on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any
extension of time for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the
interest rate described in R.C. § 718.27(A)(5).



   (F)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income
subject to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax
shown due thereon to make a claim for refund for any overpayment, unless the
tax or overpayment is less than $10.

   (A)   Notice.  Upon the adoption of this subchapter  and the
certification of the village by the FCC, the village or the ICRC shall
immediately notify all cable operators in the village, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, that the village intends to regulate subscriber
rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as
authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.



   (B)   Cable operator response.  Within 30 days of receiving notice
from the village or the ICRC, a cable operator shall file with the village or
the ICRC, its current rates for the basic service tier and associated
equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its
rates.



   (C)   Expedited determination and public hearing.



      (1)   If the Village Council is able to expeditiously
determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as
determined by the applicable benchmark, the Village Council shall:



         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons
may express their views; and



         (b)   Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the
date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the village.



      (2)   If the Village Council or the ICRC takes no action
within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates
with the village, the proposed rates will continue in effect.



      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with
other ICRC communities under the direction of the ICRC.



   (D)   Extended review period.



      (1)   If the Village Council is unable to determine whether
the rates in issue are within the  FCC's  reasonable rate standard based on
the  material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service
showing, the Village Council shall, within 60 days from the date the cable
operator filed its basic cable rates with the village and by adoption of a
formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as
applicable, to make a final determination:



         (a)   Ninety days if the Village Council needs more time
to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or



         (b)   One hundred and fifty days if the cable operator
has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the
applicable benchmark.



      (2)   If the Village Council has not made a decision within
the 90- or 150-day period, the Village Council shall issue a brief written
order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate
account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose
behalf the amounts are paid.



   (E)   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before
taking action on the proposed rate, the Village Council or the ICRC shall
hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views and record objections.



   (F)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an
objection to the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to
record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in
writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an
objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the
secretary with the objector's name and address.



   (G)   Benchmark analysis.  If a cable operator submits its current
basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable
rate standard, the Village Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using
the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the
FCC.  Based on the Village Council or the ICRC's findings, the initial basic
cable rates shall be established as follows:



      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the
benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the
cable operator's rates will be capped at that level.



      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark,
the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on
September 30, 1992, reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted
for  inflation  and  any change in the number of channels occurring
between September 30, 1992 and the initial date of regulation.



      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark,
but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on
September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark,
adjusted for inflation.



   (H)   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator does not wish
to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the
opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an
initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard.  The
Village Council will review a cost-of-service review.  The Village Council
may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable
operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable
operator's September 30, 1992 rates minimum 10%, will prescribe the cable
operator's new rates.



   (I)   Decision.



      (1)   By formal resolution.  After completion by the village
or the ICRC of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the Village
Council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution.  The decision shall
include one of the following:



         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable
rate standard or is justified by a cost-of- service analysis, the Village
Council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable
operator; or



         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable
rate standard and the cost-of- service analysis, if any, does not justify the
proposed rates, the Village Council shall establish initial basic cable rates
that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a
cost-of-service analysis.



      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds.  If the Village Council
determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the
reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing
justifies lower rates, the Village Council may order the rates reduced in
accordance with divisions (G) or (H) above as applicable.  In addition, the
Village Council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds
of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable
rates published by the Internal  Revenue Service for tax refunds and
additional tax  payments), retroactive  to September 1, 1993.  The method
for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC
regulations as directed in the Village Council's decision resolution.



      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. 
If rates proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or
if there were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the
resolution must state the reasons for the decision and the Village Council
must give public notice of its decision.  Public notice will be given by
advertisement once in the official newspaper of the village.



   (J)   Appeal.  The Village Council's decision concerning rates for
the basic service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in
accordance with applicable federal regulations.



(Ord. 25-93, passed 12-20-93)



§ 111.17  REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.



   (A)   Notice.  A cable operator in the village who wishes to
increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall
file a request with the village and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at
least 30 days before the cable operator desires the increase to take
effect.  This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until
at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates.



   (B)   Expedited determination and public hearing.



      (1)   If the Village Council or the ICRC is able  to
expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for
basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as
determined by the applicable price cap, the Village Council shall:



         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons
may express their views: and



         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days
from the date the cable operator filed its request with the village.



      (2)   If the Village Council takes no action within 30 days
from the date the cable operator filed its request with the village, the
proposed rates will go into effect.



      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the Village Council or the ICRC shall hold at
least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views
and record objections.



   (C)   Extended review period.



      (1)   If the Village Council and the ICRC are unable to
determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate
standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a
cost-of-service showing, the Village Council shall, by adoption of a formal
resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time as applicable, to
make a final determination:



         (a)   Ninety days if the Village Council or the ICRC
needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's
reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and



         (b)   One hundred and fifty days if the cable operator
has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase
above the applicable price cap.



      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended
review period.



      (3)   If the Village Council has not made a decision within
the 90- to 150-day period, the Village Council shall issue a brief written
order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate
account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and
on whose behalf the amounts are paid.



   (D)   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before
taking action on the requested rate increase, the Village Council or the ICRC
shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may
express their views and record objections.



   (E)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an
objection to the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record
the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in
writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an
objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the
secretary with the objector's name and address.



   (F)   Delayed determination.  If the Village Council is unable to
make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the
extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect,
subject to subsequent refund if the Village Council later issued a decision
disapproving any portion of the increase.



   (G)   Price cap analysis.  If a cable operator presents its request
for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the
Village Council shall review the rate using a price cap analysis in
accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based on the
Village Council's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as
follows:



      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the
price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new
basic cable rates.



      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the
price cap established by the FCC, the Village Council shall disapprove the
proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the
price cap.



   (H)   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator submits a
cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the
price cap, the Village Council will review the submission pursuant the FCC
standards for cost-of-service review.  The Village Council may approve a
rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary
showing; however, a cost-of- service determination resulting in a rate below
the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe
the cable operator's new rate.



   (I)   Decision.  The Village Council's decision concerning the
requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate
increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or
if objections were made by other parties to  the proposed rate 
increases,  the  resolution  must state the reasons for the decision. 
Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the
secretary to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at anytime
before the decision resolution is adopted.



   (J)   Refunds.



      (1)   The Village Council may order refunds of subscribers'
rate payments with interest if:



         (a)   The Village Council was unable to make a decision
within the extended time periods as described in division (C) above; and



         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase
at the end of the extended review period; and



         (c)   The Village Council determines that the rate
increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable
operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of- service showing,
and the Village Council disapproves any portion of the rate increase.



      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate
will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Village
Council's decision resolution.



   (K)   Appeal.  The Village Council's decision concerning rates for
the basic service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in
accordance with applicable federal regulations.

instrument in response to a notice of discontinuance shall not constitute
payment and the operator shall not be required to issue an additional notice
prior to discontinuance.

§ 130.05  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.



   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific
intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a
prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the
offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific
intention to engage in conduct of that nature.



   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the
person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain
result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of
circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably
exist. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of
an offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes
that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry
or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.



   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to
the consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk
that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to
exist.



   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the
person’s conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.
A person is negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a
substantial lapse from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk
that such circumstances may exist.



   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence
suffices to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or
purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness
suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient
culpability for such element.



(R.C. § 2901.22)  ('80 Code, § 130.04)  (Ord. 3-80, passed 1-28-80)



§ 130.06  ATTEMPT.



   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or
knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall
engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the
offense.



   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in
retrospect, commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was
either factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if
that offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been
as the actor believed them to be.



   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense,
of complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.



   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section
that the actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise
prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.



   (E)   (1)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt
to commit an offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an
offense for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of
the first degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount
or number of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug
abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense
attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had
involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance that
is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other offense is an offense
of the next lesser degree than the offense attempted. In the case of an
attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that
is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor of the first
degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt
to commit a violation of any provision of R.C. Chapter 3734, other than R.C.
§ 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a minor
misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.



      (2)   In addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to
division (E)(1) of this section for an attempt to commit aggravated murder or
murder in violation of division (A) of this section, if the offender used a
motor vehicle as the means to attempt to commit the offense, the court shall
impose upon the offender a class two suspension of the offenders drivers
license, commercial drivers license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege as specified in R.C.
§ 4510.02(A)(2).



      (3)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to
attempted rape and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification
of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1418, 2941.1419, or 2941.1420, the
offender shall be sentenced to a prison term or term of life imprisonment
pursuant to R.C. § 2971.03.



   (F)   As used in this section:



      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.



      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

§ 130.07  COMPLICITY.



   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for
the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:



      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;



      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;



      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation
of R.C. § 2923.01;



      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the
offense.



   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person
with whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal
offender.



   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section
unless an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of
complicity in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.



   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against
the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in
the commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with
R.C. § 2923.03(D).



   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section
that, prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.



   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or
she were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms
of this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

§ 130.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.



   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of
the following circumstances:



      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an
officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and
within the scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or
employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the
officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is
accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those
provisions shall apply.



      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly
appears in the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by
an officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and
within the scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or
employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the
officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is
accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, those
provisions shall apply.



      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a
specific duty imposed by law on the organization.



      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise
required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized,
requested, commanded, tolerated, or performed by the board of directors,
trustees, partners, or by a high managerial officer, agent, or employee
acting in behalf of the organization and within the scope of such a board’s
or person’s office or employment.



   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an
offense, a purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed,
unless the contrary plainly appears.



   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than
one for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high
managerial officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over
the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its
commission. This defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent
with the purpose of the section defining the offense.



   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for
profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.



(R.C. § 2901.23)



§ 130.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.



   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such
organization, if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of the offense, and any of the following apply:



      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or
she engages in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage
in such conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he
or she has direct responsibility;



      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty
imposed on the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.



   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this
section, he or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted
in his or her own behalf.



(R.C. § 2901.24)



§ 130.10  SELF-DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.



   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE and VEHICLE have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 2901.05.



   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a
criminal offense, a person who lawfully is in that person’s residence has
no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an
occupant of that person’s vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a
vehicle owned by an immediate family member of the person has no duty to
retreat before using force in self-defense or defense of another.



(R.C. § 2901.09)



§ 130.99  PENALTY.



   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body
of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall
be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than
$500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.



(R.C. § 715.67)



   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.



      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or
minor misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of
any municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or
minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be
guided by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding
purposes of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future
crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those
purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon
the victim and the need for changing the offenders behavior, rehabilitating
the defender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense, the
public, or the victim and the public.



      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of
a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section
shall be reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of
misdemeanor sentencing set forth in division (B)(1) of this section,
commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offenders
conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed
for similar offenses committed by similar offenders.



      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision
or for a violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division
(B)(1) of this section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic
background, gender, or religion of the offender.



      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not
apply to any offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of
any court pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of
any provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that
is disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.



(R.C. § 2929.21)



   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.



      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or
division (C)(5) or (C)(6) of this section and unless another term is required
or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence
upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail
term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:



         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more
than 180 days;



         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more
than 90 days;



         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more
than 60 days;



         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more
than 30 days.



      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail
term under division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the
sentence in intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of
the offender as provided in division (E)(2) of this section.  The court
retains jurisdiction over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail
sentence imposed at any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory
jail term.



         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. §
2935.01, has filed a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be
notified about a particular case and if the court is considering modifying
the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the court shall notify the
prosecutor that the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of the
offender in that case. The prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the
court’s consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in
that case, and, if the prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify
the eligible offender of the hearing.



            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing
regarding the court’s consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the
offender in that case, the court shall hold the hearing before considering
whether or not to release the offender from the offender’s jail sentence.



      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county
jail that has established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. §
5147.30, the court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the
offender may be considered for participation in the program. During the
offender’s term in the county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to
modify its specification regarding the offender’s participation in the
county jail industry program.



      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to
division (C) of this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence
pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local
detention facility in which the term is to be served is covered by a policy
adopted pursuant to R.C. §§ 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02,
753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the
following apply:



         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as
part of the sentence:



            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized
bill pursuant to R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the
person is required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.



            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill
described in division (C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill
by the times specified in R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a
certificate of judgment against the person as described in that section.



         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any
certificate of judgment issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this
section.



      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of
the type described in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term
on the offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The
additional jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the
Revised Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively
to and prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and
consecutively to any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.



      (6)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty
to a misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification
of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail
term on the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon
the offender an additional definite jail term as follows:



            1.   Subject to division (C)(6)(a)2. of this
section, an additional definite jail term of not more than 60 days;



            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C.
§ 2907.22, 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one
or more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more
than 120 days.



         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail
term under division (C)(6)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose
on the offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time
processing, continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period
of time specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court
shall equal the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have
imposed upon the offender under division (C)(6)(a) of this section. A
sanction imposed under this division shall commence on the date specified by
the court, provided that the sanction shall not commence until after the
offender has served the jail term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of
R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and any residential sanction imposed for the
violation under division (E) of this section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction
imposed under this division shall be considered to be a community control
sanction for purposes of division (D) or this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and
all provisions of this code and the Ohio Revised Code that pertain to
community control sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this
division, except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly
inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs associated with a sanction
imposed under this division, including the cost of the use of the monitoring
device.



      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that
charges that the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew
was pregnant at the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the
offender a mandatory jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.



      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under
this division (C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the
offender and the jail term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s
own motion, the court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the
circumstances warrant, may substitute one or more community control sanctions
under division (E) or (F) of this section for any jail days that are not
mandatory jail days.



(R.C. § 2929.24)



   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.



      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 and
2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for
a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do
either of the following:



            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of
one or more community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or
(G) of this section. The court may impose any other conditions of release
under a community control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If
the court imposes a jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any
community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions in
addition to the jail term.



            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this
section from the range of jail terms authorized under that division for the
offense, suspend all or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the
offender under a community control sanction or combination of community
control sanctions authorized under divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.



         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions
imposed upon an offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not
exceed five years.



         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a
community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions
pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the
duration of the community control sanctions imposed and shall notify the
offender that if any of the conditions of the community control sanctions are
violated the court may do any of the following:



            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community
control sanction if the total time under all of the offender’s community
control sanctions does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division
(D)(1)(b) of this section;



            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control
sanction under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is
not required to impose any particular sanction or sanctions;



            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of
jail terms authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.



      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to
division (D)(1)(a)1. of this section, the sentencing court retains
jurisdiction over the offender and the period of community control for the
duration of the period of community control. Upon the motion of either party
or on the court’s own motion, the court, in the court’s sole discretion
and as the circumstances warrant, may modify the community control sanctions
or conditions of release previously imposed, substitute a community control
sanction or condition of release for another community control sanction or
condition of release previously imposed, or impose an additional community
control sanction or condition of release.



      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any
community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions
authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall
place the offender under the general control and supervision of the court or
of a department of probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for
purposes of reporting to the court a violation of any of the conditions of
the sanctions imposed. If the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a
department of probation has been established to serve the municipal court or
county court in that jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the
municipal court or the county court to receive the offender into the general
control and supervision of that department of probation for purposes of
reporting to the sentencing court a violation of any of the conditions of the
sanctions imposed. The sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any
offender whom it sentences for the duration of the sanction or sanctions
imposed.



         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition
of any community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not
leave the state without the permission of the court or the offender’s
probation officer. In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the
offender, and ensuring the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose
additional requirements on the offender.  The offender’s compliance with
the additional requirements also shall be a condition of the community
control sanction imposed upon the offender.



      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender
sentences the offender to any community control sanction or combination of
community control sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of
this section, and the offender violates any of the conditions of the
sanctions, the public or private person or entity that supervises or
administers the program or activity that comprises the sanction shall report
the violation directly to the sentencing court or to the department of
probation or probation officer with general control and supervision over the
offender. If the public or private person or entity reports the violation to
the department of probation or probation officer, the department or officer
shall report the violation to the sentencing court.



         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a
community control sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator
one or more of the following penalties:



            1.   A longer time under the same community
control sanction if the total time under all of the community control
sanctions imposed on the violator does not exceed the five- year limit
specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;



            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;



            3.   A combination of community control sanctions,
including a jail term.



         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. §
2925.11(B)(2)(b), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in
so doing violated the conditions of a community control sanction based on a
minor drug possession offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing
court may consider the offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical
assistance for another in good faith or for self or may consider the offender
being the subject of another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance
in accordance with that division as a mitigating factor before imposing any
of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.



         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator
pursuant to division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail
for the misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community
control sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the
offense for which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may
reduce the longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under
the longer sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division
(D)(4)(b) of this section by all or part of the time the violator
successfully spent under the sanction that was initially imposed.



      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an
offender, for a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a
community control sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of
this section in an exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time
under the community control sanction or impose a less restrictive community
control sanction. Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction
does not relieve the offender of a duty to make restitution under division
(G) of this section.



(R.C. § 2929.25)



   (E)   Community residential sanction.



      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law,
the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor
misdemeanor, may impose upon the offender any community residential sanction
or combination of community residential sanctions under this division (E). 
Community residential sanctions include, but are not limited to, the
following:



         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a
term in a halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the
offense, whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;



         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as
defined in R.C. § 307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing
center or district community alternative sentencing center established and
operated in accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in
that section, with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the
offender successfully complete the portion of the sentence to be served in
the center.



      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under
division (E)(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. §
307.932. In all other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a
community residential sanction under this division (E) may do either or both
of the following:



         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s
sentence in intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other
time or times that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s
occupation or care for the offender’s family;



         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the
offender may seek or maintain employment, receive education or training,
receive treatment, perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an
obligation imposed by law or by the court. A release pursuant to this
division shall be only for the duration of time that is needed to fulfill the
purpose of the release and for travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill
the purposes of release.



      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the
income earned by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of
this section be applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G)
of this section.



      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for
a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.



      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of
or pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as
described in division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at
other times the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house,
community alternative sentencing center, district community alternative
sentencing center, or other place at which the offender will serve the
residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of
the operation of the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center,
district community alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause
the convicted offender to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV
infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
and other contagious diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the
halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place at which the offender will
serve the residential sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway
house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place who refuses to be tested or
treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not
limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious disease to be tested
and treated involuntarily.



      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a
halfway house for use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders
under a sanction imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.



(R.C. § 2929.26)



   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.



      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law,
the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor
misdemeanor, may impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or
combination of nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. 
Nonresidential sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:



         (a)   A term of day reporting;



         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous
alcohol monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol
monitoring without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring;



         (c)   A term of community service of up to  500 hours
for misdemeanor of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the
second, third, or fourth degree;



         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of
security for the offender as determined necessary by the court;



         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;



         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;



         (g)   A term of monitored time;



         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring,
including random drug testing;



         (i)   A curfew term;



         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;



         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education
or training;



         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of
the victim, a requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender
mediation;



         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the
offender’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or
forfeiture of the offender’s motor vehicle, a requirement that the offender
obtain a valid motor vehicle operator’s license, or any other related
sanction;



         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling
if the offense is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance involving a person who was a
family or household member at the time of the violation, if the offender
committed the offense in the vicinity of one or more children who are not
victims of the offense, and if the offender or the victim of the offense is a
parent, guardian, custodian, or person in loco parentis of one or more of
those children. This division does not limit the court in requiring that the
offender obtain counseling for any offense or in any circumstance not
specified in this division.



      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service
pursuant to division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that
the court modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.



      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division
(F)(1) of this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve
a mandatory jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to
discourage the offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if
the sanction is reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles
of misdemeanor sentencing.



      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor
may impose a term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The
term of community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30
hours.  After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the
sentence to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court,
to the appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this
section.



(R.C. § 2929.27)



   (G)   Financial sanctions.



      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. §
2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor,
including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial
sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division
(G). If the court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions,
the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include,
but are not limited to, the following:



         (a)   Restitution.



            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor
misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving
the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of
the offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon
the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose restitution as a
sanction pursuant to this division if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or
could be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under
Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order
that the restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult
probation department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court
on behalf of the victim.



            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court
shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the
court imposes restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it
orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence
investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing
or replacing propert9, and other information, provided that the amount the
court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss
suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of
the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold
an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor
disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary
hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the
offender.



            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited
against any recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim
or any survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce
evidence of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for
purposes of imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.



            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court
may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the
amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for
collecting and processing restitution payments.



            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may
request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may
file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any restitution
ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as
it determines appropriate.



         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions
(G)(1)(b)1. and 2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as
required by law:



            1.   A fine in the following amount:



               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree,
not more than $1,000;



               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree,
not more than $750;



               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree,
not more than $500;



               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree,
not more than $250;



               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than
$150.



            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. §
2949.111.



         (c)   Reimbursement.



            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all
of the costs of sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not
limited to, the following:



               A.   All or part of the costs of
implementing any community control sanction, including a supervision fee
under R.C. § 2951.021;



               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement
in a jail or other residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per
diem fee for room and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and
the costs of repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;



               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing
and using an immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition
interlock device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders
an offender to use under R.C. § 4510.13.



            2.   The amount of reimburse- ment under division
(G)(1)(c)1. of this section shall not exceed the total amount of
reimbursement the offender is able to pay and shall not exceed the actual
cost of the sanctions. The court may collect any amount of reimbursement the
offender is required to pay under that division. If the court does not order
reimbursement under that division, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant
to a repayment policy adopted under R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the
offender may be required to pay the fees specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in
accordance with that section.



      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary,
the court may hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay
the financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs
or is likely in the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.



         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is
indigent and unable to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court
shall consider imposing and may impose a term of community service under
division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or
court costs. If the court does not determine that the offender is indigent,
the court may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of
this section in lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction under
this division (G) and in addition to imposing court costs. The court may
order community service for a minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4)
of this section in lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction
under this section and in addition to imposing court costs. If a person fails
to pay a financial sanction or court costs, the court may order community
service in lieu of the financial sanction or court costs.



      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed
upon the offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the
costs incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division
(E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section
to the county treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the county’s general fund. The county shall use the
amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the county
pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this
section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (E) of this section.



         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon
the offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division  (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used
to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of
this section to the treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer
shall deposit the reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general
fund. The municipal corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any
sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in
operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed
under division (E) of this section.



         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a
private provider pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or
(G) of this section to the provider.



      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed
under this division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for
misdemeanor domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of
not less than $70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the
Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address confidentiality program fund
created by R.C. § 111.48.



      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division
(G)(5), a financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is
a judgment in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates
the court that imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to
the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of
reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon
an offender is a judgment in favor of the entity administering the community
control sanction, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c)1.b. of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or
other residential facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the
jail or other residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the
victim of the offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a
certificate of judgment as described in division (G)(1)(b)1. of this section,
through a certificate of judgment as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of
this section, through execution as described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this
section or through an order as described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this
section and the offender shall be considered for purposes of the collection
as a judgment debtor.



         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment
or order under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or
political subdivision may do any of the following:



            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which
the judgment was entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;



            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order
through any available procedure, including any of the procedures identified
in R.C. § 2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.



            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages
of the judgment debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.



      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(4) of
this section for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do
not preclude, enforcement of the criminal sentence.



      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an
offender under this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or
another person to collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another
person authorized by law or the court to collect the financial sanction may
do the following:



         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public
agencies or private vendors for the collection of amounts due under the
sanction. Before entering into a contract for the collection of amounts due
from an offender pursuant to any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this
division (G), a court shall comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.



         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the
sanction in installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other
reasonable method, in any time, and on any terms that the court considers
just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed
five years. If the court is a county court or a municipal court operated by a
county, the acceptance of payments by any financial transaction device shall
be governed by the policy adopted by the board of county commissioners of the
county pursuant to R.C. § 301.28. If the court is a municipal court not
operated by a county, the clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an
electronic transfer out of public money or may charge the fee to the offender.



         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a
reasonable fee to an offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump
sum payment of any financial sanction.



      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G)
shall preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.



(R.C. § 2929.28)



   (H)   Organizational penalties.



      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this
section, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 130.09 shall
be fined by the court as follows:



         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more
than $5,000;



         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more
than $4,000;



         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more
than $3,000;



         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more
than $2,000;



         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;



         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not
more than $2,000;



         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically
classified, not more than $1,000.



      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty
provided in this section.



      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
that provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to
the penalty provided for violation of the section defining the offense.



      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of
available civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense
pursuant to § 130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed
pursuant to this section.

that it contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and
description of unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance. In any criminal prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2925.041 or
a violation of this chapter, R.C. Chapter 2925 or R.C. Chapter 3719 that is
based on the possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound,

performing the analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of
the alleged offense have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings
as to the content, weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima
facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight of the substances.



      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized
statement by the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and
stating that the signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report

the benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst
employed by the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a
qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a
representative sample of the entire substance that is, or of each of the
substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation and shall be of
sufficient size, in the opinion of the court, to permit the accused's analyst
to make a thorough scientific analysis concerning the identity of the
substance or substances. The prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the
trial is to be held in a court not of record or unless the accused person is
charged with a minor misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney
shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample portion at least three
days prior to trial. If the prosecuting attorney determines that such a
sample portion cannot be preserved and given to the accused's analyst, the
prosecuting attorney shall so inform the accused person, or the accuseds
attorney. In such a circumstance, the accused person is entitled, upon
written request made to the prosecuting attorney, to have the accuseds
privately employed or court appointed analyst present at an analysis of the
substance that is, or the substances that are, the basis of the alleged
violation, and, upon further written request, to receive copies of all
recorded scientific data that result from the analysis and that can be used
by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning

misdemeanor violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written
request made to the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the
accuseds choice, or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court, present at a measurement or weighing of the
substance that is the basis of the alleged violation. Also, the accused
person is entitled, upon further written request, to receive copies of all
recorded scientific data that result from the measurement or weighing and
that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of unit doses of the
substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

on any substance that was the basis of, or involved in, the offense to
determine whether the substance contained any amount of a controlled
substance if the results of the tests indicate that the substance tested
contained any controlled substance. No court shall order an offender under
this section to pay the costs of tests performed on a substance if the
results of the tests do not indicate that the substance tested contained any
controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to determine the amount
of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may hold the hearing as

conforming to that recommended or accepted by the federal department of
defense, office of civil defense, or



      (2)   Such other design conforming to that approved and
adopted by the City Manager as being the equivalent of the design approved in
B(1) hereof.



   (C)   A family fallout shelter shall, in all matters relating to

applicants for building permits shall be required to make a deposit of $150
in cash at the time of payment for the building permit.  The deposit will be
retained by the City Manager as security against the cost of cleaning the mud
from the streets and highways of the village during the course of the
construction or remodeling contemplated by the building permit; however, in
the event that the work contemplated by the building permit will not, in the
opinion of the Manager, require the excavation or other removal or movement
of earth, the deposit will not be required.



   (B)   When, in the opinion of the Manager, the construction or
remodeling work contemplated by the building permit has been completed to the
extent that there is little likelihood of any mud being tracked onto the

   (A)   The City Manager shall review all building permit applications
for new construction or substantial improvements to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding.  If a
proposed building site is in a location that has a flood hazard, any proposed
new construction or substantial improvement (including prefabricated and
mobile homes) must:



      (1)   Be designed (or modified) and anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure,



      (2)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that

electrical, and water systems are located, elevated, and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage, and



      (3)   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.



   (C)   The City Manager shall require new or replacement water supply
systems and/or sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from
the systems into flood water, and require on-site waste disposal systems to
be located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them
during flooding.

§ 151.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants
municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for
promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   The village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the
flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve
the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare, and to:



   (A)   Protect human life and health;



   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;



   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;



   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper
use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect
property and minimize future flood blight areas;



   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;



   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties
within and near flood prone areas;



   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;



   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;



   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and



   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.



   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods
and provisions for:



   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;



   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,



   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood
hazards in other areas.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.



   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard
within the jurisdiction of the village, as identified in § 151.06, including
any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the village.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.



   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:

are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these
regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on file at the village
Administration Building, 6525 Drake Road, Cincinnati Ohio 45243.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
(resolutions) including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In
the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance
(resolution), the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall
not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to
such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.08  INTERPRETATION.



   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all
provisions shall be:



   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;



   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,



   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted

precedence over these regulations.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the
village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations
or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.



(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.10  DEFINITIONS.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE.   A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.



   APPEAL.   A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.



   BASE FLOOD.   The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the
one percent chance annual flood or 100 year flood.



   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).   The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the
base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).



   BASEMENT.   Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source.



   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).   Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).   An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES.   Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:



      (1)   ZONE A :  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; base flood elevations are not determined.



      (2)   ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE :  Special flood hazard areas
inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.



      (3)   ZONE AO :  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on
sloping terrain); average depths are determined.

protection system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.



      (6)   ZONE B and ZONE X (SHADED) :  Areas of 500-year flood;
areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot
or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas
protected by levees from the base flood.

outside the 500-year floodplain.



   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).   The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations
of the base flood.



   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.   The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus any freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.



   FLOODWAY.  



      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to
pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a
hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative
increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no
more than a designated height. In no case shall the designated height be more
than one foot at any point within the community.



      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate
to high erosion forces.



   FREEBOARD.   A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris
and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.



   HISTORIC STRUCTURE.   Any structure that is:



      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic
Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or
preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the
requirements for individual listings on the National Register;



      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary
of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a
registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; or



      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of
historic places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.



      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places
maintained by the village whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.



   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEER-ING ANALYSIS.   An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.



   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).   A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:



      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).   A revision based on
technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a
designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective
Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not
located in a special flood hazard area.



      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).   A revision based on
technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood
zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and
planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood
hazard area.



      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR).   A formal
review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the
minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A
CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.



   LOWEST FLOOR.   The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in
accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these
regulations for enclosures below the lowest floor.



   MANUFACTURED HOME.   A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.
The term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE . For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.



   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK.   As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.



   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP).   The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused
by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will
make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.



   NEW CONSTRUCTION.   Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the village Flood
Insurance Rate Map, May 1, 1985, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.



   PERSON.   Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state
and local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. §
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college
district, technical college district, or state community college. "Agency"
does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant
general's department, or any court.



   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.   A vehicle which is built on a single chassis,
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection,
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck,
and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.



   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT.   A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. § 4703.01 to
4703.19.



   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER.   A person registered as a
professional engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.



   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR.   A person registered as a
professional surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.



   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.   Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD
HAZARD AREAS may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.



   START OF CONSTRUCTION.   The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home
on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation
of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does
it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of a building.



   STRUCTURE.   A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.



   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.   Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:



      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction;"



      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified prior to the application for a
development permit by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or



      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that
the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".



   VARIANCE.   A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.



   VIOLATION.   The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have
technical data, required in accordance with this division, prepared in a
format required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map
Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map
revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant.



      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development
permit for:



         (a)   Proposed floodway encroach-ments that increase the
base flood elevation; and



         (b)   Proposed development which increases the base
flood elevation by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base
flood elevations but no floodway.



      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of
Map Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division

Administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an
effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a
submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing
by the City Manager of the village, and may be submitted at any time.



   (C)   Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
village's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the village's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the village
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the
new area for which the village has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.

   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard
areas, or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation and floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data
available from a federal, state, or other source.



   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA
flood maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain
Administrator.



   (C)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood
Insurance Study have been provided by FEMA:



      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
the FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all
previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.



      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination
by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required
where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the
preliminary base flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood
elevations and/or floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from
FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.



   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in § 151.60 through 151.65, Appeals and Variances.



   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard
and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
established high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.

event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:



      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in
special flood hazard areas;



      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged
structures located in special flood hazard areas; and



      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of
substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain
development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.



   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the
floodplain development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating
with other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial
damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and
other information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in
special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged
structures with increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

§ 151.49  ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.



   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in
these regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure
that the reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is
minimized:



   (A)   Development in floodways.



      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase
in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional
engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation; or



      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the
base flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are
completed by the applicant:



         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in
§ 151.29(A);



         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives which would not
result in increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;



         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in
areas which would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;



         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all
impacted property owners within and outside the community, explaining the
impact of the proposed action on their property; and



         (e)   Concurrence of the City Manager of the village and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.



   (B)    Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but
no floodways.



      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
base flood elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,



      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no
floodways have been designated causing more than one foot increase in the
base flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are
completed by the applicant:



         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result
in an increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an
explanation why these alternatives are not feasible;



         (b)   Division (A)(2)(a) and (c) through (e) of this
section.



   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its
banks. The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination
of the "bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be
based on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General
Technical Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide
to Field Technique or other applicable publication available from a federal,
state, or other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that
alter a watercourse, the following standards apply:



      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of the proposed development, and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of
the watercourse will not be diminished.



      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
such notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.



      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the
necessary maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The
Floodplain Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an
agreement with the village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.



      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit
technical data in § 151.29(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse
results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area,
including the placement of culverts.

(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04)



§ 151.61  POWERS AND DUTIES.



   (A)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or
enforcement of these regulations.

§ 151.63  VARIANCES.



   (A)   Any person believing that the use and development standards of
these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the
lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations
would result in unnecessary hardship.



      (1)   Application for a variance.



         (a)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which
a variance is sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it
with the Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall
transmit it to the Appeals Board.



         (b)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the
following information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant;
legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing
use; description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description
of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request.



         (c)   All applications for a variance shall be
accompanied by a variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted
by the village.



      (2)   Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall
schedule and hold a public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of
general circulation in the community at least ten days before the date of the
hearing.



      (3)   Public hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall
present such statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In
considering such variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and
make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of these regulations and the following factors:



         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other
lands to the injury of others.



         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage.



         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and
its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.



         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the
proposed facility to the community.



         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the
proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.



         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront
location, where applicable.



         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with
existing and anticipated development.



         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area.



         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.



         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of
rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site.



         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services
during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems,
and streets and bridges.



   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon:



      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.



      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of
these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the
applicant.



      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public
expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws.



      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development
is protected by methods to minimize flood damages.



      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.



   (C)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of
these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.



   (D)   Other conditions for variances.



      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.



      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction
and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items in division (A)(3)(a)
to (k) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.



      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a
lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood

§ 152.01  PREAMBLE.



   This land use plan is part of a continuous and ongoing planning process
designed to implement the intent and purpose of the Village Charter and to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the present and future residents
of the village.  The plan addresses the types and intensities of land uses
and the system of roadways that are consistent with the village's Charter
objective of maintaining its rural character and protecting its unique
natural environment.  As such, the plan not only addresses future conditions
but also affirms prior land use policies, as implemented through the
village's existing zoning code, that continue to achieve the village's
Charter objective of remaining a rural-residential community.  The plan
addresses the issues of land use and environmental protection in terms of
current knowledge of existing conditions.  As this plan is implemented and
new conditions arise, the plan may be reviewed, and, if necessary, modified
to reflect the village's informed response to the new circumstances.



('80 Code, § 155.01) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)



§ 152.02  TOPOGRAPHICAL CHARACTERISTICS.



   (A)   The village comprises 19.5 square miles and is bounded on the
east and the south by the Little Miami River, with village boundaries that
roughly correspond to the physical break between the river bottom lands and
the steeply sloping valley walls.  To the west, the village boundaries are
defined by the municipal corporate limits of Montgomery, Madeira, and
Mariemont.  To the north, the village limits are defined by I-275.  There
is a general gradient toward the river with the highest and most level land
being located on the west and the lowest land located in the river bottoms. 
Most of the area is divided by ravines and stream valleys which form the
area's drainage pattern.  In the north, Sycamore Creek's three branches
divide the northern half of the village into a series of natural
neighborhoods.  Walton Creek, Redbird Hollow, and smaller streams
paralleling Indian Hill, Shawnee Run, Kugler Mill, and Camargo Roads also
break up the community into a series of smaller natural neighborhood areas.



   (B)   The most rugged terrain in the village is nearest the Little
Miami River.  On the steeper slopes, unstable soil conditions are found in a
geologic formation known as the Kope formation.  These conditions are most
in evidence along Sycamore Creek and along the Little Miami River. 
Construction on these areas or above them should not be permitted.  Other
major environmental features such as woodlands, steep slopes, and ravines are
likely to physically overlap, although woodlands are also frequently found in
the flatter upland areas as well.  Most of the scenic views in the village
are views across the ravines and stream valleys, while the bottoms of ravines
and stream valleys provide scenic drives.  A complete inventory of the
village's topographical characteristics and environmental resources is
detailed in the village's "Green Areas Study" (December 1977), which is
hereby incorporated by reference in this plan.



('80 Code, § 155.02) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)



§ 152.03  CHARTER OBJECTIVE.



   (A)   When the village was incorporated in 1941, the village was a
rural neighborhood of farms and single-family homes situated at the outer
edge of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.  The villages to the west of this
village were also mostly rural, but gradually becoming suburban in
character.  It was the vision of the framers of the Village Charter that the
village should maintain its rural character.  Consistent with this
objective, the village fathers recognized the need for a transition from
these communities to the west by providing for a gradual decrease in density
along portions of the western border.  Subsequent village annexations and
land use decisions were consistent with this pattern of decreasing density.



   (B)   This transition in intensity of development, and the
topographical characteristics described above, define two logical gradients
in the village, both of which generally flow from west to east.  These two
gradients are shown in the land use map which is attached to this plan and
made a part hereof.  The village has continued to serve as a natural and
logical geographical area of rural relief to the increasing sprawl of the
Cincinnati suburbs.  The village is located along a major physical boundary,
the Little Miami River, and its stream valleys and steep ravines are ideally
suited for low-density development.  The expanse of the village gives it an
appropriate size for maintaining the desired rural character and providing
rural relief within the metropolitan area.



('80 Code, § 155.03) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)



§ 152.04  ROADWAY SYSTEM.



   (A)   Interstate highways (I-275, I-71) and major arterials run to
the west, north, east, and south of the village.  The major arterials are
Montgomery Road (U.S. 22, State Route 3) and Wooster Pike (U.S. 50). 
Together, these interstate highways and major arterials provide for needed
regional access.  Within the village itself, there are only three minor
arterials and one major collector which are suitable for traffic movement
between local streets and the regional roadway network.  Two of these minor
arterials that run in an east-west direction are Remington Road and Shawnee
Run Road.  The major collector, Indian Hill Road, also runs in an east-west
direction.  The third minor arterial is Loveland-Madeira.  It angles
through the village in a northeasterly direction.  These roads run past the
boundaries of the village and intersect with the major regional highways. 
Consequently, there is no need to use these roads to travel through the
village to reach other destinations within the metropolitan area.  These
minor arterials and other roadways within the village should be maintained
and improved for the purpose of traffic safety but not to increase capacity
or to encourage their use by through traffic.



   (B)   Because of the existing roadway pattern, there are no logical
roadway corridors within the village that are suitable for more intense
uses.  The three minor arterial roads and major collector all have rural
cross-sections.  Trees and ditches are located close to the pavements. 
This condition provides for pleasing, scenic views, but lowers the carrying
capacity of these roads.  The low land use intensities proposed for the
village are consistent with the low volumes and low capacities of the road
network.  The existing roadway system, therefore, is an important component
of, and thus contributes to, the rural quality the village seeks to maintain.



('80 Code, § 155.04) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)



§ 152.05  DENSITY PATTERN OF RESIDENTIAL LAND USE.



   (A)   In furtherance of its stated Charter objective of maintaining
its original rural character, the village adopted in 1983 specific land use
objectives and policies.  These adopted "Land Use Objectives and Policies"
(May 1983) are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this
plan.



   (B)   The village is not only a rural community, but also a
community of single-family residences.  As indicated in the land use map,
the land use pattern that will most effectively meet the village's adopted
"Land Use Objectives and Policies" is one which maintains the vast majority
of the community at a density of .2 dwelling units per acre (or five acres
per dwelling unit).  This planned density is identified as "rural estate" on
the land use map. The rural estate area runs along the eastern border of the
village and becomes broader as it goes north.  Along the western fork of
Sycamore Creek, the rural estate area is uninterrupted from the western to
eastern borders of the village.  The broader area thus serves to protect the
majority of the Sycamore Creek area that dominates the northern portion of
the village.  This density pattern, in conjunction with the implementation
of the village's adopted resource protection policies and careful attention
to landscape design, will insure the preservation of the village's rural
character as the dominant and unifying element of the village's land use plan.



   (C)   In addition, the plan shows a moderate area of one dwelling
unit per acre density which should be limited to the southwest area of the
village where it adjoins the City of Madeira, the City of Cincinnati,
Columbia Township, and the Village of Mariemont.  This density is identified
as "suburban estate" on the land use map.  North of the rural estate land
surrounding Sycamore Creek, two much smaller areas adjoining the City of
Montgomery near Perin Road and Spooky Ridge Lane are also designated for
suburban estate on the land use map.  Adjoining the suburban estate land
area in the southern part of the village should be an area of .3 dwelling
units per acre (three acres per dwelling unit).  This planned density is
identified as "estate" on the land use map.  The plan shows much smaller
areas of estate in the more rural northern portion of the village, again
generally surrounding the suburban estate, particularly along Blome and
Remington Roads.  The suburban estate and estate land areas represent a
logical transition in intensity of land use to communities to the west;
however, they cannot be significantly expanded without causing an adverse
effect upon the rural community character of the village.



('80 Code, § 155.05) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)



§ 152.06  OTHER LAND USES.



   The only nonresidential areas in the village are schools (public and
private), municipal buildings, churches, and recreational or cultural
facilities.  The introduction of commercial, office, or industrial uses into
the village would destroy its rural-residential character.  The surrounding
jurisdictions of Montgomery, Kenwood, Madeira, and Milford provide adequate
shopping and other commercial services for the needs of the residents of the
village and of the surrounding area.  The remoteness from congested
commercial centers is part of the rural living environment of the village. 
No commercial uses, except necessary public utility buildings needed to serve
the village residents, should be permitted.



('80 Code, § 155.06) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)



§ 152.07  REGIONAL LAND USE FUNCTION.



   Because the village from its inception has acted to maintain its rural
character, the suburban growth and sprawl in the Cincinnati metropolitan area
has leapfrogged over the village.  The rural enclave that the village has
preserved now serves an important regional function by preserving in open
space some of the rougher topographical areas of the region and enhancing the
character of the more densely settled surrounding communities.  By breaking
up the relatively uniform pattern of suburban development in the metropolitan
area, the village provides needed contrast in land use and open space, and
thereby contributes to the rural quality of neighboring communities and the
region.  Thus, these developed areas that surround the village are able to
"borrow" open space that has been preserved through the village's planning
policies.  Residents of the adjoining unincorporated residential areas to
the northeast who choose to drive through the village on their way to and
from work benefit from the perception that they live in a more rural
environment.  These benefits are obtained solely as the result of the
village's land use policies.



('80 Code, § 155.07) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)



§ 152.08  CONSISTENCY OF LAND USE DECISIONS WITH PLAN.



   The land use plan is adopted by resolution of the City Council. 
Together with the village's "Land Use Objectives and Policies" and the "Green
Areas Study", it is intended to provide a coherent land use planning
framework for the village's use in making land use decisions.  The land use
plan is advisory only.  However, by adoption of this plan, it is the City
Council's intent that the land use decision-making process shall include
careful consideration of the extent to which proposed land use changes are
consistent with the land use plan.  The City Planning Commission shall
consult the land use plan in determining whether or not to grant special
exceptions to the zoning code and in making its findings of fact and
recommendations to the City Council with respect to zoning amendments.  It
is also the intent of the City Council that the zoning code of the village,
and any amendment to it, shall not be inconsistent with the village's land
use plan.

§ 152.09  INTERPRETATION.



   Any question regarding the interpretation of this land use plan, as
well as its implementation, will be resolved by the City Council.

§ 153.03  PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS.



   (A)   The following principles are effective in minimizing erosion
and sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the control plan:



      (1)   Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other development
shall be done in such a way that will minimize erosion. Whenever feasible,
natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented;



      (2)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural
features, keep cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential;



      (3)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at
any one time and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical
minimum, the topsoil shall be preserved and returned to the surface of areas
to be revegetated;



      (4)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as
practicable with temporary vegetation or mulching to protect exposed critical
areas during development;



      (5)   The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion
control and drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development;



      (6)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development.  Where necessary, surface water runoff shall be
structurally retarded;



      (7)   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the
disturbed area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins,
silt traps, or similar measures.



   (B)   The following standards shall be followed in all soil erosion
and sediment control plans:



      (1)   All lots, tracts, or parcels shall be graded to provide
proper drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding, and
all land within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface
water without ponding, except where approved by the Planning Commission or
its duly authorized representative;



      (2)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to
adequately handle the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable
outlet such as a curbed street, storm drain, or natural watercourse.  Where

VARIATIONS



§ 154.045  GENERAL.



   Where the Planning Commission finds that undue hardship or exceptional
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these
regulations, the Planning Commission may grant variations to the regulations
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided, however, that such variations shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter or the zoning code.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



§ 154.046  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR VARIATIONS.



   The Planning Commission shall not grant variations to the regulations
of this chapter unless it shall make written findings of fact based upon the
evidence presented by each specific case that:



   (A)   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would cause undue hardship or
exceptional



practical difficulty to the applicant, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, or would conflict with the village's adopted land use plan, if
the provisions of this chapter were strictly enforced;



   (B)   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based
are unusual to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;



   (C)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to obtain additional income from the property;



   (D)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or general welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;



   (E)   The special circumstances or conditions are created by the
provisions or requirements of this chapter and have not resulted from any act
of the applicant or applicant's predecessor in interest; and



   (F)   The variation requested is the minimum adjustment necessary
for the reasonable use of the land.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



§ 154.047  STANDARDS FOR VARIATIONS INVOLVING MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS OF
NEIGHBORHOOD SIZE.



   Where a major subdivision large enough to constitute a self-contained
neighborhood is proposed with a comprehensive plan for the site and, in the
judgment of the Commission, such comprehensive plan makes adequate provisions
for essential community requirements and proposes reasonable modifications to
the standards of this chapter to accommodate the unusual size of the
subdivision, the Commission may grant variations to the regulations of this
chapter by making findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to it
which support written conclusions that:



   (A)   The conditions upon which the request for variation is based
are unusual to the property for which each variation is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;



   (B)   The purpose of the requested variation is not based
exclusively upon a desire to obtain additional income from or add value to
the property;



   (C)   The granting of the requested variation will not be
detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare or injurious to
other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is
located, nor conflict with the village's adopted land use plan;



   (D)   The special circumstances or conditions are created by the
provisions or requirements of this chapter and have not resulted from any act
of the applicant or applicant's predecessor in interest;



   (E)   Each variation requested is the minimum adjustment necessary
for the reasonable use of the land; and



   (F)   The variation requested will not conflict with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter.

conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of
the standards or requirements of these regulations.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



§ 154.049  PROCEDURES.

§ 154.061  PROCEDURE FOR RESUBDIVISION.



   For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if
such change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved
thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan
legally established prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling
subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the Planning Com-mission by

§ 154.062  PROCEDURE FOR SUBDIVISIONS WHERE FUTURE RESUBDIVISION IS
INDICATED.



   Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows
one or more lots containing greater than two times the minimum lot size for
the applicable zoning district and there are indications or the possibility
that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites,
the Planning Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the
future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. 
Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may
be made a requirement of the plat.

and approved by the City Engineer.  Such disbursements shall not be subject
to approval or disapproval by the owner/subdivider or escrowee or their
agents other than the owner/subdivider's engineer; however, for accounting
purposes, the village shall send to the owner/subdivider a copy of the
approved engineer's estimate for payment at time of village approval.  Each
payout order shall be accompanied by all appropriate sworn statements,
affidavits and supporting waivers of lien in full compliance with the Ohio
Mechanics Lien Law.



      (3)   Excess fund balance.  If, at any time, the City Manager
shall notify escrowee in writing that the balance of funds then remaining
undisbursed under said escrow account is more than sufficient to cover the
cost of construction fees and maintenance hereinabove provided, which said
notice shall specify the reduced balance then deemed sufficient, and if
escrowee shall concur in such determination, escrowee shall pay over to the
owner any excess of funds over such reduced balance then remaining
undisbursed under said escrow account.



   (B)   Letter of credit.  The owner/subdivider may file a straight,
commercial letter of credit from any financial institution acceptable to the
City Manager and the City Solicitor in a form acceptable to the City
Solicitor.  The letter of credit shall be in an amount, determined by the
City Manager, sufficient to pay for the cost of construction of the
improvements and all engineering costs, including the engineering and
inspection fees of the village.  The letter of credit must provide that the
issuing financial institution will pay to the village, or as the village
directs, such amounts as may be required to complete the improvements
according to the approved specifications.  The letter of credit should
provide that its amount will be reduced from time to time as payments for
improvements approved by the City Manager are made.  The letter of credit
shall be irrevocable for at least six months and must provide that if any
balance remains at the expiration of any time limit placed on it, said
balance will be deposited with the village in a cash escrow or a new letter
of credit in the amount of the unpaid balance will be issued or a surety bond
as prescribed in division (D) will be provided.



   (C)   Insufficient fund balance.  If, at any time before the
construction of all required improvements has been completed, the balance of
funds remaining undisbursed under said escrow account or letter of credit is
not sufficient, in the sole judgment of the City Manager, to cover the cost
of construction of said improvements and all engineering costs including the
engineering and inspection fees of the village, or if by reason of any order,
decree or writ of any court, or for any other reason, the said undisbursed
balance of funds shall be withheld, diminished or otherwise unavailable for
the purpose provided in this chapter, the owner/subdivider agrees to cause
the balance to be increased to such amount as shall be required by the
village for such purposes, in the exercise of its judgment, or shall provide
such other guarantee of performance as may be required by the village.



   (D)   Surety bond.



      (1)   Form.  The bond shall be in a form and with a bonding
company, and approved by the City Solicitor.



      (2)   Time limit.  The bond shall be payable to the City of
the Village of Indian Hill and be enforceable by same on or beyond a date 36
months from the date of final plat approval.



      (3)   Release of any bond required herein shall be conditioned
on final approval and acceptance of the improvements by the Planning
Commission.

§ 154.072  TIME LIMIT.



   All performance guarantees shall provide that if required improvements
are not installed within two years of approval of the final plat, the village
may deem the subdivider in default and proceed in accordance with the
provisions of § 154.073.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



§ 154.073  DEFAULT.



   In the event the City Manager determines, in the sole exercise of his
judgment, that the owner/ subdivider has failed to install the proposed
improvements in accordance with the approved plans and specifications or has
failed to comply with the terms of the guarantees hereinabove set forth, the
village may take the following actions:



   (A)   Cash escrow and letter of credit.  The village may advise the
owner/subdivider of failure in writing, giving the same 30 days to cure such
default. If the owner/subdivider fails to cure said default, it is agreed
that the village may, at its option, declare him in default and, upon written
notification to escrowee of such declaration of default, all monies on
deposit pursuant to the escrow agreement shall and may be disbursed by
escrowee solely upon authorization of the City Manager and escrowee shall be
released by the said owner/subdivider as to such payment or payments.



   (B)   Surety bond.  The village may inform the bonding company of
default by the owner and request they take necessary actions to complete the
required subdivision improvements.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



§ 154.074  GUARANTEE AMOUNT.



   The amount of the performance guarantee shall cover all construction
costs, the owner's engineering and platting costs, and the village's
engineering and inspection costs.  The guarantees shall be in the following
minimum amounts unless the owner can show that certain of the costs have
already been paid.



   (A)   Construction cost:



      (1)   130% of the estimated construction cost approved by the
City Manager; or



      (2)   110% of a binding contract with a contractor qualified
for the proposed work.



   (B)   Owner's engineering and platting cost:  at a cost verified by
the engineer and surveyor.



   (C)   Village Engineering and inspection costs:  actual costs
incurred.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)



§ 154.075  MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.



   The owner/subdivider shall guarantee public improvements required by
this  chapter against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of
two years from the date of acceptance of public improvements by the
village.  The owner/subdivider agrees to repair or replace any of said
public improvements which, during said two year period after acceptance,
shall become damaged or deficient due to defective materials or workmanship.



   (A)   Conditions of guarantee.  The owner/ subdivider shall
establish a cash escrow account or provide a letter of credit in the amount
of 5% of the final construction costs of the improvements to guarantee cost
of replacement of defective materials within the limits of the
improvements.  Said escrow account or letter of credit shall remain in force
for the aforesaid two year maintenance period and shall be for use by the
village to effect such repairs deemed necessary for public safety and which
the owner has neglected to repair for a 48 hour period after notification. 
Disbursements from the cash escrow account or pursuant to the letter of
credit shall be made solely upon the direction of the village and shall not
be subject to approval or disapproval by the owner/subdivider or escrowee or
the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or their agents.



   (B)   Return of funds.  Within 45 days following the two year
maintenance period, the escrowee or the financial institution issuing the
letter of credit shall pay over to the owner/subdivider, without further
demand or notice, any balance of funds then remaining undisbursed under said
letter of credit or escrow account.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



§ 154.076  DAMAGE AND NUISANCE GUARANTEE.



   The guarantee of completion of public improvements, to be executed
prior to recording of a final plat of subdivision, shall also provide for
repair of damages and abatement of nuisances with respect to existing and
subsequently installed landscaping, streets, lighting, water and sanitary
sewerage facilities, culverts, catch basins and/or storm sewers.  The damage
and nuisance guarantee herein referred to shall be in the total of 5% of the
construction cost of the new public improvements and shall be provided by
cash escrow agreement, letter of credit or surety bond as provided in §
154.070 through 154.078 upon commencement of land development.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)



§ 154.077  CONSTRUCTION CONTROL.



   (A)   Time of construction of improvements.  All public and private
improvements required pursuant to this chapter shall be installed after
approval of the final plat.  No work shall start prior to said approval.



   (B)   Time of construction of buildings.  No building permits shall
be issued for the construction of any building or structure unless a final
plat has been approved and recorded and unless all public improvements are
provided to serve the subdivision in the manner and in accordance with the
standards set forth in this chapter, provided, however, that permits may be
issued if all grading operations and drainage improvements are completed and
the base and intermediate layers of bituminous concrete have been placed on
the road or roads to be improved.



   (C)   Use of existing streets.  Only those streets designated by
the City Manager during the approval of the final plat may be used for access
to the subdivision by all equipment and trucks engaged in the construction of
all improvements, utility services and buildings.



   (D)   Sequence of construction.  All underground utilities, water
mains, sanitary sewers or storm sewers installed in streets or service roads
shall be installed prior to the surfacing of such streets.  Service
connections to such underground utilities and sewers shall be extended to the
property line of each lot so as to prevent disturbing the surface
improvements in such public ways when service connections are later made. 
Where underground utilities are located in the parkway adjacent to the paved
roadway, service connections to properties across such roads shall only be
made by drilling under the pavement in such a way that the surfacing is not
disturbed or weakened.



   (E)   Maintenance during construction.  The owner/subdivider shall
clean and maintain all public ways, sewers and drains free from snow, mud,
debris and trash or other extraneous material prior to acceptance of the
street by the village and at such other times during construction as the City
Manager or Village Engineer may deem necessary in accordance with Section
7.7.10 [sic] of the Village Code.



   (F)   (1)   Erosion, sedimentation measures and maintenance
requirements during construction.  Pursuant to Chapter 153, sediment basins,
diversions, sediment barriers, and other measures intended to trap sediment
on-site shall be constructed as a first step in grading and be made
functional before land disturbance takes place.



      (2)   Temporary stabilization of denuded areas, soil stock
piles and all other requirements of the approved Erosion and Sedimentation
Plan shall be in accordance with the design standards of the Hamilton County
Soil and Water Conservation District.

§ 154.078  INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.



   (A)   General.  Unless otherwise specifically provided, inspection
of the construction of the improvements shall be by the village and paid for
by the subdivider.



   (B)   (1)   Inspection required.  All required land improvements
to be installed under the provisions of this chapter shall be inspected at
the subdivider's expense.  The subdivider's licensed engineer, as agent for
the subdivider, shall provide an inspector on the job during the process of
construction.  When the work has been completed, the subdivider's engineer
shall certify that the improvements comply in all respects with the approved
plans and specifications and with the requirements of this chapter.  All
work shall be at all times subject to inspection by the City Manager, the
Village Engineer, other village officials, and their representatives.



      (2)   In the event the village elects to provide inspection of
subdivision construction, the cost of the village inspector shall be
determined in accordance with the current subdivision fee schedule. 
One-half of the cost of inspection shall be paid at the time of execution of
the final subdivision plat.  The remaining one-half of the inspection cost
is to be paid prior to the final release from the subdivider's guarantee of
improvement completion.  In the event the actual cost of engineering
services to the village shall exceed the amounts computed under the
subdivision fee schedule, such excess shall be paid by the subdivider to the
village upon final inspection for acceptance and release of subdivider's
completion guarantee.



   (C)   Notification.  Before starting the construction of any
improvements, the subdivider shall ascertain from the City Manager what
inspections are required and the amount of notification desired in each case.
In no event shall notice to the Village Engineer be less than 48 hours prior
to a desired inspection.



   (D)   Subdivider's responsibility.  Regardless of contracts,
agreements or inspections performed, final responsibility for the
installation of all improvements in accordance with the applicable standards
rests with the subdivider.



   (E)   Time limit on construction of public improvements.  All
improvements required under the provisions of this chapter shall be completed
within two years of approval of a final plat or the subdivider shall be
considered in default under the provisions of § 154.073.

ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS; RELEASE OF PERFORMANCE SURETY



§ 154.085  ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.



   If any plat of subdivision contains public streets or easements which
are dedicated thereon as such, whether located within the corporate limits of
the village or in part outside thereof, or contains existing streets located
outside of the corporate limits, approval of the final plat by the Planning
Commission, approval of payouts under the terms of a guarantee of
improvement, or subsequent annexation of the property to the village shall
not constitute an acceptance by the village of such streets or easements, nor
of the public improvements constructed or installed thereon or therein,
irrespective of any act by any officer, agent or employee of the village with
respect to such streets or improvements.  The acceptance of all public
improvements shall be made only by the adoption of an ordinance by the
Village Council after there has been filed with the Council a certification
by the City Manager stating that all, or individual, public improvements
required to be constructed or installed have been fully, or individually,
completed, and that the construction or installation has been approved by him.

§ 154.086  SUBMISSION OF "AS BUILT" DRAWINGS.



   After completion of all public improvements and prior to final
acceptance of said improvements, the subdivider shall make or cause to be
made "as built" drawings showing the actual location of all improvements. 
The plan shall be in black ink on mylar or materials of equal permanence and
durability and shall bear the seal and signature of the subdivider's
engineer. The plans consisting of the original drawings and three sets of
blue line prints shall be submitted to the village for permanent record.
Presentation of the plans to the village shall be a condition of final
acceptance of the subdivision improvements.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



§ 154.087  RELEASE OF PERFORMANCE SURETY.



   No street or roadway shall be accepted by the village for dedication
until 75% of all lots in the subdivision in which said street is located
shall have been fully improved with buildings authorized thereon and a
certificate of occupancy has been issued, and surface course of a street or
thoroughfare, shall be collectively considered as a single, or individual
improvement and such construction shall constitute release of the applicable
portion of the performance surety.  No street or roadway shall be accepted
by the village during the months of November, December, January, February,
March and April unless otherwise determined by the City Manager.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)



SUBDIVISION STANDARDS



§ 154.095  GENERAL.



   All subdivisions in the village shall comply with the minimum standards
set forth in this chapter, the zoning code and all other applicable
regulations of the village. All land improvements proposed in a subdivision,
including building areas of lots, streets, storm drainage, public utilities,
sewers, site grading, and the like shall be constructed within the clearable
land area calculated pursuant to § 154.110 through 154.116 and the appendix
to this chapter.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)



§ 154.096  LOT STANDARDS.



   (A)   Lot dimensions; area and setbacks.  Lot dimensions, area, and
set backs shall comply with the requirements of the zoning code of the
village, as amended from time to time, for the zoning district in which the
property is situated.  Lots shall not block any street extensions which have
been set forth on the official (street) map of the village.



   (B)   Lot abutment.



      (1)   Every lot of a subdivision shall abut on a
publicly-dedicated street or a private street, provided, however, that the
Planning Commission may approve a subdivision, the lots of which do not abut
on a publicly-dedicated street or a private street ("rear lots") if:



         (a)   The rear lot or lots abut on a lot, which in turn
abuts on:



            1.   An existing public street; or



            2.   A private street which complies with §
154.097 (B) and (E), or an existing private street which is determined by the
Planning Commission to be of such construction and width and has such other
characteristics as satisfy the purposes of this section;



         (b)   The rear lot or lots are served by an unobstructed
easement not less than 40 feet in width which connects such rear lot or lots
with the existing public or private street described in division (B)(1)
above; and



         (c)   The rear lots permit more efficient lotting and
avoid the construction of a street in an environmentally sensitive area.



      (2)   Rear lots shall not be approved if the Planning
Commission shall determine that their primary purpose is to avoid the
construction of a public street, that such lots would create a safety hazard,
or that such lots would be inconsistent with the village's adopted land use
objectives and policies.



   (C)   Double-frontage lots.  Double-frontage lots and
reversed-frontage lots are not permitted, except in such instances where such
a lot arrangement will avoid the construction of lots that face on principal
or secondary streets.



   (D)   Side lot lines.  Side lot lines shall be approximately at
right angles or radial to the right-of-way line of the street on which the
lot faces.



   (E)   Corner lots.  In order to permit conformance with the front
yard depth on the side street required by the zoning ordinance, a corner lot
shall be platted 50 feet wider than the minimum frontage required for
interior lots by the applicable zoning district.



   (F)   Remnant parcels.  No remnants of property shall be left which
do not conform to all lot requirements, unless such remnant parcels are
accepted by the village for public purposes.



(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)



§ 154.097  STREETS.



   (A)   General.  All improvements required by this section shall be
constructed in accordance with the following general standards.



      (1)   Convenient access to all property within a subdivision
shall be afforded by either a dedicated public street or a private street. 
Private streets will be considered by the Planning Commission depending on
site suitability, provided that a binding agreement contained in the plat or
other recorded or registered document shall assure the continued existence
and maintenance of said street or access.



      (2)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment or
continuation of existing streets already named shall bear the name of such
existing streets whether in the village or in unincorporated areas.  In no
case shall the names for proposed streets duplicate existing street names,
irrespective of the use of a suffix (such as street, road, boulevard, drive,
place or court, and the like) or an abbreviation thereof.  Street names
shall be approved by the Planning Commission which shall keep a list of all
street names in the village.



      (3)   No permanent building or structure or permanent
improvement of any type shall be erected within the extension of street
rights-of-way indicated on the official [street] map of the village.



      (4)   As far as practicable, all proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.



      (5)   Proposed rights-of-way for streets shall be extended to
the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the
Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination
of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout, or the most
advantageous future development, of adjacent tracts. Cul-de-sac streets of
reasonable length will be approved where necessitated by topography or where,
in the opinion of the Commission, they are appropriate for the type of
development contemplated.



      (6)   Proposed streets shall follow contour lines wherever
practicable.



      (7)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly
at right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design
permits and where sight distance is sufficient for traffic safety.



      (8)   Whenever there exits adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided a dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street or service
drive, the other half width of such street or service drive shall be platted.



      (9)   In the rear of lots fronting on principal village
streets, where practicable, provision shall be made for service drives when
required by the Commission.



   (B)   Right-of-way and pavement widths.



      (1)   The minimum width of a right-of-way of and minimum

Min. Cul-de-sac radius         60          20



      (2)   When any subdivision or part of a subdivision is
adjacent to only one side of an existing right-of-way, which is less than the
required width, the subdivider shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet
the requirement in accordance with this regulation.  Half -streets in new
subdivisions are not permitted.  A planted or landscaped area shall be
provided in the center of the turning circle of cul-de-sacs.



   (C)   Block standards.  Block lengths and widths shall be
coordinated with the development of the land and shall be designed in a
manner that will allow proper traffic flow, including fire fighting equipment
and pedestrian use, and pedestrian accessways within the blocks to schools,
parks or other destinations as may be required by the Planning Commission. 
In addition, blocks shall be designed in conformance with the following
requirements:



      (1)   Blocks shall be of sufficient width to provide for two
tiers of lots of appropriate length.



      (2)   The lengths of blocks shall be such as, in the opinion
of the Commission, are appropriate for the locality and the type of
development contemplated.



      (3)   The number of intersecting streets along principal
village streets shall be held to a minimum.



   (D)   Public street design standards.



      (1)   (a)   Street grades and curves for public streets
shall conform to the following standards:

Minor   12.0%   0.5%   100



  Street



         (b)   All changes in street grades shall be 41.55
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equal to 15 times the
algebraic dif-ference in the rate of grade, for principal village streets,
and one-half of this minimum for all other streets.  A tangent at least 100
feet in length shall be provided between reversed curves.  In areas of
sensitive natural resources, the horizontal alignment of minor streets may be
varied by the Planning Commission to avoid the destruction of mature trees or
other important natural features.



      (2)   Intersections shall conform to the following standards:



         (a)   At street intersections property line corners
shall be rounded by an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be ten feet.



         (b)   Street curb or street pavement intersections shall
be rounded by radii of at least 25 feet.



         (c)   The above minimum radii shall be increased when
the smallest angle of intersection is less than 60 degrees, or in any case
where the Commission considers an increase necessary.



      (3)   Street pavement design and all street appurtenances
shall comply with § 154.037 (B)(7) of the Village of Indian Hill Standard
Construction Drawings and/or the latest edition of the State of Ohio
Department of Transportation Construction and Material Specifications.



   (E)   Special private street standards.  If private minor streets
are approved by the Planning Commission, the street shall comply with the
applicable design standards in division (D) of this section and any
exceptions shown in the village standard construction drawings.



   (F)   Trees and plants.  Trees and plants shall be provided in
accordance with the requirements of § 154.150 through 154.154.



   (G)   Signs.  Street name signs will be erected by the village at
all intersections created by the development.  Customized or specially
designed street signs may be erected by the developer in lieu of village
signs, provided that the sign face material and design are in accordance with
current village standards and are approved by the village. Ornamental
entranceway structures, as permitted by § 155.08 of the zoning code, may be
erected at street entrances. Such entranceways, however, shall not include
the name of the subdivision.



   (H)   Special soil regulations for streets.



      (1)   Organic soils. If during the construction of proposed
streets or roads in a subdivision organic soils are discovered, all organic
materials shall be removed to solid subsoil in the area of the proposed
street or road and replaced with fill materials that allow movement of ground
water in its natural state through the fill and provides the required
structural support for the roadway.  All such streets shall be elevated
above the expected high water in the area, as determined by the soils summary
pursuant to § 154.036 (B)(6), so as to provide a minimum of two feet between
the pavement surface and the water.  In no instance shall the pavement base
course be constructed within six inches of the expected high water.



      (2)   Wet soils.  If the construction of proposed streets and
roads in a subdivision is to go through wet soils, positive ground water
control must be achieved.  The surface of all roads shall be constructed at
an elevation so as to provide a minimum of two feet between the pavement
surface and expected high ground water or free water surface.  In no
instance shall the pavement base course be constructed within six inches of
expected high water, as determined by a report certified by the subdivider's
engineer.  All designs shall insure that natural drainage is maintained. 
In no instance shall movement of ground water be impeded so as to promote
build-up of hydrostatic pressure on one side or the other of a proposed
roadway.

§ 154.098  STORM DRAINAGE.



   (A)   Design storm criteria.  All storm runoff shall be calculated
by means of such methods as are approved in advance by the Village Engineer.
Drainage structures shall be designed to accommodate the 100 year storm of
one hour duration.  The Village Engineer may recommend a lesser standard
where a computer simulation indicates that the lesser standard would improve
an existing flooding problem.



   (B)   Ditches.  Ditches shall be designed and constructed as needed
on both sides of the roadway outside of the shoulder line.  Ditches, where
required, shall have maximum slopes of four to one (4:1) on the roadway side
and two to one (2:1) on the property side.  Maximum ditch gradient without
erosion protection shall be 2%.  If a ditch gradient exceeds 2%, the ditch
shall be protected from erosion by means of sodding, ditch checks, storm
sewers or combinations thereof as deemed necessary by the Village Engineer.
Other creative means of erosion control will be considered on an individual
basis.  Minimum ditch gradient shall be 0.3%.  If this gradient cannot be
maintained, storm sewers shall be installed.



   (C)   Culverts. 



      (1)   Minimum culvert sizes shall be 12 inches for driveways
and 15 inches for roadway crossings.  At locations where culverts cross
roadways, a minimum depth of six inches will be maintained between the top of
the pipe and the finished roadway subgrade.



      (2)   All roadway culverts shall be fitted with end sections
or headwalls and shall extend a sufficient distance beyond the shoulder line
to fit the roadway side backslope.



      (3)   Special consideration shall be given to the end
treatment for all culverts 36 inches in diameter and larger to assure
compatibility with the surrounding environment.



      (4)   Prior to acceptance of the street improvement or the
issuance of any building permits, the subdivider shall furnish the village an
overall map of the subdivision showing the proper size culvert for each lot
as determined from hydraulic calculations.



   (D)   Detention basins.  All natural detention basins will be
maintained within a development and their area specifically preserved for
that use.  Any required artificial basins shall be developed to provide a
natural-appearing site to include planting of trees and bushes.  All
restoration shall be in accordance with § 154.130 through 154.134.



   (E)   Positive drainage.  All areas of the subdivision shall be
designed so as to provide positive drainage by means of existing or newly
constructed swales.  Streets may be used for drainage only where there is no
other means of conveying storm water.



   (F)   Drainage calculations.  The developer's engineer shall
provide the Village Engineer with copies of all calculations required to
design the storm drainage system for the proposed subdivision.  The
computations shall include data for the entire area tributary to the
development.  Special consideration shall be given to avoiding problems
which might arise from storm water runoff onto adjacent properties.

   (A)   Telephone, electric, gas, water, and cable T.V. service
lines.  All telephone, electric, gas, water and cable service lines shall be
placed underground throughout the entire subdivision area.  All conduits or
cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner
which will not conflict with other underground service.  All such telephone,
electric, gas, water and cable service lines shall be located and constructed
to minimize or eliminate flood damage.  Above-ground structures identified
with said underground service facilities shall be located so as not to be
unsightly or hazardous to the public and shall be landscaped.



   (B)   Water service.  Installation of water service mains shall
conform to the provisions of Chapter 52 (Water Works).



   (C)   Utility easements.  Utility easements of not less than ten
feet in width shall be dedicated where necessary to provide a proper
continuity for such utilities from lot to lot and from block to block.  No
structures shall be constructed upon the easements. Additional easements
shall be provided for utilities, drainage an other public services and
requirements in order to provide proper operation and maintenance of said
facilities.

§ 154.116  PRESERVATION OF RESOURCE PROTECTION AREAS.



   (A)   Designation and use.  Resource protection areas that are
identified pursuant to § 154.113, 154.114, and 154.115 shall be designated
on the final plat of subdivision as such and in no case shall designated
resource protection areas be developed.  Land which is designated as a
resource protection area pursuant to this section shall be used for resource
protection and such other purposes as the Planning Commission shall approve
and authorize to be designated on the final plat, subject to such conditions
as the Commission may deem appropriate.  Access to land designated strictly
for resource protection shall be restricted in order to ensure such
protection.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no area occupied
by structures, roads, road rights-of-way or parking areas shall be counted as
designated resource protection areas.



   (B)   Methods of preservation.  Resource protection areas shall be
designated so their use and enjoyment as natural areas is not obstructed. 
The form of ownership of resource protection areas shall be designated on the
final plat.  Resource protection areas shall be owned and preserved by
either of the following two methods or a combination thereof:



      (1)   Conveyance of the resource protection areas to the
village as trustee of and under the Green Areas and Recreational Fund
pursuant to § 155.08(F) for which the developer may qualify for a credit on
the clearable land area pursuant to the appendix to this chapter, and/or a
special exception to required minimum lot sizes pursuant to § 155.08; or



      (2)   Deed restricted private ownership which shall prohibit
in perpetuity the development and/or subsequent subdivision of the resource
protection areas or their use for purposes other than those specified in §
154.116.  The responsibility and standards for all resource protection areas
shall be specified and provision shall be made for guaranteeing such
responsibility.



   (C)   Clearable land area.  The acreage of clearable land
identified in the appendix to this chapter may be combined with resource
protection areas, minus the public or private street rights-of-way, for the
purpose of calculating the number of lots permitted on a parcel under the
applicable district regulations pursuant to § 155.07, provided, however,
that the combined total acreage of all areas clearable for development on the
parcel shall not exceed the clearable land area as calculated pursuant to the
appendix to this chapter.



   (D)   Procedures required for on-site improvements.  Prior to
commencing improvements on a site on which resource protection areas have
been designated pursuant to § 154.113, 154.114, and 154.115, the
owner/subdivider shall stake off and install a barrier fence along the
designated resource protection areas. Any owner/subdivider who fails to
comply with this provision prior to commencement of improvements on the site,
or fails to maintain fenced off areas on the site during such improvements,
shall be subject to a fine pursuant to the provisions of § 154.999 for each
day on which improvements were performed in violation of this section.  An
owner/subdivider found guilty of such a violation, which has also resulted in
the destruction of designated resource protection areas, shall, in addition,
be liable for the costs of restoring such resource protection areas to their
natural condition.

exception to the district regulations of the zoning ordinance for PWS
facilities.  Consistent with the village's use objectives and policies, it
is preferred that all applicants desiring to establish PWS facilities within
the village utilize existing towers or existing support structures, as those
terms are defined in § 156.03.  The standards set forth below shall be
considered in addition to the general special exception standards in §
155.08 and 155.10(E) of the zoning ordinance.  Where the standards and/or
requirements of this chapter conflict with the provisions of the zoning
ordinance, the specific requirements of this chapter shall control.



   (B)   Use regulations.



      (1)   PWS facilities shall be permitted by special exception
in the thoroughfare proximity areas located in zoning districts A, B, and C.



      (2)   PWS facilities may be permitted in areas outside
thoroughfare proximity areas if the Commission, following review and approval
of an application for special exception, determines that no feasible
alternative site exists in the thoroughfare proximity area which will
substantially satisfy the PWS providers' coverage and service needs.



   (C)   General procedure: preapplication conference.  An application
for a special exception to develop a PWS facility shall comply with the
hearing requirements and procedures set forth in § 155.10 of the zoning
ordinance.  In addition, an applicant proposing the establishment of a PWS
facility is encouraged to schedule a preapplication conference with the City
Manager to discuss the nature and proposed location of the PWS facility. 
The preapplication conference is intended to facilitate the filing and
consideration of a complete application, and no representation made by the
City Manager or any other village official during the preapplication
conference shall be binding upon the village with respect to the application
subsequently submitted.



   (D)   Application requirements.  Any person owning property in the
village or having an interest in property together with a PWS provider may
file an application with the City Manager for a special exception to
establish a PWS facility.  An application for a variance from the provisions
and requirements of this chapter may be filed as specified in § 155.10(E) of
the zoning ordinance in conjunction with the application for a special
exception.  Such variance application shall be considered by the Planning
Commission at the same public hearing at which it considers the application
for special exception.  However, a decision by the Planning Commission to
grant the requested variance shall be made only after first deciding the
application for special exception.



      (1)   Application for PWS facility requiring a new tower.  In

search methodology specific to the provision of personal wireless service to
the village.



            2.   Consistent with the provisions of § 155.10
of the zoning ordinance, as a condition of approval of a special exception,
the PWS provider shall have a continuing obligation to update and revise this
report.  Such revisions and updates shall be submitted with each subsequent
application for the establishment of a PWS Facility or upon the request of
the Commission.

         (k)   Such additional information as the Commission may,
in its sole discretion, require.



      (3)   The Commission may, upon the request of the applicant,
waive the submission of any of the information required by division (D)(2) of
this section if, in its sole discretion, the Commission believes the
information is not necessary to make its decision on the special exception
application for the co-location on a previously approved PWS facility, on an
existing tower, or on an existing support structure.



   (E)   Standards for approval of a PWS facility.  The Commission
shall not grant a special exception for a PWS facility unless the applicant
has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence in the record that it has
complied with the standards set forth below.  In each case, the Commission
shall make written findings of fact and conclusions directly based on and
supported by the record presented to it in the application and at the hearing.



      (1)   For a PWS facility for co-location or for a PWS facility
on an existing tower or on an existing support structure, the Commission must
find that the application complies with the following standards.



         (a)   The applicant has complied with the special
exception standards set forth in § 155.08 and 155.10 of the zoning ordinance.



         (b)   The applicant has complied with the submission
requirements of § 156.04(D)(2) above;

         (d)   The PWS facility is in compliance with all
applicable requirements of the zoning ordinance;



         (e)   All antennas mounted on or within an existing
support structure are adequately screened, painted, and/or architecturally
treated so as to blend into the proposed or existing architectural character
of the structure.  To the extent possible, equipment associated with PWS
facilities on existing support structures shall be located within the support
structure. If a new equipment shelter is included as a part of a PWS
facility, it shall have an appearance consistent with other buildings or
structures on the parcel and will preserve the character of the village as a
rural neighborhood of homes, green open spaces, and farms;



         (f)   The PWS facility use will not substantially
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;



         (g)   The PWS facility use will have adequate access to
utilities and public roads and shall provide adequate space for on-site
parking.



         (h)   All exterior lighting fixtures will be designed,
directed, or shaded so that no direct light is cast upon any other property;



         (i)   The PWS facility use and its associated uses and
structures are adequately landscaped in a manner consistent with the
principle and accessory use of the site and the provisions of the land use
objectives and policies.



         (j)   The PWS facility complies with the RF emission
standards adopted by the FCC.



         (k)   The PWS facility complies with the performance
standards set forth in § 156.04(F).



      (2)   A proposed PWS facility which will require the
construction of a new tower shall comply with the standards set forth in §
156.04(D)(1) above and the following additional standards.



         (a)   The area proposed to be serviced by the PWS
facility cannot be adequately addressed by the establishment of a PWS
facility on an existing tower or an existing support structure.



         (b)   The use of an existing tower is not technically,
structurally, economically, and/or financially feasible.



         (c)   The proposed facility has adequate capacity to
handle a maximum of three additional users.



         (d)   No federal or state government land is available
for the siting of the proposed PWS facility.



         (e)   All towers shall maintain a galvanized finish or
shall be painted a neutral color, consistent with the natural or built
environment of the site.



         (f)   All obstruction lighting and/or marking required
by the FAA shall be approved by the Commission at the time the application is
made.



         (g)   Ground anchors associated with any guyed towers
shall be located on the same parcel as the tower and shall satisfy the
setback requirements for structures in that district.



   (3)   The Commission at its discretion, may retain an outside
consultant to assist it in its evaluation of the special exception
application for a PWS facility.  The cost for such consulting services shall
be borne by the applicant and shall be collected as a part of the application
fee.  The applicant shall not be entitled to a return of this fee if the
application is denied.



   (F)   Thoroughfare proximity areas performance standards.  For the
purpose of this chapter only, a location proposed for a PWS facility which
satisfies all of the following standards shall be deemed to be within the
limits of the thoroughfare proximity areas:



      (1)   The proposed PWS facility shall be no closer than 250
feet nor further than 1,500 feet from the closest right-of-way line
associated with any principal street in the village.



      (2)   The proposed PWS Facility site must be located in an
area which maintains a ground elevation of at least 650 feet above mean sea
level (AMSL).



      (3)   No portion of the proposed PWS facility site compound is
within 250 feet from any existing single family residential structure on the
same parcel or adjacent parcels.



      (4)   Any tower associated with the proposed PWS facility
shall satisfy the setback requirement of § 156.06(E).



   (G)   Presumption favoring thoroughfare proximity areas.  It is
presumed, for the purposes of this chapter, that PWS facilities in the
village can be located in the established thoroughfare proximity areas.  The
Com-mission may approve a special exception application for a PWS facility in
an area outside of the thorough-fare proximity areas if, in addition to
satisfying the standards set forth in division (E) of this section, the
applicant can demonstrate that absolutely no site location within the
thoroughfare proximity areas can satisfy its technical coverage needs.  The
Commission may require the submission of such additional information as it
deems necessary to determine that no site in the thoroughfare proximity areas
exists that will satisfy the reasonable coverage needs of the PWS provider.



The PWS provider's inability to agree on acceptable terms with a property
owner for the use of his/her parcel shall not, in and of itself, be an
acceptable reason for failing to propose a PWS facility on a parcel within
the thoroughfare proximity areas.



(Ord. 12-97, passed 7-14-97)



§ 156.05  CO-LOCATION.



   (A)   In an effort to avoid the proliferation of PWS facilities in
the village, the village has established, as a part of its land use
objectives and policies, a clear policy in favor of co-location.  Each tower
proposed as a part of a PWS facility shall be required to accommodate a
maximum of three additional personal wireless service providers and shall
make space available on the tower to federal, state, and local emergency
service providers as requested.



   (B)   Following the issuance of an approval of a special exception
for a PWS facility, and prior to the issuance of a building permit for the
construction of a tower, the applicant shall enter into a written agreement
with the village committing to make the approved tower available to
additional users.  The willful and knowing misrepresentation and the
subsequent failure of the applicant to construct the tower and act in
accordance with the approval, the signed co-location agreement, and the
village's co-location policy is unlawful and shall, among other remedies of
the village, including the revocation of the special exception permit, be
cause for the withholding of future permits for similar facilities and PWS
facilities within the village.  The applicant shall agree to make its tower
available to other PWS providers on reasonable terms and conditions.



   (C)   A PWS provider who is denied access to a PWS facility tower
previously approved under this chapter may petition the Commission to review
its request to use the existing PWS facility tower.  The Commission may hold
a hearing, at which all parties shall appear, to determine whether the
requested co-location is technically, legally, and economically feasible and
to determine if the permittee is in breach of its agreement with the village
to permit such co-location.  Upon finding that co-location on an existing
PWS facility tower is technically, legally, and economically feasible and/or
upon a finding that the permittee is in breach of its co-location agreement,
the Commission may act in accordance with the remedies set forth in division
(B) of this section.  All costs associated with the Commission's review and
mediation of co-location disputes shall be shared equally by the petitioner
and the permittee.



(Ord. 12-97, passed 7-14-97)



§ 156.06  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Parking.  A maximum of two parking spaces may be provided at
a PWS facility.



   (B)   Landscaping.



      (1)   Each site approved for use as a PWS facility shall be
suitably landscaped.  It is the intent of these landscape provisions to
establish visual screening of all structures or equipment associated with the
facility and located within the site compound.  This landscaped area shall
consist of a minimum ten-foot wide landscaped strip around the entire site
compound for new tower sites or landscaping consistent with the principal use
of the site for PWS facilities utilizing existing support structures.  At
the discretion of the Commission, this landscape requirement may be waived
for PWS facilities on existing support structures.



      (2)   The applicant shall propose a mix of tree, shrubs, and
ground cover to provide adequate screening of all structures and equipment
within the site compound, excluding any tower structure but including any
fence or wall surrounding the site compound.  Landscaping requirement may be
varied at the discretion of the Commission as site specific conditions
dictate.



   (C)   Maintenance and removal.



      (1)   The owner/operator of an approved PWS facility shall be
responsible for the maintenance of the site compound, associated landscaping,
access driveway, and any associated areas of the property used as a part of
the PWS facility.



      (2)   Any PWS facility tower which has discontinued its
service as authorized by special exception for a period of 12 continuous
months shall be dismantled and removed from the site at the owner's
expense.  The Commission shall provide the PWS facility operator with notice
to remove the tower within 90 days after receipt of such notice.  For the
purpose of this section, a tower shall be deemed to have discontinued its
service as authorized by special exception if it has been abandoned, becomes
obsolete, or ceased to be used or operated on a daily basis.



      (3)   As a condition of the Commission's approval of a PWS
facility tower, the owner of the property upon which the PWS facility tower
is located shall be required to submit to the Commission the owner's covenant
to undertake the responsibility and cost for the removal of a PWS facility
tower, which covenant shall be made enforceable by the village and recorded
as a lien against the property.  This lien shall be released after tower
removal and final inspection and sign off by the City Manager or its designee.



   (D)   Fences and walls.  Each PWS facility requiring the
construction of a new tower shall be surrounded by an eight-foot high
fence/wall and gate adequate to provide vehicular access to the base of the
tower and the equipment shelter.  The type, style, and the material of the
proposed fence/wall shall be approved by the Commission as a part of the
special exception application process.  The fence/wall shall be installed
along the perimeter of the site compound. The Commission may in its sole
discretion impose these fence/wall requirements on PWS facilities utilizing
existing support structures.



   (E)   Setbacks.  Towers associated with a PWS facility shall be set
back from all property lines a distance equal to the height of the tower. 
All other structures or equipment associated with a PWS facility must comply
with the appropriate setback requirements of the zoning ordinance.



   (F)   Tower height.  No tower shall exceed 160 feet in height. 
However, the Commission may approve a special exception for a new tower whose
proposed height exceeds 160 feet upon making written findings of fact and
conclusions that the additional height allowed will further the village's
policy to encourage co-location of PWS facilities.



   (G)   Modifications.  Any modification to PWS facility approved
under this chapter shall require the submission of a new special exception
application in accordance with the provisions and requirements of §
156.04.  The Commission may agree to waive certain submission requirements
if, at its discretion, the Commission believes such a waiver is justified.



   (H)   Prohibitions.  No PWS facility shall be located in any
village green areas, as designated on the green areas map on file in the City
Manager's office.  In addition, no PWS facility tower shall be illuminated
in any manner unless such illumination is required by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).



   (L)   Transferability.  Special exception approvals for the
development and operation of PWS facilities may be transferred only after the
Commission's receipt, at least 60 days prior to the transfer, of the notice
of the applicant's intent to transfer and upon review and approval of the
Commission at their next regularly scheduled meeting following receipt of the
transfer notice.

required set back for the districts in which the applicant's lot is located, whichever is the greater distance.
If the applicant desires to locate such proposed residence at any other location the applicant shall make an application to the
Planning Commission to otherwise locate such proposed residence. Upon such application and in order to assure orderly
development of the land and provide for the health and safety of the community the Planning Commission shall take into
consideration all relevant factors bearing upon the proper location of such proposed residence including, but not limited to,
the location of existing residences, the date and time such residences were created, the conformity to the front yard
requirements of the area in which the lot is located, the terrain of adjoining lots and locations of buildings thereon, the
character and other features of applicant's proposed residence, and probable locations of other proposed residences on the
same side of the street and any undue hardship which may result from requiring the front yard depth to be as above provided.
If the application to otherwise locate such proposed residence is denied such residence shall be located as above provided in
the first paragraph of this Section 83.1.
83.11 Replacement Residences. As long as the existing front yard setback meets or exceeds the minimum front yard
setback for the district in which the applicant’s lot is located, the provisions set forth in Section 83.1 shall not apply in the
case of an application to replace an existing residence with a new residence located at the same front yard setback as the

"The Green Areas and Recreational Fund of Indian Hill", as promulgated by Ordinance No. 21-62, the Planning Commission may
grant a special exception in accordance with the provisions of Section 101.4 to permit lot sizes of three (3) acres or more provided no
greater number of dwellings shall be allowed than would be allowed under Section 63.1 for the entire lot if developed under Section
63.1 without benefit of this Section 86, and provided, further, that all other requirements for District "A" set forth in this Ordinance
and in the Subdivision Regulations (Ordinance No. 19-45, as amended) shall be complied with.
In the case of a development for dwellings on a lot or parcel of land in District "B" when the owner or developer conveys or agrees to
convey one-third (1/3rd) or less of said lot or parcel to Indian Hill as Trustee of and under "The Green Areas and Recreational Fund of
Indian Hill" as promulgated by Ordinance No. 21-62, the Planning Commission may grant a special exception in accordance with the
provisions of Section 101.4 to permit lot sizes of two (2) acres or more provided no greater number of dwellings shall be allowed than
would be allowed under Section 63.1 for the entire lot if developed under Section 63.1 without benefit of this Section 86, and
provided, further, that all other requirements for District "B" set forth in this Ordinance and in the Subdivision Regulations (Ordinance
No. 19-45, as amended) shall be complied with.
In applying the foregoing principles to a subdivision, the Planning Commission may approve a division of all the land in the
subdivision so that of the total of the land of a subdivision lying in District "A", up to forty (40%) percent of that land may be
conveyed to the Village of Indian Hill as Trustee of "The Green Areas and Recreational Fund of Indian Hill"; and of the total of the
land of a subdivision lying in District "B", up to thirty-three and one-third (33-1/3%) percent of that land may be conveyed to the
Village of Indian Hill as Trustee of "The Green Areas and Recreational Fund of Indian Hill". Of the remaining land, there shall be no
greater number of lots than would otherwise be permitted on that land were it not for the gift of land for Green Areas. All lots of that
subdivision shall have a minimum size of three (3) acres in District "A", or two (2) acres in District "B". All the lots shall conform to
the lot lines and set back requirements of the respective districts. Gifts to the Green Areas Fund shall be contiguous to the subdivision
and within the Village of Indian Hill. Approval shall be in compliance with Section 32 of Ordinance No. 19-45.
In carrying out and administering the foregoing, the Planning Commission may give such other permissions or attach such other
conditions as may be desirable or necessary in its discretion to preserve the character of the neighborhood in which the use of this
ordinance is sought to promote the Purposes of the Charter of this ordinance. In the opinion of Council, this Ordinance is more useful
to effectuate the open space and green area policies of Indian Hill when large lots or parcels of land are involved and particularly in
areas adjacent to open spaces and green areas already in the public land of Indian Hill.

if for an accessory structure. The lot and the location of the proposed structure thereon shall be staked out on the ground before
excavation or construction is started.
One copy of such plans shall be retained by the City Manager and one copy returned to the applicant when such plans shall have been
approved by him, together with such site clearance as may be granted.

continues shall constitute a separate offense.
96. Remedies - In case any structure is or is intended to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, moved or
maintained, or any structure or land is or is intended to be used, in violation of the provisions of this ordinance, the City Solicitor, in
addition to the remedies provided for in the Statutes of the State of Ohio and this ordinance, is hereby authorized to institute an
appropriate action or proceeding in law or equity to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alterations,
conversion, moving, maintenance or use, or to restrain, correct or abate such violation.

below, shall have the power to grant special exceptions to the district regulations of this ordinance. Special
exceptions are uses which are generally compatible with the other land uses permitted in a given zoning district, but
which, because of their potential adverse impact on the use and enjoyment of nearby properties, require individual
review of their location, site design, and/or operation, and the imposition of such conditions as the Commission may
deem necessary in order to minimize potential adverse impacts of the particular exception and to ensure that the
exception is consistent with the character of the neighborhood.
101.42 Special Exceptions Authorized
101.421 Only the uses identified in this Section shall be allowed as special exceptions, provided that they
meet the standards established in this Section 101.43. Except as otherwise stated below, the following uses

the Commission, is of the same or less objectionable nature in respect to its effect on the neighborhood,
provided no structural alterations, except as are required by law or ordinance, are made in any structure.
(11) The extension of a non-conforming use of land or non-conforming use throughout a structure
manifestly designed for such use, provided no structural alteration, except such as are required by law or
ordinance, are made therein.
(12) The temporary use of a structure or of land in any district for a purpose or use which does not
conform to the regulations prescribed by this ordinance for the district in which it is located, provided that
such use be of a true temporary nature and does not involve the erection of substantial structures. A permit
for such temporary use shall be revocable and for not more than a period of twelve (12) months, subject to
such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, morals and general
welfare.
(13) The special exception hereinbefore specified in Section 86.
101.422 The listing or designation of a special exception above does not constitute an assurance or
presumption that such special exception will be approved. Rather, each proposed special exception shall be
evaluated by the Commission on an individual basis, in relation to its compliance with the standards and
conditions set forth in this Section and with the standards for the district in which it is located, in order to
determine whether approval of the special exception is appropriate at the particular location and in the
particular manner proposed.

101.5 Variances
101.51 Purpose - The Commission, upon application, shall have the power to grant variances from the provisions
and requirements of this ordinance which will not be contrary to the public interest or the general purpose and intent
of this ordinance, only in those specific instances defined in Section 101.52, based upon the standards set forth in
Section 101.53 where, owing to special conditions of a lot, strict enforcement of the provisions or requirements of
this ordinance would cause undue hardship or exceptional practical difficulty, or would conflict with the Village's
adopted land use objectives and policies.
101.52 Variances Authorized - Variances from the provisions and requirements of this ordinance shall be granted
by the Commission only in accordance with the standards established in Section 101.53 and shall be limited to the
following circumstances and no others:
(1) To vary the applicable bulk regulations for buildings and structures, including maximum height, lot
coverage, required yard areas and other required open space.
(2) To vary the applicable minimum requirements for lot frontage and distances from lot lines.
(3) To vary the applicable minimum requirements for lot frontage and distances from lot lines in conjunction
with the grant of a special exception pursuant to Section 86 of this ordinance.
101.53 Standards for Variances - The Commission shall not grant a variance as authorized in Section 101.52
unless it shall, in each case, make specific written findings of fact directly based upon the particular evidence
presented to it which support written conclusions that:
(1) The variance requested arises from physical conditions of the lot which are very unusual, that is, conditions
which are rarely found in the same district and the conditions are created by the provisions or requirements
of this ordinance and not by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant, such that the literal
interpretation of the ordinance would deprive the property owner or the applicant of rights commonly
enjoyed by other properties in the same district;
(2) The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the specific property involved
would cause undue hardship or exceptional practical difficulty for the owner, lessee or occupant, as
26
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, or would conflict with the Village's adopted land use objectives
and policies, if the provisions of this ordinance were strictly enforced;
(3) The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or
improvements or character in or of the neighborhood in which the subject property is located, not impair an
adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the Village
streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property
values within the neighborhood; and
(4) The variance desired will not conflict with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance.
The Commission may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the property benefited by a variance as the
Commission may deem necessary to comply with the standards set fourth in this section, to reduce or minimize the
impact of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood, review of the consistency of the proposed
structure’s features and building materials, and to further the purpose and intent of this ordinance.
101.54 Application for Variance - Any person owning or having an interest in property may file an application in
regard to such property with the City Manager for one or more of the variances authorized in Section 101.52 of this

Commission may, by rule, require:

construction on the property.
(2) The existing district classification of the property.
(3) The special conditions, circumstances or characteristics of the land, building or structure that prevent
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
(4) The extent to which it would be necessary to modify the requirements of this ordinance in order to permit
the proposed construction on the property.
(5) A statement of (i) the impact of the proposal upon significant natural environmental features on the
property; (ii) the methods proposed to preserve significant natural environmental features on the property;
and (iii) the adverse environmental impacts which cannot be avoided should the variance be granted.

101.53.

intent and purposes of this ordinance for the particular location in question.
