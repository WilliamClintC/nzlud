session. This report shall contain, at minimum, the yearly attendance of
committee members and summary of the committee's actions during
the calendar year.

matters as the liaison shall deem appropriate and advise the council on
any matters requiring governing body action.

Except as otherwise provided in these rules, Roberts Rules of Order shall
govern the deliberation of the Council.
§ 2-29. Yearly ethics and employment liability practice training.
All members of the governing body are responsible to attend yearly Ethics
and Employment Liability Practice training. Dates for training shall be

A. Notwithstanding any committee or liaison assignments, the Borough
Council as a whole and together with the Mayor operates as a collective
entity.
B. Giving specific direction or the specific tasking to the Borough
Administrator or paid professional is the prerogative of the governing
body as a whole. The Borough Administrator reports directly to the
Mayor and Council. The governing body shall set yearly goals and
objectives for the Administrator to be measured by an annual
performance evaluation.
C. It is also recognized that the notion of a chain of command is important
for the effective and harmonious undertaking of all operations and
activity. The Mayor and Council shall therefore convey direction or
specific tasks that are to be undertaken by a department or a single
employee, through the Borough Administrator, or in her/his absence,
through those duly selected by the Mayor and Council and the Borough
Administrator to act in such capacity on such occasion except as
otherwise provided by state statute or municipal ordinance.
D. Requests by members of the governing body for common information,
such as those that would be available to the average citizen, are
reasonable and not intended to be discouraged, nor should such simple
requests have to be funneled through the Borough Administrator if she/
he is not the primary respondent. The same spirit of reason should
prevail conversely, however, if the number of the requests, or the
frequency thereof become burdensome and intrusive upon the
employee's specific and properly delegated duties.
E. If the Mayor or any member of the Council wishes to meet with any
Borough employee regarding official Borough business, they must do so
within normal business hours unless otherwise mutually agreed upon
prior to said planned meeting.

body with date the materials will be received.
§ 2-31. Responsibility for materials.
All members of the Mayor and Council shall be responsible for all Borough
materials assigned to them. This will include electronic equipment, keys,
codebooks, etc. Upon the expiration of the term of office all materials

Borough's annually scheduled reorganization meeting. Any items lost or
stolen must be reported to the Borough Administrator as soon as possible.

Borough e-mail. Only the Borough Administrator, Clerk or Attorney may
send or reply to all sitting Council members or Council Elect.
§ 2-33. Use of technology for Borough business.
The use of text messaging for official Borough business is prohibited and
will not qualify as official business. Any technology issued by the Borough
will be used for the sole purpose of conducting official Borough business.

including in-kind contributions, to a campaign committee of any
Borough candidate or holder of a public office in the Borough,
whether or not that officeholder has the ultimate responsibility for
the hiring or the award of the contract, as the case may be, or to
any Borough or Bergen County party committee, or to any political
action committee (PAC) that is organized for the primary purpose
of promoting or supporting Borough candidates or Borough

party committee, or to any political action committee (PAC) that
is organized for the primary purpose of promoting or supporting
Borough candidates or Borough officeholders, including any state
party or legislative leadership committee, between the time of
first communication between that business entity or prospective
hiree, as the case may be, and the Borough regarding a specific
professional services agreement, or position of employment, as the
case may be, and the later of the termination of negotiations or the
completion of the contract or agreement with professional business
entity or hiree, as the case may be.

candidate for Mayor or Council, or municipal or county party committee
or PAC that is organized for the primary purpose of promoting or
supporting Borough candidates or Borough officeholders, including any
state party or legislative leadership committee, shall be deemed a
violation of this section, nor shall an agreement for property, goods or
services, of any kind whatsoever, be disqualified thereby, if that
contribution was made by the professional business entity or hiree prior
to the effective date of this section.
C. Contribution statement by professional business entity and vendor.
(1) Prior to awarding any contract or agreement to procure services
with any professional business entity, including banking or

receives reimbursement of a contribution from the Borough candidate
or municipal or county political party or PAC or state party or legislative
leadership committee.

balance at 50% of the initial balance. If at noon on any day the

50% of the initial balance, the application shall be deemed incomplete,
and the application will be postponed until the account is restored
to its initial level. In addition, any failure by the applicant to restore
the escrow account balance, as aforesaid, will be deemed consent by
the applicant to extend the statutory time limit allowed to the Board.
The clock shall be restarted on the date of the next meeting of the
Board at which the escrow fee balance has been restored to its initial

account balance, as aforesaid, will be deemed consent by the applicant
to extend the statutory time limit allowed to the Board. The clock shall
be started on the date of the next meeting of the Board at which the
escrow fee balance has been restored to its initial level. In addition,
no final action on any application shall be taken by the Board until the
deposits/escrow fees are in compliance with this section.
(1) If, upon passage of three meeting dates the escrow fee balance has
not been restored to its initial level, the Board shall consider such
failure to be a request by applicant to withdraw the application and
shall so advise the applicant in writing.

of costs for processing any application for development shall exceed the
deposits for said costs and/or if the applicant withdraws his application
or fails to pay the amount of such excesses, the payment for such
excesses shall immediately become the responsibility of the owner(s)
and the applicant of the subject property and the amount of such
excesses shall constitute a lien thereon.

§ 130-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq. and
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. delegated the responsibility to local governmental

conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
conducted under proper police supervision after application is made
and permission is issued by the Chief of Police for such demonstration.
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Oradell are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health.

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard.
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas.
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard.
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property, due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters.
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage.
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does
it include excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations
or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation
on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.[Amended 4-21-1987 by Ord. No. 800; 9-19-1995 by
Ord. No. 1039]

or a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above
ground.[Amended 9-19-1995 by Ord. No. 1039]
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its beforedamaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred.[Added 9-19-1995 by Ord.
No. 1039]
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local Code
Enforcement Officer and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or

Insurance Administration upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that § 130-15D(1)
through (11) has been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure. [Amended
9-19-1995 by Ord. No. 1039]
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in § 130-15D; or conflict
with existing local laws or ordinances.
F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
§ 130-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-16
1:171
§ 130-17. General standards for flood hazard reduction.

(3) On-site waste disposal system shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(4) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding. [Added
9-19-1995 by Ord. No. 1039]
D. Subdivision proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities,
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.

thirty-minute period.

obligation to pay such charges as provided herein. The Tax Collector
shall charge upon any delinquent account of such sewer charge,
interest and penalties at the same rate and in the same amounts as may
be charged against delinquent accounts of municipal taxes pursuant to

SEXUAL HARASSMENT PERSONNEL POLICY
GENERAL REFERENCES
Personnel practices  See Ch. 47A.
§ 234-1. Declaration of policy on sexual harassment.
The Borough of Oradell expressly prohibits any form of sexual harassment.
Improper interference with the ability of employees to perform their
expected job duties will not be tolerated. It is Borough of Oradell policy that
all employees have a right to work in an environment free of discrimination,
which encompasses freedom from sexual harassment. The Borough of
Oradell strongly disapproves of sexual harassment of its employees, in any
form, and states that all employees at all levels of the Borough of Oradell
must avoid offensive or inappropriate sexual and/or sexually harassing
behavior at work and will be held responsible for ensuring that the work
§ 224-2 ORADELL CODE § 234-1
1:278
place is free from sexual harassment. All employees, female or male, shall
be permitted to work in an environment free from all forms of unlawful
discrimination and conduct which can be considered harassing, coercive
or disruptive, including sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a form of
employee misconduct which undermines the integrity of the employment
relationship. Sexual harassment debilitates morale and interferes with work
productivity and, therefore, will not be tolerated.
§ 234-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning
indicated:
SEXUAL ASSAULT  Gross sexual imposition such as touching, fondling,
grabbing or assault.
SEXUAL BRIBERY  Solicitation of sexual activity or other sex-linked
behavior by promise of reward.
SEXUAL COERCION  Coercion of sexual activity by threat of punishment.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT  Any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct based on gender when:
§ 234-3. Guidelines.
Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of a person's employment;
A.
Submission or rejection of such conduct by a person is used as a basis
for employment decisions affecting that person;
B.
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with
a person's work performance; or
C.
D. Such conduct creates an intimidating or offensive work environment.
A. The Borough policy prohibits unwelcome sexual advances; requests for
sexual acts or favors with or without accompanying promises, threats or
reciprocal favors or actions; or other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of adversely affecting an
employee's performance or which creates a hostile or offensive working
environment. Examples of prohibited conduct include but are not
limited to lewd or sexually suggestive comments; slurs and other
verbal, graphic or physical conduct relating to an individual's sex; or
any display of sexually explicit pictures, greeting cards, articles, comic
books, magazines, photos or cartoons.
B. In order to ensure the integrity of the work environment, supervisory
personnel are required to ensure adherence to and compliance with
this policy; and, upon being informed of possible sexual harassment,
are required to take appropriate immediate action in response,
including informing employees of their right to file a discrimination
complaint with the Administrator.
§ 234-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234-3
1:279
§ 234-4. Complaint procedure.
C. Employees are encouraged, whether directly or through a third party,
to notify the alleged harasser that the behavior in question is offensive
and unwelcome. However, failure to do so does not preclude filing a
complaint. Employees are encouraged to promptly report all alleged
incidents of sexual harassment to the Administrator.
A. Who may file. Any Borough employee who feels that he or she has been
the victim of sexual harassment, or who witnessed acts of sexual
harassment against a fellow employee of the Borough, may file a
complaint of sexual harassment with the following persons in the
following order: (1) his or her department head; (2) the Borough
Administrator; or (3) the Mayor and Council. Any filing of a complaint
against a person other than the complainant's department head must
be accompanied by a statement that the person to whom the complaint
should otherwise be addressed in accordance with the list hereinabove,
cannot, according to the complainant, be objective about the sexual
harassment charge the complainant wishes to file.
B. Contents of complaint. The initial complaint may be made orally or in
writing. If the complaint is made orally, the Borough Administrator or
the alternate officer shall reduce same to a written document which
shall, if it is deemed accurate, be signed by the complainant. The
complaint must include the following information:
(1) The name, department and position or title of the complainant;
(2) The name, department and position or title of the charged party;
(3) The date, time, nature and circumstances, in detail, of each
instance of alleged sexual harassment, including but not limited to,
the injuries or consequences suffered by the complainant, the
names of any witnesses to such actions and the duration of the
actions at issue; and
(4) Whether such harassment has been previously reported, and if so,
the date and to whom it was reported.
Nothing in this section shall prevent the complainant from
providing other information or documents they believe are
essential to the fair adjudication of their case.
C. Investigation of filed complaint. The Borough Administrator is hereby
designated as the sexual harassment officer. The Chief Financial Officer
of the Borough is hereby designated as the alternate officer. Persons
who, by reason of the circumstances, are uncomfortable directing a
complaint to the Administrator, may report same to the alternate
officer. The Borough Administrator, or alternate officer, shall be
responsible for the prompt and thorough investigation of each claim.
The investigation shall be completed within five business days of filing
of the complaint, and a written report of the investigation shall be
§ 234-3 ORADELL CODE § 234-4
1:280
§ 234-5. Determination of guilt.
§ 234-6. Sanctions.
forwarded to the Mayor within seven days of the completion of the
investigation. A copy of the report shall be furnished to the
complainant. It shall be the duty of the person responsible for the
investigation to: (1) interview the complainant, potential witnesses and
the charged party; (2) review municipal files for similar incidents
involving the complainant and the charged party; and (3) assess the
presence or absence of corroborative evidence.
D. To the extent possible, the sexual harassment investigative proceedings
will be conducted in a manner to protect the confidentiality of the
complainant, the alleged harasser and all witnesses. All parties involved
in the proceedings will be advised to maintain strict confidentiality,
from the initial meeting to the final decision, to safeguard the privacy
and reputation of all involved. The investigation shall make every
attempt to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided to
the investigator.
E. A finding of no probable cause as a result of an investigation does not
necessarily establish that an accusation is false. However, this policy
shall not be used to intentionally bring frivolous or malicious charges
against an employee.
A. Standard for determination of guilt. The Borough Administrator or the
alternate officer shall determine that a charged party is not guilty of the
offense of sexual harassment unless he/she/they find, based on the
investigation and hearing, in the case of an appeal, that substantial,
credible evidence supports the conclusion that: (i) the facts as alleged
by the complainant are true; (ii) those facts constitute sexual
harassment defined herein; and (iii) the charged party is the person
who committed the act of sexual harassment.
B. If the validity of the complaint cannot be determined, immediate and
appropriate action will be taken to assure that all parties are
reacquainted with the sexual harassment policy as to prevent sexual
harassment in the future.
A. Penalties. In the event of an appeal, the Borough Administrator, or the
alternate officer, shall be permitted to impose the following penalties or
conditions of employment upon a Borough employee found to have
committed the offense of sexual harassment:
(1) Written reprimand which shall become a part of the employee's
personnel file;
(2) Discharge or demotion;
(3) Require the employee to undergo psychological therapy at his or
her own expense;
§ 234-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234-6
1:281
§ 234-7. Retaliation.
(4) Suspension (with or without pay); and
(5) Referral to the criminal justice system.
Any disciplinary action shall be consistent with applicable
collective bargaining agreements and any applicable Borough
Personnel Code provisions.43
B. Appeal to the Mayor and Council. A complainant or charged party may
appeal the determination of the Borough Administrator to the Mayor
and Council. The appealing party must file a request for an appeal in
writing with the Borough Administrator within 10 days of the
determination of the Borough Administrator stating why the
determination of the Borough Administrator should be overturned. The
party not appealing shall have the option of submitting, within 10 days
of the filing of the request for an appeal, a statement explaining why the
determination of the Borough Administrator should be affirmed. The
determination by the Mayor and Council shall be a final action.
C. To the extent permitted by law, the Borough will not be liable for
damages obtained as a result of a decision of a nonlocal agency or court
of superior administrative remedies described herein.
A. Retaliation. It shall be a violation of this policy for any employee to take
reprisals against any person because she/he has filed a complaint,
testified or assisted in any proceeding under this policy. Threats, other
forms of intimidation, and/or retaliation against the complainant or any
other party based on involvement in the complaint process may be
cause for disciplinary action. There will be no retaliation against
employees for reporting sexual harassment or assisting the Borough in
the investigation of a complaint. However, if after investigating any
complaint of harassment or unlawful discrimination the Borough learns
that the complaint is not bona fide or that an employee has provided
false information regarding the complaint, disciplinary action may be
taken against the individual who provided the false information.
B. False accusations. Since a charge of sexual harassment is a grave and
serious one, false accusations of sexual harassment are, and will be
treated as, a disciplinary offense and will result in a level of punishment
appropriate for a person actually engaging in such behavior.
A person who knowingly and/or recklessly fails to give truthful
testimony to the Administrator shall also be guilty of having made false
accusations.

trained to lead or implement such training, which shall include a detailed
discussion of the following:

stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans.
Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site
design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on
the site or from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans
should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin,
nature and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve
the established performance standards for water quality, quantity and
groundwater recharge.

development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review
process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance. In their interpretation
and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be

A. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 234A-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.
§ 234A-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234A-3
1:289
§ 234A-4. Stormwater management requirements for major
development.
(2) The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development
and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on
water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and
maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new
major development to the extent that alternative design and
performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater
management plan or water quality management plan adopted in
accordance with Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 234A-10.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department Landscape Project or Natural Heritage
Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
13:1B-15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or
Clemmys muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality requirements
of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of an
existing public roadway or railroad, or the construction or enlargement
of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following conditions are
met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternative analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
§ 234A-3 ORADELL CODE § 234A-4
1:290
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at Subsection E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss.
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces.
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation.
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from
preconstruction to postconstruction. "Time of concentration" is
defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the
hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed.
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading.
(f) Minimize soil compaction.
(g) Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas.
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:

applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid
and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of
this subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,

exemptions to this standard see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches or
is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest

Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates and grates of
spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground
surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges),
driveways, parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks,
lawns, fields, open channels and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.

available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 234A-7 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 234A-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area or to
projects subject to Subsection F[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
§ 234A-4 ORADELL CODE § 234A-4
1:294
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading.
"High pollutant loading areas" are areas in industrial
and commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than reportable
quantities, as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels; and lubricants, solvents and detergents that
are related to process, manufacturing or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high-water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
down gradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 234-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
§ 234A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234A-4
1:295
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 234A-2 shall be submitted to
the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval
in accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
subsection, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
§ 234A-4 ORADELL CODE § 234A-4
1:296
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or
in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from
this requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches
of rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 234A-7 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in § 234A-7. TSS reduction
shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in
Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
§ 234A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234A-4
1:297
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs,
and
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater wetland 90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 234A-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 234A-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
§ 234A-4 ORADELL CODE § 234A-4
1:298
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center-line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or
center-line of the waterway where the bank is undefined.
All encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-site Stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
§ 234A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234A-4
1:299
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.

§ 234A-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods) or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows or
culverts that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.

§ 234A-6. Standards for structural and nonstructural stormwater
measures.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/, or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures.
(1) Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(a) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to take into account the existing site conditions,
including, for example, environmentally critical areas;
wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonal highwater
table; soil type, permeability and texture; drainage area
and drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-prone
carbonate rocks (limestone).
(b) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and
repairs and ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet structure as appropriate
and shall have parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the
bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For
elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the
parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no greater
than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the
width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one
inch and a maximum spacing between bars of six inches. In
addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the
requirements of § 234A-8B.
(c) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed, constructed and installed to be strong, durable and
corrosion resistant. Measures that are consistent with the
§ 234A-5 ORADELL CODE § 234A-6

relevant portions of the Residential Site Improvement
Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 5:21-7.4 and 5:21-7.5 shall be
deemed to meet this requirement.
(d) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management
basin, the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in
diameter.
(e) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins
at § 234A-8.
(2) Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the
New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 234A-4 of this chapter.
(3) Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the
requirements of § 234A-4 of this chapter, provided the pollutant
removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for
Advanced Technology and certified by the Department.
B. Nonstructural stormwater strategies.
(1) Strategies.
(a) Buffers. Buffer areas are required along all lot and street lines
separating residential uses from arterial and collector streets,
separating a nonresidential use from either a residential use or
residential zoning district line and along all street lines where
loading and storage areas can be seen from the street. The
buffer area shall use native vegetation, which requires less
fertilization and watering than nonnative species. Buffer areas
may be used for stormwater management by disconnecting
impervious surfaces and treating runoff from these impervious
surfaces. Preservation of natural wood tracts and limiting land
disturbance for new construction must be incorporated where
practical.
(b) Curbs and gutters. Curb cuts or flush curbs with curb stops are
encouraged where practical to allow vegetated swales to be
used for stormwater conveyance and to allow the
disconnection of impervious areas where practical.
(c) Drainage systems. An existing ordinance may require that all
streets be provided with inlets and pipes where the same are
necessary for proper drainage. The use of natural vegetated
swales in lieu of inlets and pipes are encouraged where
practical.
§ 234A-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 234A-6
1:303
(d) Driveways and accessways. The use of pervious paving
materials to minimize stormwater runoff and promote
groundwater recharge should be considered for driveways and
accessways, where practical. Consideration should be given
for subsurface soil conditions. The use of crowned driveways is
also encouraged to promote disconnectivity between
impervious surfaces and grass areas to promote groundwater
recharge.
(e) Natural features. Natural features, such as trees, brooks,
swamps, hilltops and views, are to be preserved whenever
possible, and that care be taken to preserve selected trees to
enhance soil stability and landscaped treatment of the area. In
addition, forested areas shall be maintained to ensure that leaf
litter and other beneficial aspects of the forest are maintained
in addition to the trees.
(f) Nonconforming uses, structures or lots. The existing ordinance
may allow an applicant/owner of an existing use to propose
additions or alterations that exceed the permitted building
and/or lot coverage percentages. The applicant should mitigate
the impact of the additional impervious surfaces unless the
stormwater management plan for the development provided
for these increases in impervious surfaces. This mitigation
effort must address water quality, flooding and groundwater
recharge.
(g) Off-site and off-tract improvements. Any off-site and off-tract
stormwater management and drainage improvements must
conform to the design and performance standards described
herein.
(h) Off-street parking and loading. Parking lots with more than 10
spaces and all loading areas should allow for flush curb with
curb stop or curbing with curb cuts to encourage developers to
allow for the discharge of impervious areas into landscaped
areas for stormwater management. The use of natural
vegetated swales for the water quality design storm, with
overflow for larger storm events into storm sewers, should be
utilized where practical. A developer may demonstrate that
fewer spaces would be required, provided area is set aside for
additional spaces if necessary. Previous paving could be
provided as overflow parking areas.
(i) Performance standards. Pollution source control must be
evaluated in order to prohibit materials or wastes from being
deposited upon a lot in such form or manner that they can be
transferred off the lot, directly or indirectly, by natural forces
such as precipitation, evaporation or wind. Materials and
wastes that might create a pollutant or a hazard shall be
enclosed in appropriate containers.
§ 234A-6 ORADELL CODE § 234A-6
1:304
§ 234A-7. Sources for technical guidance.
(j) Shade trees. The preservation of mature trees and forested
areas must be considered in the management of environmental
resources, particularly watershed management, air quality and
ambient heating and cooling. A critical disturbance area that
extends beyond the driveway and building footprint where
clearing of trees cannot occur shall be depicted on the plan
minimizing land disturbance. Identification of forested areas
and the percentage of wooded areas be protected from
disturbance shall also be provided.
(k) Sidewalks. Sidewalks should be designed to discharge
stormwater to neighboring lawns, where feasible, to
disconnect these impervious surfaces or use permeable paving
materials where appropriate.
(l) Soil erosion and sediment control. The applicant shall comply
with the New Jersey Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
standards and should incorporate signs to retain and protect
natural vegetation; minimize and retain water runoff to
facilitate groundwater recharge; and install diversions,
sediment basins and similar required structures prior to any
on-site grading or disturbance.
(2) Further guidance on the implementation of these strategies can be
found in the NJDEP Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual, April 2004, as amended, accessible as noted within
§ 234A-5B(1).

A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. The
provisions of this section do not preempt more stringent municipal or
county safety requirements for new or existing stormwater
management basins. Municipal and county stormwater management
plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their authority, require existing
stormwater management basins to be retrofitted to meet one or more of
the safety standards in Subsection B(1), (2) and (3) for trash racks,
overflow grates and escape provisions at outlet structures.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A "trash rack" is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable and corrosion resistant and shall be designed to
§ 234A-7 ORADELL CODE § 234A-8
1:306
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
removable for emergencies and maintenance.
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable and corrosion resistant and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection B(3), "escape provisions" means
the permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs or other
features that provide easily accessible means of egress from
stormwater management basins. Stormwater management basins
shall include escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
Subsection C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted
from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than two and one-half feet. Such safety ledges
shall be comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four feet to
six feet in width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2
feet below the permanent water surface, and the second step
shall be located one to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water
surface. See Subsection D for an illustration of safety ledges in
a stormwater management basin.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or exemption
from the safety standards for stormwater management basins may be
granted only upon a written finding by the appropriate reviewing
agency (municipality, county or Department) that the variance of
exemption will not constitute a threat to public safety.
D. Illustration of safety ledges in a new stormwater management basin.

Sump Pump Discharge
[Adopted 10-23-2018 by Ord. No. 18-12]
§ 234A-12. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to prohibit the discharge of sump pump or
other mechanical discharge of any stormwater onto any Borough street or
sidewalk when such a discharge would create a hazardous condition.
§ 234A-13. Sump pump discharge.
There shall be no sump pump discharges or mechanical discharge of any
stormwater directly onto any Borough street or sidewalk if in the
professional opinion of the Superintendent of Public Works, the
Construction Official or Borough Engineer, or their designee, that said
discharge would create a hazardous condition. If a hazardous condition is
created by discharge onto Borough streets or sidewalks then sump pump
or mechanical discharge of stormwater must be discharged so that it will
percolate into the soil, and not run directly into any public streets or
sidewalks.
§ 234A-14. Penalties.
Any person(s), entity, firm or corporation or other group found guilty of
violating any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to any penalty
as set forth in the Revised General Ordinances. Each daily incident shall be

A. Generally. The New Jersey State Department of Transportation 2007
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, with all
amendments and supplements, shall govern all of the work performed
under Borough of Oradell road opening permits, except as
supplemented below.
(1) No Borough road shall be closed to traffic without prior written
consent of the Police Department and a permit issued by the
Construction Official. In the event that a road is closed, uniformed
police may be required to act as traffic directors, and the proper
traffic control devices shall be erected and maintained in
accordance with standards described in the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, 1988 Current Edition. All costs of providing
uniformed police shall be the responsibility of the permittee or the
§ 235-12 ORADELL CODE § 235-13
1:322
owners. The Borough will bill the permittee for such services at the
prevailing rate specified annually by the Borough. In the event that
a detour is deemed necessary by the permittee, application shall be
made to the Chief of Police, who shall determine the necessity for
such detour and the route to be followed. In emergency situations,
notification by phone to the Police Department shall be done prior
to start of work.
(2) Any work under an issued permit must be commenced within three
months from the date of issue and completed 45 days from
commencement, or said permit shall be deemed void, and
reapplication shall be required. The Superintendent of Department
of Public Works or the Borough Engineer may grant a single fortyfive-
day completion extension past the original permit expiration
date.
(3) Work commenced under a permit shall be continued expediently
during normal working hours until completed.
(4) The applicant shall notify the Superintendent of the Department of
Public Works or the Borough Engineer 24 hours in advance of the
actual commencement of any work on an extensive opening, or on
the same day for a minor opening.
B. Guard. The applicant shall keep the work site properly guarded both
day and night and shall have lights, barriers and adequate safety
devices as described in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
placed thereat and maintained throughout the performance of the work
and shall interfere as little as possible with the traffic along the street
or road within the Borough, and only that part of any such street or
road as is set forth in the permit shall be opened.
C. Cover and protection. All utilities shall be constructed with adequate
depth of cover protection for the utilities in the event that further
Borough road construction, repair or modification necessitates
excavation, undercutting or installation of facilities in the area where
the utility is located. This location will in no way relieve the utility
owner of the responsibility of relocating said utility at said utility
owner's expense in case of conflict with future construction,
reconstruction or modification of related facilities, except as otherwise
specified herein.
D. Protection of existing structures. It shall be the responsibility of the
permittee to give other notice of the proposed street opening to any
person, firm or corporation whose pipe, conduits or other structures are
laid in the portion of the street to be opened. Said notice shall be given
to all utilities by calling the Garden State Underground Plant Location
Service at telephone number 1-800-272-1000 48 hours before
commencement of said opening, or as provided by law, and the
permittee shall restore the same, at his own expense, to the condition it
was in prior to commencement of work.
§ 235-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-13
1:323
§ 235-14. Repair and cleaning of streets and property.
§ 235-15. Inspections.
The Superintendent of the Department of Public Works or Borough
Engineer shall periodically inspect all road openings and the repair and
resurfacing thereof for the purpose of determining compliance with the
conditions imposed on the issuance of the permit and the specifications. The
Borough may, upon the recommendation of either of them:
E. All excavations shall be completely backfilled at the end of each
working day unless it would constitute a hardship to the permittee or
where the size of the excavation makes it impossible to backfill at the
end of each working day, in which event a waiver may be granted by the
Superintendent of the Department of Public Works or Borough
Engineer. In the event that a waiver is granted, the contractor or owner
shall cover the excavation with heavy one-inch-thick steel plates
secured to existing pavement to prevent rattles and movement and
erect appropriate barriers and lights around the entire excavation and
arrange to provide appropriate security protection, if such security is
necessary, at his own cost, and such other safeguards as may be needed
to protect the public from an open excavation. If steel plates are placed
for over a weekend or for an extended period, all edges are to be
macadam-sealed and sloped. In no event shall an excavation be left
open for more than 72 hours unless an emergency exists and
permission has been secured from the Chief of Police, Superintendent
of the Department of Public Works and Borough Engineer or their
designated representatives.
F. Permittee shall contact the Superintendent of Public Works at least
three hours prior to final backfilling. The Superintendent of Public
Works or his designee shall be on site to supervise final backfilling and
ensure compliance with Borough requirements. Permittee shall be
responsible for payment of the Department of Public Works employee's
time at a rate set forth in § 230-18C(2).
A. The permittee shall be liable for any damage to the roadway leading to
or adjacent to the work site.
B. The permittee shall, on a continuing basis, maintain all streets and
other property affected by the construction in a clean condition free
from all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris. Upon completion
of all work under the permit, the permittee shall again clean the
affected property and remove all debris and unused material. In the
event that the permittee fails to act as provided herein, the Borough,
upon 24 hours' notice to the permittee, may clean and remove all
rubbish, excess earth, rock, debris and unused material and charge the
permittee the cost thereof. If the permittee fails to reimburse the
Borough for the costs incurred, said costs shall be deducted from the
permittee's deposit held by the Borough Clerk.
§ 235-13 ORADELL CODE § 235-15
1:324
§ 235-16. Specifications.
A. Order a temporary stop to any road paving.
B. Order that the applicant perform or correct work in accordance with
the direction of the Borough.
C. Order a stop to any work and revoke the permit, in which event the
Borough of Oradell shall complete the work, or cause it to be
completed, and either declare the applicant's deposit forfeited or notify
the applicant's surety of an intent to file claim on the bond, or both to
the extent necessary to complete the work.
D. Authorize the correction of any work after notification to the permittee
and after the neglect or the refusal of the permittee to make such
corrections within 24 hours and, after the completion of same, either
declare the permittee's deposit forfeited or notify the permittee's surety
of an intent to file a claim on the bond, or both to the extent necessary
to make the necessary corrections.
E. Take any other action deemed reasonable under the circumstances to
protect the Borough's interests.
A. The existing pavement must be cut with a compressor, wet saw or an
approved mechanical cutting device in a straight line and to the full
depth of pavement before excavation. All storm drains and catch basins
will be protected at all times. Any damage will be repaired by the
applicant at the applicant's expense.
B. All fill removed from the trench is to be discarded by the applicant. The
trench must be of suitable width to obtain proper mechanical
compaction. All backfill is to be done with quarry process stone Type I-5
or DGA for the full depth of the trench. The first lift of fill, 12 inches
above pipe, shall be compacted using a Jumping Jack tamper.
Successive lifts shall be compacted by mechanical means such as
tamping, vibrating or rolling. A vibra plate tamper is not acceptable.
C. Upon completion of the proper backfill compaction, a ten-inch layer of
bituminous stabilized base Mix I-2 shall be utilized in two lifts of five
inches each compacted in all trench areas. The top surface shall be
flush with the adjacent pavement and be uniformly contoured to
conform to the existing surrounding surface.
D. For installation of plastic piping, the applicant shall place a sand
cushion around the plastic piping for a minimum distance of 12 inches
from the pipe.
E. The applicant must install and maintain temporary line striping and
pavement markings.
§ 235-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-16
1:325
F. The applicant further agrees to keep the trench filled to the level of
surrounding pavement until settlement has ceased. The Borough shall
be held harmless in any and all accidents arising out of trench defects.
G. After a reasonable settlement period, final restoration will require
infrared application or a two-inch compacted surface course of
bituminous surface course Mix I-5 to be placed over the entire area of
stabilized base.
(1) Infrared resurfacing shall be permitted in accordance with the
specifications set forth in Subsection H below. When using infrared
resurfacing application, all stabilized base material in the road
opening, plus a minimum of six inches surrounding the edge of the
opening, require heating and raking to a depth of one inch. All
raked material is to be discarded and replaced by fresh, hot FABC
top mix.
(2) Prior to the application of the surface course, the entire area of
stabilized base, including 12 inches surrounding the edge of the
opening, shall be milled by a milling machine (self-propelled,
power-operated planing, grinding or cutting machine) to a
minimum depth of two inches from the outside edge of the trench
to the curbline in a uniform width a minimum of 10 feet wide.
(3) The resulting milled surface shall then be swept, and tack coat
material applied, before the two-inch compacted surface course is
laid. This course shall be thoroughly compacted flush with the
surrounding surface by vibratory rolling and be uniformly
contoured to the adjacent pavement.
(4) All manhole frames and covers installed within the pavement area
shall be set to finished grade. Any scarring or road damage to any
other part of a roadway caused by this permit shall be repaired as
per the above conditions.
H. Specifications for infrared restoration.
(1) The purpose of this specification is to establish a consistent and
standard process for infrared paving applications and to insure the
quality of infrared restoration for road openings.
(2) The contractor shall provide all materials, equipment and labor
required to perform a seamless, to-grade, permanent infrared
restoration.
(3) The infrared contractor shall provide FABC at plant temperature of
275° F. to 300° F. The infrared contractor must guarantee that the
asphalt will be transported and stored in a thermostatically
controlled storage unit. Asphalt should not be kept in a storage unit
at plant temperature for a period longer than 24 hours.
(4) Required equipment:
§ 235-16 ORADELL CODE § 235-16
1:326
§ 235-17. Insurance, security and deposits.
(a) The infrared heater must have the ability to soften asphalt to a
depth of 1 1/2 inches to two inches in eight to 10 minutes
without burning the surface. The heater must be a minimum
size of six feet by eight feet. A truck-mounted infrared heater is
the preferred equipment.
(b) A thermostatically controlled asphalt storage unit which
maintains a temperature of 275° F. to 300° F.
(c) A roller-type compactor that will generate at least one ton of
applied force per square inch.
(d) A steel asphalt rake that is strong enough to scarify to a depth
of two inches.
(e) A thirty-six-inch asphalt loot.
(5) The contractor opens the road and performs the repair or adds a
new service. The hole is then filled in accordance with specific
Borough requirements for sub-base fill and compaction. Adequate
space is left for base asphalt. The vertical inside edge of the
existing pavement is cleaned of dirt and then tack coated. If this
edge is not tack coated, sheer point cracking may occur after the
infrared repair is completed. The opening is then filled with binder
asphalt (three-fourths-inch aggregate) as a stabilized base, being
sure to properly compact the asphalt even with the existing road.
The repair should settle within 60 to 90 days to allow weather,
traffic and time to thoroughly compact the repair before the
infrared repair is performed.
I. Final line striping and pavement markings must be restored
immediately to original or better condition. The standard for the
Borough for line striping and traffic markings is the application of
thermoplastic.
A. Insurance. The applicant shall present evidence satisfactory to the
Borough Attorney of insurance sufficient to indemnify and save
harmless the Borough, its agents and servants against and from all suits
and costs of every kind and from all personal injury or property damage
resulting from negligence or from any phase of operations performed
under the permit. Said insurance shall provide limits of not less than
$1,000,000 of single limit or, in the case of a public utility, may be in the
form of a certificate of self-insurance. Where there is an extensive
opening, the Superintendent of the Department of Public Works or the
Borough Engineer may request additional insurance if it is deemed
necessary under the circumstances.
B. Security.
§ 235-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-17
1:327
(1) The Construction Official shall not issue a permit unless the
applicant has deposited as security for faithful performance a
certified check made payable to the Borough of Oradell or filed a
bond with the surety satisfactory to the Borough Attorney, the
amount thereof, to be based upon the security deposit fee schedule
as contained in § 230-18 of this article.
(2) In lieu of the security deposit required above, a public utility
applicant may file with the Construction Official a corporate
performance bond in the amount of at least $20,000. This corporate
performance bond must be an annual one and must be renewed
annually. In the event that a public utility applicant applies for a
permit for road opening and/or road openings and the required
security deposit fee set forth in § 230-18 exceeds said $20,000 the
public utility applicant shall file a corporate performance bond in
an amount equal to the difference between the $20,000 and the
required security deposit. For all nonpublic utility applicants, the
surety bond shall be at least $1,000. A certified check for a lesser
amount may be deposited, however, in the amount provided by
§ 230-18 for the work to be performed.
(3) Upon satisfactory completion of all work permitted or required
under the permit for extensive openings, if the security deposit is
$2,000 or less, the Borough of Oradell will retain 100% of the
security deposit as security for maintenance of said work for a
period not to exceed one year from the date of completion,
provided that if the security deposit is in the form of a certified
check, the permittee may deposit a surety bond of $2,000
satisfactory to the Borough Attorney in lieu of said certified check.
If the security deposit is greater than $2,000, then the Borough will
release or refund 60% or more of the same with the approval of the
Superintendent of Department of Public Works or Borough
Engineer, except that it shall retain a minimum of $2,000, and the
surety bond will be deposited for the maintenance as set forth
above. All bonds and certificates of insurance shall contain a
provision that the same shall remain in full force and effect for a
period of one year after the last work under any permit.
C. Application fee and escrow deposit.
(1) The applicant shall also pay, by separate money order, certified
check or, if the applicant is a public utility as herein defined, by a
corporate check, a nonrefundable application fee as set forth in
§ 230-18 of this article. An applicant other than a public utility shall
pay, by separate money order or certified check, a refundable
escrow deposit fee for inspection and professional services as set
forth in § 230-18 of this article. Should the escrow deposit fee
account at any time become insufficient to cover the actual or
anticipated inspection and professional expenses, said fund shall
be subject to increase on demand of the Borough Clerk.

§ 235-44. Specifications for concrete.
The following specifications provide specifications for the construction of
sidewalks of one-to-two-to-three concrete and of the single-course type.
Such sidewalks shall have a minimum width of four feet and a minimum
thickness of four inches:
A. Materials. The materials used shall be as follows:
(1) Sand. Sand for concrete and mortar shall be Cow Bay sand or
washed sand equal to Cow Bay, clean, coarse silica sand containing
not more than 5% of clay or loam and free from any organic matter
coating the grains. All of the particles must pass a one-fourth-inch
mesh sieve, not more than 30% by volume shall pass a No. 50 sieve
and not over 6% shall pass a No. 100 sieve.
(2) Crushed stone. The coarse aggregate for concrete shall be broken
trap rock or dolomite free from dust screenings, clay, dirt or other
objectionable substances. It shall be uniformly graded from 3/8
inch to 3/4 inch in size. It must not contain flat or elongated pieces
and must be hard and durable.
(3) Cement. Cement used for concrete shall be air-entraining cement
and shall conform to the latest revision of the American Society for
Testing and Materials: C-175 Type IIA. Unless otherwise permitted,
only one brand of cement shall be used at the same time.
(4) Cinders. Steam cinders used in the work shall be free from
particles that will pass through a one-fourth-inch mesh screen and
shall be composed of hard, durable cinders homogenous in
character.
B. Construction. The construction requirements shall be as follows:
(1) Excavation. All grass, roots, sod or other materials unsuitable for a
foundation shall be removed, together with such earth and rock as
is necessary to permit the surface of the sidewalk to be laid to the
proper grade. Where the sidewalk has to be placed on fill, the fill
shall be deposited in six-inch layers and rolled or tamped.
45.Editor's Note: See Ch. 240, Land Development.
§ 235-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-44
1:339
(2) Drainage.
(a) Where the subgrade is wet or apt to be frequently watersoaked,
provision shall be made to secure adequate drainage
by excavating the unsuitable material and filling in with
tamped cinders, sand, gravel or crushed stone and, if
necessary, by laying drainpipes.
(b) The Borough Engineer may order such work done or may
substitute equally efficient measures for securing adequate
drainage if, in his opinion, such work is necessary in order to
secure good construction
(3) Subbase. Unless otherwise permitted, all sidewalks shall be laid on
a foundation of cinders which have been thoroughly compacted by
tamping, ramming and wetting. The cinder foundation shall have a
minimum thickness, measured after compacting, of four inches.
The Borough Engineer may increase or decrease this depth of
cinders or may omit it entirely when, in his opinion, the nature of
the subsoil warrants such action.
(4) Concrete. Concrete shall be composed of one part cement, two
parts sand and three parts crushed stone. The mixing shall be done
in an approved type of concrete mixer and shall be carried on for at
least 50 revolutions and not more than 150 revolutions at the
manufacturer's specified speed. Transit-mix concrete may be used,
provided that the Borough Engineer is at liberty to inspect all
materials at the central mixing plant. The drum of the mixer shall
be vented during mixing. Excessive air-entraining due to overlong
mixing shall be corrected as directed by the Borough Engineer. The
volume of entrained air shall be equal to 3% to 6% of the volume of
concrete. The concrete shall be laid at once on the prepared bed in
one layer in slabs of five feet in length and of a minimum width of
four feet. Steel plates may be used to form the joints between the
slabs. Such plates shall be 1/4 inch in thickness and shall be
removed before the pouring of the adjoining slab. Slabs shall be
poured alternately, that is, every other slab shall be poured and
allowed to harden before the pouring of the one in between. The
sidewalks shall be finished by floating with a wood float. Care shall
be exercised to bring sufficient mortar to the surface. Bituminous
felt joints 1/2 inch thick shall be spaced at intervals not greater
than 75 feet apart. These joints shall also be placed wherever the
sidewalk intersects any other walk or curb.
(5) Height above curb; slope. All sidewalks shall be at least one inch
above the finished curb and shall have a slope of 1/4 inch per foot of
width towards the curb.
(6) Protection of surface. When completed, all walks shall be kept
moist and protected from traffic and the elements for three to four
days according to weather conditions. The forms shall be removed
§ 235-44 ORADELL CODE § 235-44
1:340

The following specifications provide for the construction of driveways of
bituminous concrete and of the double-course type.
with great care, and, upon their removal, the edges of the walks
shall be protected in a suitable manner.
C. Driveways. If driveways are required, they shall be built in the same
manner as prescribed for sidewalks, except that they are to be six
inches in thickness. A bituminous felt joint shall be placed between the
driveway and curb.
D. Driveway aprons. Driveway aprons shall be considered to consist of that
portion of the driveway extending from the curbline to the edge of the
sidewalk nearest the curb. The edge of the sidewalk nearest the curb
shall not be higher than the top line of the curb if projected, and the
apron shall run in a straight grade from this edge to the bottom of the
driveway opening or gutter.
E. Drains under sidewalks. No new leader pipe or other drain shall
discharge over the sidewalk, but shall be carried under the sidewalk to
the gutter in a cast-iron pipe or bituminized fiber pipe. The hole in the
curb shall be round, neatly cut, leaving at least one inch of solid stone
or concrete over the hole, doing no other damage to the curbing and
shall be of no larger diameter than necessary. When the sidewalk is but
four feet wide, the pipes shall be so laid that the hubs will not come
under the sidewalk. In the place of a cast-iron pipe or bituminized fiber
pipe, a trough of masonry may be constructed and covered with a
suitable cover having its top surface flush with the surface of the
sidewalk and of a rough character to prevent slipping. No trough shall
be wider than six inches.
F. Drop curb at driveways. Drop curbs at driveways shall be constructed
of concrete. Specifications for construction must meet the Residential
Site Improvement Standards for New Jersey. Granite/Belgian blocks
may be used in the drop curb and must meet the RSIS of NJ.

§ 235-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-45
1:341
§ 235-46. (Reserved)
§ 235-47. Strict compliance with specifications required.
Any person who shall construct, remove, repair, replace, reset or alter the
sidewalk or cause the construction, removal, repair, replacement or altering
of the sidewalk on any public street shall do so strictly in accordance with
the specifications and requirements set out in this article and under the
(1) Excavation and subgrade. All grass, roots, sod and other material
unsuitable for a foundation shall be removed, together with such
earth and rock as is necessary to permit the surface of the sidewalk
to be laid to the proper grade. Where the sidewalk has to be placed
on fill, the fill shall be deposited in six-inch layers and rolled or
tamped.
(2) Drainage. Where the subgrade is wet or apt to be frequently watersoaked,
provision shall be made to secure adequate drainage by
excavating the unsuitable material and filling in with tamped
cinders, sand, gravel or crushed stone and, if necessary, by laying
drainpipes. The Borough Engineer may order such work or may
substitute equally efficient measures for securing adequate
drainage if, in his opinion, such work is necessary in order to
secure good construction.
(3) Stone base and supporting walls. Before laying the stone base, oneinch-
by-six-inch boards or steel edging measuring at least 1/8 inch
thick and equal to the depth of the pavement shall be placed
vertically, on edge, as a form or frame strictly to the lines and
grades as established by the Borough Engineer. The forms shall be
well supported by stakes on the outer side only.
(4) Spreading. Immediately after being dumped, the bituminous
mixture shall be placed in its final position with forks, rakes or lutes
in such manner as to correct any segregation or other irregularities
in composition and so that the pavement course will have the
proper thickness, grade, contour and weight when finished. No
walking shall be done on the pavement mixture until it is rolled,
except when necessary to adjust surface irregularities by raking.
All porous spots, depressions and projections shall be carefully
removed from the top course by raking. The rate of spreading shall
not exceed that at which the raking can be satisfactorily done. The
bituminous mixture may be spread with a mechanical spreader,
provided that notice is given to and approval received from the
Borough Engineer.
(5) Rolling. Rolling shall be done with a power roller having a load of
not less than 330 pounds per linear inch of tread of rear wheels and
shall be in one direction only. Any roller not meeting this
requirement must be approved by the Borough Engineer before the
work commences.

The purposes of this chapter are to establish a pattern for land use based on
the Master Plan and to guide appropriate and orderly development which
will promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. To this
end, procedures for submitting and acting upon development applications
and setting design standards to guide the preparation of plans are included.
This chapter is intended to regulate the use of land within zoning districts;
secure safety from fire, flood, and other disasters; provide adequate light,
air and open space; limit and restrict buildings and structures to specified
districts according to their type and the nature and extent of their use
for trade, industry, residence, open space or other purposes; regulate the
bulk, height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures;
avoid a conflict with neighboring municipalities, the county and the state;
establish appropriate population densities and concentrations contributing
to the well-being of persons, neighborhoods, communities and regions and
the preservation of the environment; provide sufficient space for residential,
recreational, business, commercial and industrial uses and open space;
encourage the location and design of transportation routes which will
promote the free flow of traffic while discouraging the location of such
facilities and routes which result in congestion or blight; promote a
desirable visual environment; promote the preservation of valuable
historical resources; promote the conservation of buildings and their
appearance; preserve open space and valuable natural resources to prevent
urban sprawl and degradation of the environment through improper use of
land; provide procedures for planned developments which incorporate the
best features of design and relate the type, design and layout of residential,
business, commercial, industrial and recreational development to the
particular site; encourage coordination of various public and private

percentage of units for affordable housing. Where units will be
for sale, the minimum set aside shall be 20%. Where units will
be for rent, the minimum set aside shall be 15%. When
calculating the required number of affordable units, any
computation resulting in a fraction of a unit shall be rounded
upwards to the next whole number.
(b) All affordable units to be produced pursuant to this section
shall comply with the Borough's Affordable Housing Ordinance
at Chapter 61 of the Borough Code, as may be amended and
supplemented, the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls
("UHAC")(N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq.), or any successor
regulation, and the Borough's Housing Element and Fair Share
Plan, as may be amended from time to time. This includes, but
is not limited to, the following requirements for all affordable
units:
[1] Low/moderate income split: A maximum of 50% of the
affordable units shall be moderate-income units and a
minimum of 50% of the affordable units shall be lowincome
units. At least 13% of all restricted rental units
shall be very-low-income units, which shall be counted as
part of the required number of low-income units within the
development.
[2] Bedroom mix: If the development is not age-restricted, the
following bedroom mix shall apply:

the date of initial occupancy, a rental household's income
is found to exceed 80% of the regional median income, the
rental rate restriction shall expire at the later of either the
next scheduled lease renewal or 60 days. For for-sale
units, the deed restriction shall expire only after it is
properly released by the Borough and/or the Borough's
administrative agent.

B. Except in a CR Zone and as set forth in Subsection C below, the
maximum height of buildings in all districts within the Borough of
Oradell, except in B-1 and B-2, shall be 32 feet. This height calculation
shall be made by adding the height of all four corners of the building
measured from the finished grade level six feet off each corner to the
highest point on the roof (excluding chimneys) and dividing that
number by four. The result would be the height of the building.
Notwithstanding the above, the maximum height of any facade
including a parapet may not exceed 40 feet.
C. Special height restrictions shall be as follows:
(1) One- and two-family residences. If the slope from any side of the
principal building to the parallel or most nearly parallel property
line exceeds the rate of two feet for each 10 feet, the height of any
building is limited to 31 feet. This height calculation shall be made
by taking the vertical distance of a building measured from the top
of the highest point of a structure to the average finished grade
taken six feet from the building foundation, at the midpoint of each
building wall and at a point measured diagonally at 45° from each
corner. Where new grades are proposed, the grade measurement
cannot exceed a height established at more than one foot six inches
above the existing grade. The result would be the height of the
building.
(2) B-2 Zone. If the curb elevation was extended horizontally to the
center line of the building and at that point was in the upper 50% of
the first floor of the permitted building, the permitted height is 40
feet, but not more than three stories and not that set forth in
Subsection B above. The height shall be measured in accordance
with the procedures set forth in § 240-6.11B of this chapter.
D. The height shall be calculated based upon the existing or historic grade
of the property, whichever shall result in the greatest height. In no
event shall the regrading of a property eliminate a height variance.

ARTICLE VIII
Conditional Uses
§ 240-8.1. Intent of conditional uses.
Whereas certain uses, activities, structures and buildings are considered
necessary to serve the needs and convenience of the community and, at the
same time, recognizing that such uses may be or become detrimental to the
public health, safety and general welfare if located and operated without
proper consideration being given to the existing conditions and character
of the community and surrounding neighborhood, such uses and activities
may be permitted in certain specified areas under the terms of this chapter
and pursuant to the provisions of this section.
§ 240-8.2. Procedure and standards of review.
Before any permit shall be issued for a conditional use, applications shall be
made to the Planning Board, which shall grant or deny the application after
public hearing within 95 days of submission of a complete application or
within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant. Notice of
the hearing shall include reference to all matters being heard, including site
plan and/or subdivision, and the Planning Board shall review and approve
or deny any applicable subdivision or site plan simultaneously with the
conditional use application. Failure of the Planning Board to act within
the required time period shall constitute approval of the application. In
reviewing the application, the Planning Board shall review the number of
employees or users of the property and the requirements set forth in this
chapter, and shall give due consideration to elements that would affect the
public health, welfare, safety, comfort and convenience, such as, but not
limited to, the proposed use(s), the character of the area, vehicular travel
patterns and access, pedestrianways, landscaping, lighting, signs, drainage,
sewage treatment, potable water supply, utilities and structural location(s)
and orientation(s). Each conditional use shall be considered as an individual
case. In all requests for approval of conditional uses, the burden of proof
shall be on the developer, even though a conditional use shall be a permitted
use in the district in which it is located. Prior to making its decision, the
Board shall be satisfied that the conditional use is reasonably necessary for
the convenience of the public in the location proposed.
§ 240-8.3. Application details.
The application shall follow the submission requirements and the fees and
escrows for site plan review as outlined in this chapter. The fees and escrow
requirements for a conditional use application under this section shall be
the same as for a site plan application, and the procedures for approval of a
conditional use shall be the same as those for site plan approvals.
§ 240-8.4. Specific standards for certain conditional uses.

ARTICLE IX
Affordable Housing Zone
§ 240-9.1. Purpose.
In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990),
the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory development
fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985, N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301
et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to the Council on Affordable
Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules. This article establishes standards for
the collection, maintenance, and expenditure of development fees pursuant
to COAH's rules. Fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used for the
sole purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This article
shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development
fees.
§ 240-9.2. Basic requirements.
The Borough of Oradell shall not spend development fees until COAH has
approved a plan for spending such fees and Oradell has received thirdround
substantive certification from COAH or a judgment of compliance.
§ 240-9.3. Definitions.
The following terms, as used in this article, shall have the following
meanings:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  A development included in the
Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, and includes, but is not limited to,
an inclusionary development, a municipal construction project or a onehundred-
percent-affordable development.
COAH  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing.
DEVELOPMENT FEE  Funds paid by an individual, person, partnership,
association, company or corporation for the improvement of property as
permitted in COAH's rules.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The value of a property determined by
the municipal Tax Assessor through a process designed to ensure that all
property in the municipality is assessed at the same assessment ratio or
ratios required by law. Estimates at the time of issuance of a building permit
may be obtained utilizing estimates for construction cost. Final equalized
assessed value will be determined at project completion by the municipal
Tax Assessor.
§ 240-9.4. Residential development fees.
A. Residential developers shall pay a fee of 1% of the equalized assessed
value for any eligible residential development, provided no increased
density is permitted.
§ 240-9.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-9.4
1:431
§ 240-9.5. Nonresidential development fees.
§ 240-9.6. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions.

developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be realized.
A. Nonresidential developers shall pay a fee of 2% of the equalized
assessed value for any eligible nonresidential development.
B. If an increase in floor area ratio is approved pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(4), then the additional floor area realized (above what is
permitted by right under the existing zoning) will incur a bonus
development fee of 6% of the equalized assessed value for
nonresidential development. However, if the zoning on a site has
changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a
variance application, the base floor area for the purposes of calculating
the bonus development fee shall be the highest floor area permitted by
right during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
A. Affordable housing developments shall be exempt from development
fees. All other forms of new construction shall be subject to
development fees unless exempted below.
B. Developer of new nonresidential structures, except as excluded herein,
and new residential structures, shall pay a development fee in the
manner prescribed herein.
C. Developments that have received preliminary or final approval prior to
the imposition of a municipal development fee shall be exempt from
development fees unless the developer seeks a substantial change in
the approval.
D. Developers that expand an existing nonresidential structure and
expand a residential structure where it results in additional dwelling
units shall pay a development fee. The development fee shall be
calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed value of the
improved structure.

hospital for humans, or nursing home shall be exempt from paying a
development fee.

interest on the returned amount shall also be returned.
§ 240-9.9. Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
§ 240-9.10. Use of funds.

performance or maintenance guaranty to another governmental
agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case may be,
shall be required by the municipality for such utilities or improvements.
A. The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the

Borough Engineer. The request shall indicate which improvements have
been completed and which improvements remain incomplete in the
judgment of the obligor. Thereupon, the Borough Engineer shall inspect

estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer and appended to the
performance guaranty pursuant to Subsection A of this article.

improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
Borough Engineer, or reject any or all of these improvements upon the
establishment in the resolution of cause for rejection, and shall approve
and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the performance

D. In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the
municipality or approving authority as part of the performance
guaranty, then any partial reduction granted in the performance
guaranty pursuant to this subsection shall be applied to the cash
deposit in the same proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the
full amount of the performance guaranty.

improvements and, upon completion or correction, the same procedure
of notification as set forth in this section shall be followed.

AN ORDINANCE ADDING A NEW ARTICLE IX-A, TO BE ENTITLED
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MANDATORY SET-ASIDE, TO CHAPTER
240, LAND DEVELOPMENT, OF THE ORADELL BOROUGH CODE
INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT
This Ordinance amends the Borough land use ordinances by establishing new regulations to ensure that any site that
benefits from a subdivision or site plan approval, rezoning, use variance, redevelopment plan or rehabilitation plan
approved by the Borough or a Borough land use board that results in multi-family residential development of five (5)
dwelling units or more produces affordable housing at a set-aside rate of 20% for for-sale units and 15% for rental
units; which regulations will be set forth in the Borough Code in connection with the Boroughs Third Round Housing
Element and Fair Share Plan consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement reached with Fair Share Housing
Center regarding compliance with the Boroughs affordable housing obligations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Borough Council of the Borough of
Oradell, County of Bergen, State of New Jersey, as follows:
Section 1. Chapter 240, Article IX-A, of the Code of the Borough of Oradell entitled
Affordable Housing Mandatory Set-Aside is hereby created and established to read as follows:
Article IX-A: Affordable Housing Mandatory Set-Aside
§240-9.13 Affordable housing mandatory set-aside.
A. Purpose. This article is intended to ensure that any site that benefits from a subdivision or
site plan approval, rezoning, use variance, redevelopment plan or rehabilitation plan
approved by the Borough or a Borough Land Use Board that results in multi-family
residential development of five (5) dwelling units or more produces affordable housing at
a set-aside rate of twenty percent (20%) for affordable for-sale units and at a set-aside rate
of fifteen percent (15%) for affordable rental units. This article shall apply except where
inconsistent with applicable law.
B. Mandatory Set-Aside Requirement.
(1) Any multi-family or single-family attached residential development, including the
residential portion of a mixed-use project, that is approved to contain five (5) or more
new dwelling units as a result of a subdivision or site plan approval, rezoning, use
variance, redevelopment plan or rehabilitation plan approved by the Borough or a
Borough land use board shall be required to set aside a minimum percentage of units
for affordable housing.
(2) For inclusionary projects in which the low and moderate units are to be offered for sale,
the minimum set-aside percentage shall be twenty percent (20%); for projects in which
the low and moderate income units are to be offered for rent, the minimum set-aside 
percentage shall be fifteen percent (15%). Where the set-aside percentage results in a
fractional unit, the total set-aside requirement shall be rounded upwards to the next
whole number.
(3) Nothing in this article precludes the Borough or a Borough land use board from
imposing an affordable housing set-aside in a development not required to have a setaside pursuant to this article consistent with N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311(h) and other
applicable law.
(4) This requirement does not create any entitlement for a property owner or applicant for
subdivision or site plan approval, a zoning amendment, use variance, or adoption of a
redevelopment plan or rehabilitation plan in areas in need of redevelopment or
rehabilitation, or for approval of any particular proposed project.
(5) This requirement does not apply to any sites or specific zones for which higher setaside standards have been or will be established, either by zoning, subdivision or site
plan approval, or an adopted redevelopment plan or rehabilitation plan.
(6) Furthermore, this requirement shall not apply to developments containing four (4) or
less new dwelling units.
(7) If the Boroughs Settlement Agreement with Fair Share Housing Center (FSHC)
dated June 18, 2018, or the Boroughs 2018 Housing Element and Fair Share Plan,
establishes set-aside standards for any specific sites or zones which are different from
the set-aside standards set forth in this article, the set-asides established for those sites
or zones in the Settlement Agreement or Housing Element and Fair Share Plan shall
govern.
(8) Where a developer demolishes existing dwelling units and builds new dwelling units
on the same site, the provisions of this section shall apply only if the net number of
dwelling units is five (5) or more.
(9) All subdivision and site plan approvals of qualifying residential developments shall be
conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this section.
(10) All affordable units to be produced pursuant to this article shall comply with the
Boroughs Affordable Housing Ordinance at Chapter 61 of the Borough Code and the
Uniform Housing Affordability Controls (N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq.), as may be
amended from time to time.
Section 2. If any article, section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this
Ordinance is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the remaining portions of this Ordinance and they shall remain in full force and effect.
Section 3. In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of this Ordinance
and any prior ordinance of the Borough of Oradell, the provisions hereof shall be determined to
govern. All other parts, portions and provisions of the Revised General Ordinances of the Borough
of Oradell are hereby ratified and confirmed, except where inconsistent with the terms hereof.
Section 4. The Borough Clerk is directed to give notice at least ten (10) days prior to
a hearing on the adoption of this ordinance to the Bergen County Planning Board and to all other
persons entitled thereto pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-15, and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-63 (if required).

Article IX: Affordable Housing Development Fees
§240-9.1 Purpose.
A. In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990), the New
Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory development fees are authorized by the
Fair Housing Act of 1985, N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject
to the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, § 8 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2) and the Statewide NonResidential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 40:55D-8.7), COAH is
authorized to adopt and promulgate regulations necessary for the establishment,
implementation, review, monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust
funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under the jurisdiction of
the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and have a COAH-approved spending plan
may retain fees collected from nonresidential development.
C. This article establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and expenditure of
development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in accordance with P.L. 2008, c. 46,
§§ 8 and 32 through 38. Fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used for the sole
purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This article shall be interpreted
within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees, codified at N.J.A.C. § 5:93-
8.
D. This article shall not be effective until approved by COAH pursuant to N.J.A.C. § 5:93-
8.8(a).

Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:97 by N.J. Council on Affordable Housing (M-392-14)

GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES
Those strategies that minimize the impact of development on the environment, and enhance

A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zone districts, residential developers, except for developers of the types of

assessed value for residential development, provided no increased density is permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5) (known as
a "d" variance) has been permitted, developers may be required to pay a development
fee of 6% of the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be realized.
However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the two-year period preceding the
filing of such a variance application, the base density for the purposes of calculating
the bonus development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the
two-year period preceding the filing of the variance application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential development.
(1) Affordable housing developments shall be exempt from development fees. All other
forms of new construction shall be subject to development fees unless exempted below.

development fees.

on an unimproved lot or lots.

specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the increase in equalized
assessed value resulting from any additions to existing structures to be used for
nonresidential purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure is
demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5% shall be calculated on the
difference between the equalized assessed value of the preexisting land and
improvement and the equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e.,
land and improvement at the time final certificate of occupancy is issued. If the
calculation required under this section results in a negative number, the nonresidential
development fee shall be zero.

shall be subject to the 2.5% development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.

municipal government uses; churches and other places of worship; and public schools.

development fees in accordance with the exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.

shall be substantiated by that developer.
(5) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the nonresidential
development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 shall be subject to it at such time the basis
for the exemption no longer applies, and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event or after the issuance
of the final certificate of occupancy of the nonresidential development, whichever is
later.
(6) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a nonresidential development
fee thereafter ceases to be exempt from property taxation, the owner of the property
shall remit the fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the termination
of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential development fees under these
circumstances may be enforceable by the Borough of Oradell as a lien against the real
property of the owner.

A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval for a development,
the applicable approving authority shall direct its staff to notify the Construction Official

notifies the local Assessor of any and all requests for the scheduling of a final inspection
on property which is subject to a development fee.
F. Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final inspection, the Municipal
Assessor shall confirm or modify the previously estimated equalized assessed value of the
improvements of the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify the
developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should the Borough of Oradell fail to determine or notify the developer of the amount of
the development fee within 10 business days of the request for final inspection, the
developer may estimate the amount due and pay that estimated amount consistent with the
dispute process set forth in Subsection b of § 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).
H. Fifty percent (50%) of the development fee shall be collected at the time of issuance of the
