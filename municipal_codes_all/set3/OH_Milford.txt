ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 93-1473
 
   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
 
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Milford, Ohio, has determined the need
to recodify and revise the general and permanent ordinances of Milford; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council;
   Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Council of the City of Milford, Ohio:
   Section 1.  Pursuant to Milford Charter Section
12.08 and Ohio R.C. 731.23 and 731.42, the ordinances of the City of Milford,
Ohio, of a general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Milford, Ohio,
1992.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Milford,
Ohio.
   Section 2.  The provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and immediately
after passage of this Ordinance.  All ordinances and resolutions or parts
thereof which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances,
are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as
follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and modification.       
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease, or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way.
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to June 15, 1992.
   Section 3.  Any section of the Codified Ordinances without a legislative
history at the end thereof indicates that such section contains new matter
ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
   Section 4.  This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency ordinance
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health,
safety and welfare of the City and for the further reason that there exists an
imperative necessity for the earliest publication and distribution of the
Codified Ordinances to the officials and citizens of the City, so as to
facilitate administration and daily operation and avoid practical and legal
entanglements.  Therefore, this Ordinance shall be in full force and effect
from and after its passage by Council.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

lawfully be possessed or assumed by municipalities in the State of Ohio.
All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Charter, or

         B.   "Year" means twelve consecutive months.
            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from

are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is
closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for
doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

129.01  INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the City of Milford that openness leads to a better
informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public policy.
It is the policy of the City of Milford to strictly adhere to the state's
Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in their
narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid request
must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as outlined
in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the explanation must
also be in writing.
(Ord. 07-633.  Passed 11-7-07.)
129.02  PUBLIC RECORDS.
   This office, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records as
including the following: Any document - paper, electronic (including, but not
limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or received by, or comes
under the jurisdiction of a public office that document the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedure, operations, or other activities of
the office. All records of the City of Milford are public unless they are
specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (a)   It is the policy of the City of Milford that, as required by Ohio Law,
records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying (See Section
129.05 for the e-mail record policy). Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently.
      (Ord. 07-633.  Passed 11-7-07.)
129.03  RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records.  If
it is clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requestor does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record.  It is the office’s general policy that this
information not be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays.  Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer that 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows. (If more copies are requested, an
appointment should be made with the requestor on when the copies or computer
files can be picked up.)
      (2)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied (see
subsection (d)(1)) or be acknowledged in writing by the City of Milford within
three business days following the office's receipt of the request. If a request
is deemed significantly beyond "routine," such acknowledgment must include the
following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.  (Ord. 07-633.  Passed 11-7-07.)
129.04  COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is ten cents (10¢) per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is $1 per
disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requestors may ask that documents be mailed to them.  They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
      (Ord. 07-633.  Passed 11-7-07.)
129.05  E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic format are records as defined by the Ohio Revised
Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail is to be
treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should follow the
same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representative of this office are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (See Section
129.02  Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/
or to the office's records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
      (Ord. 07-633.  Passed 11-7-07.)
129.06  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS.
   The City of Milford recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of
failure to properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, the City of Milord's
failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering the City of
Milford to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney's fees and
damages.

133.01  AWARDING CONTRACTS TO LOWEST RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE BIDDER.
   The City shall award all contracts legally requiring competitive bidding to
the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in accordance with Ohio R.C.
9.312.
   (a)   Responsive Bidder.  A bidder on the contract shall be considered
responsive if his proposal responds to bid specifications in all material
respects and contains no irregularities or deviations from the specifications
which would effect the amount of the bid or otherwise give him a competitive
advantage.
   (b)   Factors to be Considered.  The factors to be considered in determining
whether a bidder on the contract is responsible include the experience of the

Position Audits and Classification Assignment
 
157.07  POSITION AUDITS.
   (a)   General.  The Civil Service Commission may initiate and make
continuing audits, inspections and investigations of the positions, offices and
departments.  Any employee or any appointing authority, desiring to submit
facts for consideration of the Commission shall be afforded reasonable
opportunity to do so in writing.  When the Commission finds that improper
classifications of positions exist, it may reallocate any position to the
appropriate classification as is necessary.
 
   (b)   Requests for Position Audits.  Any classified employee of the City may
request a review of the classification of his position.  An appointing
authority may request the Commission to review any position within his agency
for the purpose of determining whether the position is properly classified.
   The employee's written request shall include the employee's name, the name
of employing department, the office address and the name of his immediate
supervisor.
   The appointing authority request shall include the name of the employee
whose position is to be audited, the names of individuals to be interviewed,
the name of the person to contact to arrange any on-site audit, and a current
position description reflecting the duties currently being performed by the
employee.  A request from a department shall be signed by the appointing
authority unless the appointing authority has provided the Commission with a
letter designating the names of individuals authorized to sign for him.
 
   (c)   Audit Report Forms.  Upon receipt of an employee request for a
position audit, the Commission may forward audit forms for completion and, at
the same time, notify the affected agency of the audit request.  The notice
shall include a request to the appointing authority for a position description
reflecting the current duties and any comments concerning the duties of the
position.
 
   (d)   Submission of Forms.  The employee's audit report forms shall be
returned to the Commission within ten days of receipt.  The requested position
description, comments and other forms shall be forwarded to the Commission by
the appointing authority within ten days of receipt of the request.
   If the audit forms have not been returned by the appointing authority within
ten days, a second notice granting a five-day extension shall be sent to the
appointing authority.  If the second response is not answered, an on-site audit
shall be scheduled.
 
   (e)   Audits Requested by Employees.  Employee requests for position audits
shall be processed by the Commission without an on-site audit unless a
substantial conflict in submitted documentation is found.  The Commission may
resolve the conflict by requiring additional documentation or clarification. 
If the conflict is not clarified an on-site audit may be conducted.
 
   (f)   Audits Requested by Appointing Authorities.  Appointing authority
requests for position audits shall normally be scheduled for on-site audits.
 
   (g)   Determinations.  The audit findings shall be premised upon the
information and statements provided.  The information and statements submitted
shall be compared to the existing classification specifications.  The
classification which most accurately describes the duties performed shall be
assigned to the position.  The Commission may elect to develop a new
classification if no current classification accurately reflects the duties and
responsibilities of the position.
   The duties shall substantially satisfy the function statement and the job
duty ranks of the classification specification.  Other factors, including the
table of organization or comparable positions may be used to determine the
classification of a position and to distinguish among classifications.
 
   (h)   On-Site Audits.  At the time of an on-site audit, the employee, his
immediate supervisor and other persons as deemed necessary by the Commission,
shall be interviewed.  If any party refuses to attend on-site audit interviews
the Commission may render its decision on the information and documentation
submitted.
 
   (i)   Examination of Current Duties.  Position audits requested by an
employee shall examine the duties currently performed.  The audit report
reflects the duties at the time of the audit.
 
   (j)   Cancellation of Audit Requests.  Requests for audits shall be deemed
canceled if:
      (1)   The party requesting the audit submits a written withdrawal of the
request.  Audit requests may be withdrawn any time until the final notice of
classification is mailed;
      (2)   The employee requesting an audit fails to timely return the audit
report form; or
      (3)   The appointing authority fails to submit a position description
reflecting current duties, if the appointing authority requested the position
audit.
 
   (k)   Implementation of Audit Findings.  A position audit shall be deemed
completed when the Commission sends written notification of the results to the
employee and his appointing authority either by interdepartmental or United
States mail.
 
   (l)   Effective Date.  Whenever a position is reclassified by the
Commission, the employee's classification shall be changed.  The Commission
shall give to the affected employee and to his appointing authority a written
notice setting forth the proposed new classification.  The effective date of
such change shall be assigned by the Commission and shall be no more than
thirty days after notification of such determination.
 
   (m)   Submission of Documents to Implement Classification Change.  The
documents necessary to implement a classification change shall be submitted by
the appointing authority within thirty days after the notification of the
determination, unless the appointing authority or the employee appeals the
determination to the Commission.
 
   (n)   Appeal.  The decision rendered by the Commission on positions in the
classified service may be appealed to the Commission by the appointing
authority or the employee.  The appeal to the Commission shall be in accordance
with the rules set forth in these rules.
 
   (o)   Effective Date After Appeal.  Upon completion or review by the
Commission, the effective date of the classification change shall be the date
originally assigned by the Commission in its written notification.
 
   (p)   Audit Findings of a Lower Classification.  If the results of a
position audit indicate that a position would be properly allocated to a
classification with a lower pay range assignment than the classification
currently assigned, the Commission shall notify the appointing authority that
the appointing authority shall select one of the following options to be
initiated within thirty days of receipt of the notice:
      (1)   The employee shall be assigned duties which are commensurate with
the current classification assigned;
      (2)   The employee shall be offered the opportunity to voluntarily accept
a classification change to the lower classification (accompanied by a change in
compensation);
      (3)   The employee shall be assigned another position having the same
classification as the employee's current classification; or
      (4)   The appointing authority shall abolish the affected position
pursuant to the provisions of Sections
157.88 to
157.99.
 
   (q)   Audits of Positions of Incumbents Who Are Subject to Layoff or
Displacement.  Requests for audits of positions shall not be processed if the
position is classified in a classification that is designated for calculation
of retention points for purposes of a layoff or position abolishment under the
provisions of Sections
157.88  to
157.99 .  The date the lists of classifications are submitted to the Commission
for verification of retention points shall be the date the requests for
position audits are suspended.
 
   (r)   Effective Date of Amended Audit.  If for any reason, the results of a
position audit are amended, a corrective notice for a reclassification of a
position shall be made and the effective date of the reclassification shall be
the date indicated in the original letter of notification.
 
   (s)   Positions to Be Audited No More Than Once a Year.  Requests for audits
of a position, from either the incumbent or the appointing authority, may not
be submitted more often than once a year.

plan which would affect employees currently in the classification, the
Commission shall notify each affected employee and his appointing authority of
the proposed change.
 
   (b)   Notification.  The Commission shall determine the method of
notification of affected employees, which method may include notification on
the affected employee's earning statement or other appropriate means of
notification as determined by the Commission.

position classification, or refusal of the appointing authority, or anybody
authorized to perform his functions, to reassign an employee to another
classification or to reclassify his position pursuant to a job audit under
Section
157.07.  The Commission may affirm, disaffirm or modify the decisions of the
appointing authorities, and its decision is final.  The Commission shall not be
deprived of jurisdiction to hear an appeal due to the failure of an appointing
authority to file its decision with the Commission.  Any final decision of the
appointing authority not filed in the manner provided in these rules shall be
disaffirmed.

Department Head shall certify in writing to the City Manager the fact of the
suspension and an explanation of cause.  The City Manager, within five days
receipt of the statement of suspension, shall conduct an investigation as to
cause, and shall render judgment thereon.  During the investigation, the City
Manager shall have the power to administer oaths and secure the attendance of
witnesses and the production of books and papers.  Should the charge be
sustained, the judgment of the City Manager may be either suspension, reduction
or removal.  This decision may be appealed to the Commission pursuant to these
rules.

shall make an investigation, and if it finds that a violation of that chapter,
or the intent and spirit of that chapter has occurred, the Commission shall
make a report to the City Manager or other chief appointing authority, who may
remove forthwith such guilty officer, board, commission, head of department or

157.26  GENERAL APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Denomination of Parties.  The party filing an appeal is denominated
"appellant".  All other parties are denominated "appellee".
 
   (b)   Scheduling of Hearings.  The Civil Service Commission shall, within
ten calendar days of receipt of an appeal, notify the appointing authority and
the appellant that such appeal has been received, and shall forthwith hear, or
appoint a trial board, referee or examiner to hear such appeal within thirty
days from and after its filing with the Commission.
 
   (c)   Notice of Hearings.  Notice specifying the date and time set for an
initial hearing shall be mailed to the parties by ordinary U.S. mail at least
ten calendar days in advance of the hearing.
 
   (d)   Continuances.
      (1)   Upon its own motion or the motion of any party, the Commission may
continue a hearing.
         A.   Request for continuance shall be addressed to the Commission.
         B.   Request for continuance should be made, in writing, at least five
calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing date.
         C.   Each party shall contact all of the witnesses he has subpoenaed
and inform them of any continuance.
      (2)   Any appeal, based upon incidents which result in a criminal
prosecution, shall be continued on motion of the affected employee until a
verdict is rendered.  Similar continuances shall be granted an appointing
authority only if the affected employee consents in writing.
      (3)   Absent compelling circumstances, a hearing shall not be continued
due to the unavailability of a subpoenaed witness.  The Commission may hold the
record open or accept a testimonial deposition in lieu of oral testimony.  The
cost of testimonial depositions taken under this section shall be borne by the
party calling them.
 
   (e)   Consolidations.  If two or more appeals involve substantially
identical issues and parties, the Commission may consolidate them into a single
hearing in the interests of economy.
 
   (f)   Appearances.
      (1)   A party may represent himself or may be represented at any hearing
before the Commission by any representative who is authorized to appear on his
behalf.
      (2)   Provided a party has not been subpoenaed and has authorized his
representative to represent him in all facets at a hearing before the
Commission, that party is not required to personally appear at any hearing.
      (3)   Representatives shall enter their appearances in writing.  One who
has entered an appearance as a representative of a party is that party's
representative of record unless and until a written withdrawal is filed with
the Commission.
 
   (g)   Substitution of Parties.
      (1)   If an appellant dies during the pendency of an appeal, the executor
or administrator of his estate shall, upon motion, be substituted for him.  An
appeal shall be held open for a reasonable time to permit substitution of an
executor or an administrator.
      (2)   If the appointing authority changes during the pendency of an
appeal, the new appointing authority is automatically substituted and no formal
motion or order is required.
 
   (h)   Motions.
      (1)   All motions shall state, with particularity, both relief sought by
the moving party and the basis for granting such relief.
         A.   All motions together with supporting documentation, if any, shall
be served on the opposing party.
         B.   Motions to dismiss an appeal shall be supported by affidavits,
made on personal knowledge, setting forth facts as would be admissible in
evidence.  Affidavits shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to
testify to the matter stated therein.  Sworn or certified copies of all papers
referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto.  When a motion is made
and supported as provided in this section, an adverse party may not rest upon
mere allegations or denials.  An adverse party's response, by affidavit or
otherwise, shall set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue in
dispute.
      (2)   Procedural motions, not determinative of the final outcome of the
appeal, may be acted upon any time after receipt by the Commission without
awaiting a response from the opposing party.  The party adversely affected by
such action of the Commission may move for appropriate relief.
      (3)   Within ten calendar days of service of a nonprocedural motion, a
party shall serve a written response on the opposing party and file a copy of
that response with the Commission.  The Commission may rule on any
nonprocedural motion once the time to respond has run.  Upon motion of the
affected party, the Commission may extend the time to reply to a nonprocedural
motion.
      (4)   The Commission may rule on any nonprocedural motion at a record
hearing, even if ten calendar days have not elapsed since service.  Provided
the time for response to a nonprocedural motion has not run, an oral response
is acceptable at a record hearing.
 
   (i)   Briefs.
      (1)   At any time prior to the issuance of a final order and appeal, the

calendar days after service.
 
   (k)   Service.
      (1)   Any document required by this chapter to be served upon a party may
be served either personally or by mail.  Where a party is represented by a
representative who has entered an appearance, service shall be made upon that
representative.  Service is complete on the date mailing or personal
transmission of the document occurs.
      (2)   All motions and briefs shall contain the name, address and
telephone number of the person submitting the motion or brief.
      (3)   A motion shall be considered by the Commission only if a
certificate of service appears on it.  Any statement, signed by either the
moving party or his representative, is an acceptable certificate of service so
long as it contains all of the following information:

         B.   Method by which service was made;
         C.   Address where service was made; and

one person enters an appearance as a party's representative, communications
shall be sent as follows:

designated, in writing, to receive communications from the Commission, all
communications shall be sent to him.
      (2)   If no representative has been designated to receive communications
from the Commission, all communications shall be sent to the representative who
last entered an appearance.
      (3)   If it is impossible to determine who last entered an appearance,
all communications from the Commission shall be sent to the representative
whose name is first in alphabetical order.
 
   (m)   Computation and Extension of Time.
      (1)   The date of occurrence of the event causing time to run is not
counted in the computation of any time limit under this chapter.  The last day

manner, the Commission shall neither act to enforce its subpoena nor hold the
record open for the testimony of that witness should the witness fail to

the qualifications for the position are met.  Where a position is vacant for a
temporary period by reason of sickness or disability of a regular employee, and
the Commission is unable to certify from an eligible list for such temporary
period, interim provisional appointments may be authorized for the period of
sickness or disability.  Service as a provisional appointee shall count as part
of the probationary period.

competitive examination.  The competitive examination shall include, but not be
limited to, a written examination.

157.76  PROMOTION WITHOUT COMPETITION.
   If a vacancy exists in a promotional position, but it is determined by the
Civil Service Commission that it is not feasible to conduct an examination, the
Commission may authorize the appointing authority to nominate an eligible
employee for promotion without competition.  Such promotion without competition
shall be substantiated by written documentation from the appointing authority
showing that the duties performed by the person nominated have been in actual
preparation for the higher position, and that such person is entitled to
promotion by reason of effective performance and appropriate qualifications. 
Such promotion shall be deemed a provisional appointment subject to
displacement when a written promotional examination is given.

   (a)   Years of full-time continuous service with the City only based upon
one percentage (1%) point of the score received on the examination for each
full year of the first four years of full-time continuous service, and six-
tenths of one percentage (.6%) point of the score received on the examination
for each full year of full-time continuous service on the next ten years of
service; and
      (Ord. 95-1662.  Passed 11-7-95.)
   (b)   Credit for performance based upon determination of the average of each
candidate's three most recent performance evaluations and adding one-quarter
percent (1/4%) of the score received on the examination for each point above

results in the employee retaining his current status and classification.

provisions of these rules.
   (c)   An employee who chooses not to accept a classification change under
the provisions of this section shall notify the Civil Service Commission and

chapter, and who has temporarily separated from the service during the inactive

submitted with the list.
   (b)   The Commission shall verify the calculation of retention points of the
employees on this submitted list.

retention points shall be implemented.
   (d)   Personnel action forms and recall lists resulting from a layoff or
displacement shall be received by the Commission at least seven days prior to

157.96  DISPLACEMENT RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   Each employee laid off or employee whose position has been abolished,
or displaced as a result of a layoff, shall have the right to displace another
employee with the fewest retention points in the manner provided in this rule. 
Displacement rights of an employee may only be exercised within the employee's
appointing authority.
   (b)   An employee who is to be laid off may exercise his displacement rights
under the provisions of this chapter, or be laid off.  Displacement occurs the
date the employee is notified that another employee has exercised his right of
displacement, and that the employee with fewer retention points is to be
displaced.  A displaced employee may exercise a right to displace another
employee if such right to displace exists.  If the displaced employee does not
have the right to displace another employee, then the displaced employee shall

   (c)   Employees shall notify their appointing authority, in writing, of
their intention to exercise their displacement rights within five days of their
receipt of notice of layoff or displacement.
   (d)   Within the order of displacement set forth in this rule a laid off
employee exercising his displacement rights shall displace the employee with
the fewest retention points.  Employees shall only have the right to displace
employees with fewer retention points in the order established in Section
157.97.
   (e)   In no event shall a laid off provisional employee have the right to
displace a certified employee.
   (f)   No employee shall displace an employee for whose position or
classification there exists special minimum qualifications unless the employee
desiring to displace another employee possesses the requisite minimum
qualifications or bonafide occupational qualifications for the position or the
classification.  The special qualifications shall be established by a position
description for the position, by classification specification minimum
qualification statement, or by bonafide occupational qualifications for the
position(s) or classification.  The appointing authority shall be responsible
for establishing the necessity of special qualifications for a position.
   (g)   An employee exercising his displacement rights to a position or an
employee displaced as a result of a layoff or abolishment shall be paid
according to the pay range assigned to the classification into which the
employee displaced or was displaced.
(Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
157.97  ORDER OF DISPLACEMENT.
   Laid off employees and employees whose positions are abolished, and
employees displaced as a result of a layoff, who have the right to displace,
shall exercise their displacement rights in the following order:
   (a)   An employee who has the right to displace whose position is abolished
and who is to be laid off, may displace within his classification.  If the
employee exercises his right to displace within his classification, he shall
displace the employee with the fewest retention points in that classification.
   (b)   An employee who is to be laid off or displaced as a result of a layoff
may displace an employee with the fewest retention points in the next lower and
then successively lower classifications in the classification series.  This
process shall continue if necessary until the employee with the fewest
retention points in the lowest classification of the classification series has
been reached, and if necessary, laid off.
      (Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
157.98  REINSTATEMENT RIGHTS.
   (a)   Each appointing authority who has laid off employees shall prepare
recall lists of the names of the employees laid off.  The recall list shall be
compiled by the classifications in which the employees were laid off.  The
names of all laid off and displaced certified employees shall appear on one
list, and the names of all laid off and displaced provisional employees shall
appear on a second list.  The names shall be listed in descending retention
point order in each appointment category.  These lists shall be in reverse
order of the order of layoff as established in this chapter.  The recall list
shall contain the employee's name, type of appointment, retention points, and
date of commencement of continuous service.  In cases of identical retention
point ratings, the order of recall shall be the reverse order of the layoff. 
These recall lists shall be administered by the Civil Service Commission.
   (b)   An employee's name shall remain on the appropriate list for a period
of one year from the date of the job abolishment, layoff or date of
displacement from his original classification.
   (c)   The administration of the recall lists for reinstatement shall comply
with the following requirements:
      (1)   An offer to fill a vacancy that occurs in a classification series
shall be accepted in writing by the first person on the certified recall list
for that classification series for positions in classifications with pay ranges
equivalent to or lower than the classification from which the employee was laid
off or displaced before the next person on the recall list may be offered a
vacancy.  An offer to fill a vacancy shall be deemed to be declined if not
accepted in writing within five working days.
      (2)   After the certified recall lists for each appointing authority and
any eligible lists for that classification have been exhausted, the appointing
authority provisional recall list shall be used for purposes of reinstatement
as follows:
         A.   Vacancies occurring in the classification series for which a
recall list exists, shall be accepted in writing by the first person on the
provisional layoff list for that classification series for positions in
classifications with pay ranges equivalent to or lower than the classification
from which the employee was laid off or displaced from before the next person
on the list may be considered for reinstatement.  An offer to fill a vacancy
shall be deemed to be declined if not accepted in writing within five working
days.
   (d)   A laid off or displaced employee who chooses not to exercise his
option to displace shall only be entitled to reinstatement to the
classification from which the employee was laid off or displaced.
   (e)   Where an appointing authority has an employee on a recall list, the
appointing authority shall not hire, promote or transfer into the
classification or the classification series subject to the recall list except
as provided in subsection (c)(2) hereof.
   (f)   Any employee reinstated under this rule shall not serve a new
probationary period when reinstated; except any employee laid off or displaced
while serving an original or promotional probationary period shall begin a new
probationary period upon reinstatement.
(Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
157.99  APPEAL OF LAYOFF, ABOLISHMENT OR DISPLACEMENT.
   An employee may appeal a layoff, abolishment or a displacement which is a

filed or postmarked no later than ten days after the employee receives notice
of the layoff, abolishment or the date the employee is displaced.  An employee
shall be considered displaced the date the employee is notified that another
employee has exercised his right to displace an employee from his position.  An
appeal shall be made in accordance with the rules promulgated by the
Commission.
(Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
157.100  SEVERABILITY.
   Each rule of the Civil Service Commission and each section of each rule is
an independent rule.  The holding of any rule, chapter or section to be void,
invalid or ineffective for any reason does not affect the validity of any other
rule or section.
(Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
Tenure of Employees
157.101  REDUCTION, SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL.
   The tenure of every officer or employee in the classified service of the
City shall be during good behavior and efficient service and no such officer or

conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of
duty, violation of such sections or rules of the Civil Service Commission, or
any other failure of good behavior or any other acts of misfeasance,
malfeasance or nonfeasance in office.  A finding by the appropriate ethics
commission, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts alleged
in a complaint under Ohio R.C. 102.06 constitutes a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 102 may constitute grounds for dismissal.  Failure to file a statement
or falsely filing a statement required by Ohio R.C. 102.02 may also constitute
grounds for dismissal.
(Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
157.102  COPY OF REDUCTION, SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL ORDER.
   In the case of reduction, suspension of more than three working days or

157.103  POLICE DEPARTMENT SUSPENSION, DEMOTION OR REMOVAL.
   In the case of a suspension for any period of time, or demotion or removal
of a member of the Police Department, the appointing authority shall furnish
such member of the Department with a copy of the order of suspension, demotion
or removal which order shall state the reasons therefore.  Such order shall be
filed with the Civil Service Commission.
(Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
157.104  REFERRAL AS CHAPTER 24 ORDERS.
   Any orders affecting the tenure of any officer or employee as a result of
this chapter shall be referred as "Chapter 24 Orders".
(Ord. 92-1458.  Passed 10-6-92.)
Appeal Time Limits
157.105  TIME LIMITS FOR FILING APPEALS.
   (a)   Except as set forth below, appeals from Chapter 24 Orders shall be
filed, in writing, not more than ten calendar days after the filing of an order

begins to run from the date of receipt by the affected employee, not from the
date of filing with the Commission.
   (b)   Appeals from layoffs, job abolishments and transfers shall be filed in
writing, not more than ten calendar days after receipt of the notice of layoff,
job abolishment or job transfer.
   (c)   Appeals of all other actions shall be filed with the Commission not

thirty calendar days of the time he has actual notice of the action.

167.01  PROGRAM ADOPTED.
   (a)   The program for community reinvestment which shall be hereinafter
known and referred to as "City of Milford Program for Community Reinvestment"
is hereby adopted.  Such Program for Community Reinvestment is incorporated
herein in its entirety as if fully rewritten herein.
   (b)   In accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and pursuant to Resolution
277 passed May 6, 1986, and Ordinance 1059 passed May 20, 1986, Council hereby
adopts the following program for community reinvestment.
(Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-20-86.)
167.02  DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM.
   Ohio R.C. 3735.36 grants authority to Municipal corporations to create
community reinvestment areas.
   (a)   Taxes Which Continue in Force.  Taxes which are in force on real
property such as land and the buildings thereon, and which exist before any
improvements are made under a community reinvestment program, remain in effect
for that portion of the property for the life of any tax abatement program that
may be established.
   (b)   Improvements Eligible for Tax Abatement.  The following are the upper
time limits for tax abatement on real property improvements in a Community
Reinvestment Area which may be granted by Council:
      (1)   Up to ten years for existing one and two-family dwellings with
remodeling of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or more;
      (2)   Up to twelve years for existing dwellings of more than two units,
and existing commercial and industrial structures with remodeling of five
thousand dollars ($5,000) or more;
      (3)   Up to fifteen years for any new dwelling, commercial or industrial
building constructed.
The foregoing are the maximum number of years of tax abatement that may be
granted or negotiated by the approving authority at the time each reinvestment
area is established.  When the number of years of abatement is set for each of
the three improvement categories above, they remain fixed and are available to
all owners making such improvements within the reinvestment area.  The
approving authority, however, at the start of each program may also establish,
if it wishes, a lesser time period during which applications may be filed to
become eligible for the abatement.  Such periods for application eligibility
may later be extended, or renewed by the approving authority, subject to the
conditions of the law at that time.
   (c)   Program Study.  As the result of the establishment of community
reinvestment areas, current tax yields are never lost, reduced or abated. 
Within such reinvestment areas, property owners who are willing to improve
their property by either remodeling or new construction may receive a partial
tax set aside, or abatement, for a limited number of years.  This abatement
applies only to that increased tax yield from real property value which is the
result of encouragement of this Program.  All previously existing taxes,
including all personal property taxes, continue to flow, in full, as before.
      (Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-20-86.)
167.03  PURPOSE OF PROGRAM.
   The purpose of this Program is to spur the economic development or
redevelopment of identified areas which are lagging, deteriorating or depressed
to a degree that they no longer contribute satisfactorily to the economy and
well being of their neighborhood; or already are, or soon may, constitute a
material economic or social deficit to their surrounding community.
(Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-20-86.)
167.04  AUTHORITY FOR PROGRAM.
   Authority for this Program is contained in Ohio R.C. 3735.65 through 3735.70
entitled, "Community Reinvestment Areas".  Any such areas established in the
incorporated area of the City shall be by resolution of Council.
(Ord. 1059.  Passed 5-20-86.)
167.05  CRITERIA; EXPLANATION.
   Criteria have been established to identify possible areas to be designated
for community reinvestment and to evaluate the nature and degree of the benefit
to be gained by the City if tax abatement is made available under this
Program.  It is anticipated that this authority shall be used carefully by
Council, and shall be restricted to those cases which shall provide a
substantial benefit for a long term period.
   As a consequence, the deliberations leading to a creation of a Community
Reinvestment Area shall be thorough.  Since each candidate area and each
applicant shall have varying conditions unique to their particular
circumstances, the following criteria are selected as a check list and in order
to structure the deliberations.  They are not intended to be used as a weighted
scoring mechanism.  It is conceivable that under certain circumstances a single
strong adverse condition may constitute a sufficient reason not to so designate
a certain area or to deny tax abatement to a certain applicant.  On the other
hand, only two or three strongly favorable circumstances may weigh heavily
enough to properly merit the establishment of an area, or to grant abatement to
an applicant.
   In the following listings of criteria, groupings are solely in order to
facilitate the collection and analysis of information by subject areas in an
orderly fashion.  Relative positions of individual items in the list neither
connote priority consideration nor relative importance.
   (a)   Review Criteria for Establishing Community Reinvestment Areas
Preconditions.
      (1)   Identification of a delineated area which requires stimulus for
economic development.
      (2)   Provision of tax abatement as a precondition by a private company
to locate or to expand within the area.
      (3)   Determination of the lowest negotiable number of years of abatement
to conclude the inducement.
      (4)   Pre-arrangement among the applicant, the City and the State
Department of Taxation of determination, for tax assessment purposes, of all
major items, as being either real property or personal property, with the
determination to obtain for the length of the abatement period.
   (b)   Pertaining to the New Undertaking.
      (5)   A substantial number of new jobs shall be created.
      (6)   Significant local expenditures in addition to payroll shall be
made.
      (7)   The parent company is financially sound and reasonable.
      (8)   There is a forseeable long term demand for the product or the
service.
      (9)   The applicant provides descriptive plans, building and equipment
layouts, description of intended operations, products or services, and proposed
equity investment.
      (10)   An estimate of the increase of business for existing local service
industries and suppliers.
      (11)   An estimate of the requirement for establishment of new local
service industries and suppliers.
      (12)   The value-added rating of the industrial classification of the
applicant's product or service.
      (13)   Environmental effect on the surrounding community.
      (14)   Potential enhancement of the quality of life of the present
inhabitants by favorable attributes of the new work force.
      (15)   Accommodation by the master plan and zoning ordinances.
      (16)   Accommodation by local utilities and transportation.
      (17)   Accommodation by local schools, other functions of local
government, and various community services.
      (18)   Impact on the present housing supply, potential housing areas that
could be developed, and the housing industry.
      (19)   Nature and extent of the impact on the present labor force.

177.01  MONEYS FROM PERFORMING MARRIAGE SERVICES.
   The Mayor of Milford shall be entitled to personally receive and retain, as
his own, moneys gratuitously given to him for performing marriage services
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3101.08 and the City Charter.  Such moneys shall be
considered perquisites which the Mayor may accept personally rather than fees
accepted by a City representative to be paid into the Municipal treasury.  Nor

(Ord. 969.  Passed 10-2-84.)

Judge of the Milford Mayor's Court pursuant to and in accordance with Section

and affirm any and all lawful judicial activity of the Vice Mayor prior to the

(Ord. 90-1291.  Passed 1-16-90.)
177.03  COMPENSATION OF VICE MAYOR AS JUDGE.
   Compensation of the Vice Mayor shall be as provided in Section
 3.10  of the City Charter.
177.04  PROBATION.
   (a)   As Alternative to Immediate Imposition of Sentence; Criteria.
      (1)   Alternative.  The court may suspend a sentence of imprisonment or
fines or a portion of imprisonment or fines and place an offender on probation
as an alternative to immediate imposition of such sentence.
      (2)   Criteria.  In determining whether to suspend such sentence and
place an offender on probation, or whether to otherwise suspend an offender's
sentence, the court shall consider the risk that the offender will commit
another offense and the need for protecting the public from the risk, the
nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history, character and
condition of the offender.
   (b)   Conditions of Probation.  When an offender is placed on probation, or
when his sentence otherwise is suspended, the probation or other suspension
shall be at least on condition that, during the period of probation or other
suspension, he shall abide by the law and not leave the State without the
permission of the court or court officer, as defined in subsection (c) hereof. 
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender and insuring his
good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on the offender,
including, but not limited to, requiring the offender to make restitution for
all or part of the damage that is caused by his offense and for all or part of
the value of the property that is the subject of any theft offense, as defined
in Ohio R.C. 2913.01(K), that the person committed.  Compliance with the
additional requirements shall also be a condition of the offender's probation
or other suspension of sentence.
   (c)   Enforcement Personnel; Definitions.  As used in this section, the
following definitions shall apply:
      (1)   "Court officer" means any Clerk of Milford Mayor's Court.
      (2)   "Probation officer" means any police officer appointed by the court
to serve as probation officer for any probationer.
      (3)   "Court" when the context so implies, means the Mayor or Vice Mayor
sitting as Judge of Milford Mayor's Court.
   Any clerk or probation officer shall be competent to file a charge of
probation violation under this section.
   (d)   Stay to Pay Fines; Procedure.  The court may grant a stay to pay to
any offender against whom the court has levied a fine.  Any offender who
requests and is granted such a stay to pay may be placed by the court on
probation until the fine is paid in full as a minimum period of probation. 
Failure to pay the fine in full by the time the stay has expired constitutes a
probation violation.  The court officer shall file an affidavit and complaint
in Mayor's Court charging probation violation against any offender who fails to
comply with the terms of his/her stay to pay a fine.  Failure to pay any fine
in full by the time any stay granted has expired shall also subject the
offender to an additional fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
offense.
   (e)   Period of Probation.  Probation continues for such period as the court
determines, and may be extended.  The total period of probation shall not
exceed five years.  If the probationer absconds or otherwise absents himself
from the jurisdiction of the court without permission from the court officer or
the court to do so, or if he is confined to any institution for the commission
of any offense whatever, the probation period ceases to run until such time as
he is brought before the court for further action.
   (f)   Procedure Against Probationer When Probation Violation Charged.
      (1)   Any court officer or other person with first hand knowledge that a
probationer has violated any condition or conditions of his/her probation may
file an affidavit and complaint in Milford Mayor's Court charging such
violation.  Such probation violations chargeable by a court officer include,
but are not limited to, any subsequent criminal convictions.
      (2)   If a probationer is required to make restitution as a condition of
his/her probation and the probationer fails to make full restitution by the
deadlines imposed by the court, the person to whom restitution is owed and a
court officer may file joint affidavits charging such violation.
      (3)   When an offender on probation is brought before court for probation
violation(s), the court shall immediately inquire into the conduct of the
offender and may terminate the probation and impose any sentence which might
originally have been imposed or continue the probation and impose any
additional or revised conditions of probation on the offender at any time
during the probationary period.  When the ends of justice will be served and
the good conduct of the person so held warrants it, the court may terminate
period of probation.  At the end or termination of the period of probation, the
jurisdiction of the court to impose sentence ceases and the defendant shall
thereupon be discharged.
   (g)   Final Order.  An order suspending the imposition of sentence and
placing the offender on probation is a final order from which appeal may be
prosecuted.
(Ord. 91-1359.  Passed 2-19-91.)
177.05  CONTEMPT OF COURT.
   (a)   No person shall fail to appear in Mayor’s Court of the City at the
time and place on the date noted on a citation issued to such person for
violation of an ordinance of the City or a statute of the State.
   (b)   No person shall fail to appear in Mayor’s Court of the City at the
time and on the date noted on an arrest notice issued to such person subsequent
to his or her failure to appear as initially cited.
   (c)   If a defendant is given a stay to pay his or her fine, no such
defendant shall fail to appear and pay the fine on the stay date, unless the
fine has been previously paid.
   (d)   No person present in the courtroom or in areas adjacent to the
courtroom shall conduct themselves in such a manner so as to violate any of the
provisions of any of the ordinances of the City.
   (e)   This section creates an offense separate and apart from the offense
alleged in the legal process giving rise to the requirement to appear in
Mayor’s Court and is separate and apart from a lawsuit requirement to post
security to insure appearance before the Mayor’s Court and in no way excuses
the forfeiture of such security upon failure to so appear.
   (f)   Whoever violates subsections (a), (b) or (c) hereof shall be subject
to the penalties for a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file
a return or pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (f)    Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this Chapter.

furnished by or obtainable upon request for the Administrator setting forth:
   (a)    The aggregate amounts of income, salaries, wages, commissions and

federal schedules.
      (Ord. 04-346.  Passed 1-6-04.)
181.12  FILING EXTENSIONS.
   (a)    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal

taxpayer's request for a federal filing extension with the Administrator.
   (b)    Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing a City of Milford tax return in writing.
   (c)    The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last day
for filing the City of Milford tax return as prescribed by ordinance or rule of
this municipal corporation.
   (d)    A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
six months from the original due date of such return for taxable years prior to
2004. For taxable year 2004 the extended due date shall be the last day of the
month following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax
return has been extended. For taxable years subsequent to 2004 the extended due
date shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
   (e)    The City of Milford may deny a taxpayer's request for extension if
the taxpayer:
      (1)    Fails to timely file the request;
      (2)    Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
      (3)    Owes City of Milford any delinquent income tax or any penalty,
interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of
income tax;
      (4)    Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
   (f)    The granting of an extension for filing a City of Milford income tax
return does not extend the last date for payment of the tax; hence, penalty and
interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate
set out by Section
181.98. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Administrator shall be granted with the understanding that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.

to which the City is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have

shall be refunded provided that no additional taxes are owed. Balances or
overpayments of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be collected or
refunded.
   (c)    Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for a
refund is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or
the return was due, or within three months after final determination of the
federal tax liability, whichever is later.
(Ord. 04-346.  Passed 1-6-04.)
181.14  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    Where necessary an amended return shall be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
181.19. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (b)    Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon, or make claim for refund of any overpayment.  (Ord. 04-

Administrator, or on any acceptable generic form. Such employer, in collecting
the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same as trustee for the benefit of the
City until payment is made by such employer to the City, and any such tax
collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to
the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Such employer
shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (f)    All employers that provide any contractual service within the
Municipality, and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service,
shall provide the Municipality the names and addresses of the subcontractors.

withholding tax reconciliation for the preceding calendar year, showing the sum
total of all compensation paid to all employees, the portion of which, (if
any), was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for same, and
the portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the amount of
such withholdings remitted. Such return shall include information concurring
each employee from whom the City tax was withheld, or should have been
withheld, setting forth the name, address and social security number of each
such employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year, the
amount of the City tax withheld and such other information as may be required
by the rules and regulations established by the Administrator. In lieu of
submitting forms W-2 for each employee, an alternative method of reporting must
be approved by the Administrator, or his duly authorized agent.
   (h)    On or before February 28 of each year all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or other who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (those who are not
subject to withholding) must provide the City Income Tax Department with copies
of all 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses,
Social Security numbers and a total amount of earnings, payments, bonuses,
commissions and/or fees paid to each person.
   (i)    No person shall be required to withhold the tax on salaries, wages,
commissions, other compensation and other income paid domestic workers employed
by such person exclusively in or about such person's residence, even though the
residence is in the city, but such employee shall be subject to all of the
requirements of this chapter.

(Ord. 04-346.  Passed 1-6-04.)
181.17  ADMINISTRATOR DUTIES.
   (a)    Collection Responsibility. It shall be the duty of the Administrator
to receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from
the taxpayers; to keep an accurate record thereof; and to report all moneys so
received.
   (b)    Responsibility for Maintenance of Records. It shall be the duty of
the Administrator to enforce payment of all taxes owed the City, to keep
accurate records for a minimum of six years showing the amount due from each
taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or make any return, including taxes
withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of payment thereof.
   (c)    Enforcement Authority.   The Administrator is hereby charged with the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject
to the approval of the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce
rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the
collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of provisions of
this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination and correction of
returns. Taxpayers are hereby required to comply with said rules and
regulations.
   (d)    Authorization for Payment of Unpaid Taxes. The Administrator is
authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties
on a schedule of installment payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the
Administrator that, due to certain hardship conditions, the taxpayer is unable
to pay the full amount of tax due. Such authorization shall not be granted
until proper returns are filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by the
taxpayer under this chapter.  Failure to make any deferred payment when due,
shall cause the total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become
payable on demand and the provisions of Sections
181.19  and
181.99  shall apply.
   (e)    Determination of Taxes. In any case where a taxpayer has failed to
file a return or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of
the tax due, the Administrator may determine the amount of tax to be due the
City from the taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement
showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties
thereon, if any. Such determination may be modified or amended based upon
information or data subsequently secured by or made available to the
Administrator. If the taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment within 30
days, the tax, penalties, and interest assessed shall become due and payable
and collectible as are other unpaid taxes.
   (f)    Compromise Authority. The Administrator shall have the power to
compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed by Section
181.99 .
(Ord. 04-346.  Passed 1-6-04.)
181.18  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)    Examination of Taxpayer's Records. The Administrator, or any
authorized employee, is hereby authorized to examine the books, papers, records
and Federal income tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person
subject to, or whom the Administrator believes is subject to the provisions of
this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or
if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such
employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed
and required to furnish within ten (10) calendar days following a written
request by the Administrator, or the Administrator's duly authorized agent or
employee, the means, facilities and opportunity for making such examinations
and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    Appearance Orders to Taxpayer. The Administrator is hereby authorized
to order any person presumed to have knowledge of the facts to appear before
the Administrator and may examine such person, under oath, concerning any
income which was or should have been returned for taxation or any transaction
tending to affect such income, and for this purpose may compel the production
of books, papers, records and Federal and State income tax returns and the
attendance of all persons before the Administrator, whether as parties or
witnesses, whenever the Administrator believes such persons have knowledge of
such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)    Result of Refusal to Submit Information. The refusal to produce
books, papers, records and Federal and State income tax returns, or the refusal
to submit to such examination by any employer or person subject or presumed to
be subject to the tax or any officer, agent or employee of a person subject to
the tax or required to withhold tax or the failure of any person to comply with
the provisions of this section or with any order or subpoena of the
Administrator authorized hereby shall be deemed a violation of this chapter,
punishable as provided in Section
181.99 .
   (d)    Confidential Nature of Information. Any information gained as the
result of any returns, investigations, hearings or verifications required or
authorized by this chapter shall be confidential, except for tax official
purposes, or except in accordance with proper judicial order. Any person
divulging such information in violation of this chapter, shall upon conviction
thereof, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and may be
assessed such penalties, including fines and/or imprisonment, as the same are
set forth in Ohio R.C. 2929.21 and 2929.31, whichever may be applicable. In
addition to the above penalty, any employee of the City who violates the
provisions of this section relative to the disclosure of confidential
information shall be guilty of an offense punishable by immediate dismissal.
   (e)    Retention of Records.  Every taxpayer shall retain all records
necessary to compute their tax liability for a period of six years from the
date the taxpayer's return is filed, or the withholding taxes are paid.  (Ord.
04-346.  Passed 1-6-04.)
181.19  TIME LIMITATIONS; AMOUNTS.
   (a)    Suits. All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible,
together with any interest and penalties thereon, by a civil action at law. All
additional assessments shall be made and all civil actions to recover municipal
income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within three
years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later.
However, In the case of fraud, omission of 25% or more of income subject to
this tax, or failure to file a return, all additional assessments shall be made
and all prosecutions to recover Municipal income taxes and penalties and
interest thereon shall be brought within six (6) years after the tax was due or
the return was filed, whichever is later.
   (b)    In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the
taxpayer have executed a waiver of the Federal Statute of Limitations, the
period within which an additional assessment may be made by the Administrator
shall be one year from the time of the final determination of the Federal tax
liability.
   (c)    Refunds. Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim
for a refund is made. Claims for refund of municipal income taxes shall be
brought within the time limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof. However,
the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified
deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)    A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)    A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a
NDCP, and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP
and upon which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the
amount representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed
and the income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the
tax years in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates
will be used to compute the refund amount.
      (3)    Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
         (Ord. 04-346.  Passed 1-6-04.)
   (d)    Income tax that has been deposited with  the City of Milford, but
should have been deposited with another municipality or joint economic
development district, is allowable by the City of Milford as a refund but is
subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.  Income tax that should have
been deposited with the City of Milford, but was deposited with another
municipality or joint economic development district, shall be subject to
recovery by the City of Milford.  The City of Milford will allow a non-
refundable credit for any amount owed the City of Milford that is in excess of
the amount to be refunded by the other municipality or joint economic
development district, as long as the tax rate of the other municipality or
joint economic development district is the same or higher than the City of
Milford’s tax rate.  If the City of Milford’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by
the City of Milford.
(Ord. 07-570.  Passed 1-16-07.)
   (e)    Amounts. Amounts of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be
collected or refunded.

majority of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. The Board shall
adopt its own procedural rules and shall keep a record of its transactions.
   (b)    Appeals; Alternative Method of Allocation. All rules and regulations
and amendments or changes thereto, which are adopted by the Administrator under
the authority conferred by this chapter, shall be approved by the Board of
Review before the same becomes effective. The Board shall hear and pass on
appeals from any ruling or decision of the Administrator, and, at the request
of the taxpayer of Administrator, is empowered to substitute alternate methods
of allocation. Upon an appeal from the refusal of the Administrator to
recommend abatement of penalty and interest, the Board of Review may
nevertheless abate penalty or interest or both.
   (c)    (1)    Whenever the Administrator issues a decision regarding an
income tax obligation that is subject to appeal as provided in this section, or
in an ordinance or regulation of the City of Milford, the Administrator shall
notify the taxpayer at the same time of the taxpayer's right to appeal the
decision and of the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the decision.
      (2)    Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Administrator and
who has filed with the City of Milford the required returns or other documents
pertaining to the municipal income tax obligation at issue in the decision may
appeal the decision to the Board of Review by filing a request with the Board.
The request shall be in writing, shall state with particularity why the
decision should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within
thirty days after the Administrator has issued the decision.
      (3)    The imposition of penalty and interest as prescribed in the
codified ordinances of the City of Milford is not a sole basis for an appeal.
      (4)    The Board of Review shall schedule a hearing within forty-five
days after receiving the request, unless the taxpayer waives a hearing.
      (5)    If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant or other representative.
      (6)    The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Administrator's
decision or any part of that decision. The Board shall issue a decision on the
appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing on the appeal, and

days after issuing the decision.
      (7)    Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the Board
of Review may appeal therefrom to a court of competent jurisdiction as provided
by law within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the Board's ruling or
decision. For matters relating to tax years beginning on or after January 1,
2004, any ruling or decision of the Board of Appeal may be appealed to a court
of competent jurisdiction or to the State Board of Tax Appeals.
      (8)    The Board of Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (9)    Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Review created
pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to Section
121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code, and the provisions of Section
181.18 (d) with reference to the confidential character of information required
to be disclosed by this chapter shall apply.
   (d)    Law Director Duties. The City Law Director shall serve as legal
advisory to the Board.  (Ord. 04-346.  Passed 1-6-04.)

181.24  SAVING CLAUSE.

   Whereas, the Home Rule Amendment of the Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII,

powers of self-government", and the municipal taxing power is one of such
powers of local self-government delegated by the people of the State to the
people of municipalities; and
   (A)    Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)    As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-1199,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends the languages and code as set
forth in Chapter
181  and creates a newly enacted Chapter
182  in accordance with the provisions of Ohio Revised Code 718 to allow the
Municipality to continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and
collection efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
   (C)    Significant and wide-ranging amendments to the Ohio Revised Code 718
were enacted by Am Sub H.B. 49, passed by the 132nd General Assembly, and

effective January 1, 2018, comprehensively amends Chapter
182  in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to

on behalf of the Municipality. Under the Ohio Revised Code, section 718.80 to
718.95, businesses may elect to be subject to ORC 718.80 to 718.95 which will
designate the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner as the administrator of the
municipal net profit tax(es).
   (E)    The passage of Ordinance # 2018-1379, to amend Chapter
182 , does not waive any of the rights of the City, including, but not limited
to, the City reserving the right under its home rule powers to challenge Ohio
House Bill 49, including the amendments to Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
   (C)   (5)   (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the
amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been
paid;
   (C)   (5)   (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that

required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.

the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
   (E)   (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.

with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility
is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the

electronically with the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld
and that was not previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security
number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that
person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
   (E)   (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.

remit the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount
deducted and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any
penalty and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late
payment of tax deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
   (F)   (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
   (F)   (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

   (H)   (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted

annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not
filed or filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and
withheld at the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
   (A)   (2)   (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation

year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
   (B)   (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section
from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax

taxable years.

municipal corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation
income tax paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
of Milford for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.

deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.

the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
   (D)   (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
   (D)   (2)     The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the

the City of Milford shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or
withholding the City of Milford claims is due with respect to such income or
wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.

or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the

other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Milford's tax rate.

the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to

services within the City of Milford, make any sales in the City of Milford, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the City of Milford during the

of Milford for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer
and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City of Milford income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.

affidavit change.
   (H)   (3)   (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the
Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of Section 
182.051  of this Chapter.
   (I)   (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that date to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which
the report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
   (I)   (2)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.

examination or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's
refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors,
offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax
Administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person.
   Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax
Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax
Administrator from contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the City
of Milford in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the City of Milford or the Tax

meaning as in Section (C) of
182.052  of this chapter.
   (N)   (2)    A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a
taxable year if both of the following conditions apply:

municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
   (N)   (2)   (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
   (N)   (3)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.

of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the

(Ord. 18-1379.  Passed 6-19-18.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   A request for an extension of time to file should be made early with the
Internal Revenue Service. If the Internal Revenue Service denies your request,
then your return can be filed on time.
You may not be eligible for the automatic six month extension of time to file
if you are under a court order to file by the regular due date or you requested
the Internal Revenue Service to figure your tax.
   If filing a joint return, then either you or your spouse can qualify for the
automatic extension. If you and your spouse file separate returns, then the
automatic extension applies only to the spouse who qualifies for it. Under
Article XV Section 11 of the Ohio Constitution Individuals, who are not allowed
to use the filing status of "married filing jointly" or "married filing
separately" when filing an income tax return, the automatic extension applies
only to the individual who qualifies for it.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested and qualified for an automatic
six-month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return from
the Internal Revenue Service shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of the City of Milford's income tax return. The extended due date of the
City of Milford's income tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month
after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. 
   (A)   (1)   (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included
with the filing of the City of Milford's income tax return.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than the six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended  federal income tax return.
   (C)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a written
request  that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of
the date for filing the taxpayer's City of Milford income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date that the
City of Milford income tax return is due as prescribed by ordinance or rule of
this municipal corporation, and if the taxpayer qualifies for the extension,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this Chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If an extension is granted and a declaration of estimated tax is
required, payments are expected in a timely and quarterly manner as prescribed
in this Chapter.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Milford in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (G)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of the City of Milford's income tax return. The extended due date of the
City of Milford's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date
of the state income tax return. 
(Ord. 18-1379.  Passed 6-19-18.)
182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    Where necessary an amended return shall be filled in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and for limitations contained in this
Chapter.
   A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment of net
profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (A)   (1)    A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator on such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this Chapter must be altered.
   (A)   (2)    Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any
federal or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax
liability, that taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return
showing income subject to the municipal income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax liability, and pay any additional
municipal income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is ten ($10.00) dollars or less.
   (A)   (3)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
($10.00) dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless:
   (B)   (1)   (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all
facts, figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,

actions or prosecutions under Section
182.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
   (B)   (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of
tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
this Section
182.19  of this Chapter for filing the amended return, even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten
($10.00) dollars, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer.
Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations
only to those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
182.096  of this Chapter.
Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, the request shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return.
   (C)   (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 18-1379.  Passed 6-19-18.)
182.096 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is entitled
under the provisions of the chapter may have such overpayment applied against
and subsequent liability hereunder, or, at the taxpayer's election indicated on
the return, such overpayment shall be refunded provided that no additional
taxes are owed.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
   (A)   (1)    Overpayments that exceed more than ten dollars ($ 10.01);
   (A)   (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds more
than ten ($ 10.01) dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.
Failure to remit all documentation including schedules, other municipal income
tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits,
income, losses or other pertinent factors on the return, will cause delay in
processing, and / or the disallowance of undocumented credits or losses.
   (B)   (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)

denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.

request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18  of this Chapter.

date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within

   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in division (A)(4) of Section
182.10 of this Chapter.

provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment over-time agreement. (Ord. 18-1379.  Passed
6-19-18.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.    
   (A)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.

Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or

who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 18-1379.  Passed 6-19-18.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION.
   (A)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from

provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security

requested by the Tax Administrator, A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect

   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10  of this Chapter in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section

   (B)   (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10  of this Chapter

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

182.16  REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations as to whether or how
certain income, source of income, or a certain activity or transaction will be

(Ord. 18-1379.  Passed 6-19-18.)
182.17  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   As used in this section:
   (A)   (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
"Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
   With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   Such alternative delivery method must be authorized by the person subject to
the assessment.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the Ohio Revised Code. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new
last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
   (C)   (1)   (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other municipal official,
or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty (60) days
after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (C)   (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an address
with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
   (D)   (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within
sixty (60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other
City of Milford municipal official, or the designee of either, with the person.
Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from
entering into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file
such an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall apply.
(Ord. 18-1379.  Passed 6-19-18.)

dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.  The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (i)   “City” means the City of Milford, Ohio.  (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-

185.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   Commencing on January 1, 1999, there is hereby levied an excise tax of
three percent (3%) on all transactions by which lodging by a hotel or motel is
furnished to transient guests.
   (b)   Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City.  The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid.  If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment.  The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the
hotel.  If for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel, the Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the
Administrator.  (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.03  EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
   (a)   Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
constitutional laws of Ohio or the United States;
   (b)   Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions;
   (c)   Upon rents of two dollars ($2.00) a day or less.
   No exemption claimed under subsections (a) or (b) hereof shall be granted
except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under
penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Administrator.  All claims of
exemption under subsection (c) hereof shall be made in the manner prescribed by
the Administrator.  (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.04  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.05  REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within
thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any
hotel renting lodging to transient guests shall register such hotel with the
Administrator and obtain from him a “Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate” to be posed at all times in a conspicuous place on the premises. 
Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel;
   (c)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (d)   “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the
purpose of collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the Administrator.  This certificate does not constitute
a permit.”
      (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Administrator, make a return to the
Administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies.  All claims
for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during the
reporting period shall be filed with the report.  At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Administrator.  The Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for
any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection
of the tax and he may require further information in the return as such
information is pertinent to the collection of the tax.  Returns and payments
are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.  All taxes
collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the
account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Administrator.  All
returns and payment submitted by each operator shall be treated as confidential
by the Administrator and shall not be released by him except upon order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States,
the State, the County, or the City for official use only.  The nonavailability
or failure to obtain forms shall not relieve an operator from timely paying
such tax.
(Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.07  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent (10%)
of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Fraud.  If the Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due  under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Interest.  In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (d)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal.  No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section
181.08  nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board of Review provided
for in Section
181.09 .
   (e)   Abatement of Interest and Penalty.  In cases where a return has been
filed in good faith and an assessment has been paid within the time prescribed
by the Treasurers, the Administrator may abate any charge of penalty or
interest or both.
(Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in
such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Administrator procures such
facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment
of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed
or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and
penalties provided for by this chapter.  In case such determination is made,
the Administrator shall file a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.  Such
operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make
application in writing to the Administrator for a hearing on the amount
assessed.  If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the
Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable.  If such application is made, the Administrator shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.  At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax
interest and penalties should not be so fixed.  After such hearing, the
Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.  The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an
appeal is taken as provided in Section
185.09. (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.09  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by the decision of the Administrator with respect to
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, of any, may appeal to the Board
of Review by filing a notice of appeal with them within fifteen days of the
serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.  The Board of Review shall
fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing
to such operator at his last known place of address.  The findings of the Board
of Review shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant
in the manner prescribed in Section
185.08  for service of notice of hearing.  Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.  (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed
9-1-98.)
185.10  REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof provided a claim in writing therefor stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Administrator within three years of the date of payment.  The
claim shall be on forms furnished by the Administrator.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient guest to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only
when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to
the satisfaction of the Administrator that the transient guest has been unable
to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.11  RECORDS.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
of the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three yeas, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the
City, which records the Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all 
reasonable times.  (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.12  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provision of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.  Any
such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be
deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City.  Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.13  SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, such
decision shall not affect the invalidity of the remaining portions of this
chapter or any part thereof.  The Council hereby declares that it would have
passed each section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections,
paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional.  (Ord.
98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)
185.14  MONEYS CREDITED TO GENERAL FUND.

to the General Fund of the City.  (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)

   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required
herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses
to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Administrator,
or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a
misdemeanor, and is punishable as provided in Section
185.99 .  Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or
claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due
required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is
punishable as aforesaid.  (Ord. 98-1905.  Passed 9-1-98.)

   (b)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed

pay the tax due thereon, the Tax Administrator may require such operator to
furnish security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the
operator for a period of one year, as determined by the Tax Administrator from
a review of returns or other information pertaining to such operator, which
amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00).  Such

corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided by
this chapter.  (Ord. 2000-25.  Passed 4-18-00.)

within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax
or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall
proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and

become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable.
   (b)   If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such

interest, and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax
Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted, and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of

Tax Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Board of Review
within 30 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The
Board of Review shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall
give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known resident
address. The findings of the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive, and

notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable on service of the notice.  (Ord. 2000-25.  Passed 4-18-00.)

transaction.
   (b)   All such records and other documents shall be open during business

period of four years, unless the Tax Administrator consents in writing to their
destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. 
(Ord. 2000-25.  Passed 4-18-00.)
187.10  REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded, provided a claim
in writing therefor, stating under penalty or perjury the specific grounds on

from the Tax Administrator showing that the taxes have been paid or a
certificate that no taxes are due.
   (b)   If the purchaser of a business shall fail to withhold purchase money
as above provided, and the taxes so collected shall be due and unpaid after a

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.

storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
         A.   It is located within twenty-five linear miles of the location of
the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
   (b)   (1)   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the  transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section.  The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section;
         C.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed forty-five days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section.
      (2)   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101.
      (4)   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or

storage facility prior to the date the lienholder received the notice sent
under subsection (f)(1)A. of this section;

vehicle all photographs taken under subsection (d) of this section.  Upon
request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle

vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (4)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.

   (EDITOR’S NOTE:  The provisions of former Section
303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC  PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

while such officer is attempting to arrest offenders under the provisions of
this Traffic Code.  No person shall interfere with any person charged under
such sections with the enforcement of the law relative to public streets and
highways.  (ORC 4513.36)
   (b)   Whoever violates Section
303.12 is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree.
303.98  CITATION TAG; WRITTEN PLEA OF GUILTY.

any provision of any of the sections of this Traffic Code and who, upon
presenting such citation tag, files a written plea of guilty with the Clerk of
Courts or Mayor, and deposits with that official the amount of the penalty as
indicated in a schedule of fines and costs as set forth by the Mayor subject to
the limitations of the Traffic Code, shall be fined.
   (b)   The court shall have power to accept such plea, or to reject it and
hold the case for trial.  If such plea is accepted, the penalty deposit shall
be paid to the court, except that the court shall have no power to remit or
suspend it or any part of it.

operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
313.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does  not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.

person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.

violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and

E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender

subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the

program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the

consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or

The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under
Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  The court may grant unlimited driving
privileges with an ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may
reduce the period of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.  If the

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol

any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.

operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s

   (o)   Conflict of Terms.  All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.

or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially

more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY HELD BY POLICE DEPARTMENT; WRITTEN INTERNAL
CONTROL POLICY; RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.
501.14  CONSPIRACY.

commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section

545.15 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the

729.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)    Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses
in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the City, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse
secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of
this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter
to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   (b)     Findings.  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of

Nevada (1978); Cattaraugas County, New York (1998); Cleburne, Texas (1997);
Dallas, Texas (1997); El Paso, Texas (1986); New York Times Square Study
( 1994); Report to Aclj on the secondary impacts of sex oriented businesses
(1996); the findings from the report of the Attorney General's working group on
the regulation of sexually oriented businesses (June 6, 1989, State of
Minnesota), various police reports, testimony, newspaper reports and other
documentary evidence, the Council finds:
      (1)    Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)    Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)    Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      (4)    Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)    Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      (6)    At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
      (7)    According to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an
estimated 650,000 to 900,000 Americans are infected with HIV. The number of new
HIV infections occurring each year is now about 41,000. Men and women of all
races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
      (8)   A total of 10,255 AIDS cases has been reported in Ohio as of
January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and shows 7969
people living with HIV (4,213) and AIDS (3,756) in the State.
      (9)   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as
many as 1 in 3 people with HIV do not know they are infected.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts,
see, e.g. findings of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films.
      (16)   The findings noted in subsection (b)(1) through (15) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.

harmful vapors or debris.
   (c)   Water meters are registered to the property and not to its occupant. 
Water meters may not be moved by anyone without prior authorization of the
Director.
   (d)   The general policy of the City is to have one meter for each separate
service connection; if, in the opinion of the Director, more than one meter is
necessary to meter water supply to a property, such as multi-family units, the
meter shall be set in an area not under the control of any tenant and shall be
accessible at all times to utility personnel.  Meters shall not be installed in
such a manner as to require subtraction of another's meter reading to determine
usage for any consumer.
   (e)   When a property, provided with a service connection, is subdivided the
service connection shall be considered as belonging to the property for which
the water meter has been assigned.  If a water meter has not been assigned the
service connection shall be considered as belonging to the lot or parcel
closest to it.

reason deemed necessary and related to utility business by the Director of the
Water Department.
   (a)   All costs associated with the repair or replacement of a water meter
shall be borne by the Department unless the repair or replacement is occasioned
by neglect or carelessness of the property owner, his agent or tenant; an
example of neglect or carelessness would be the freezing of a water meter due
to inadequate insulation.
   (b)   The Department is not responsible for the failure of the inlet or
outlet plumbing for any meter setting even if such plumbing fails during the
repair or replacement of the meter.  If the Department is unable to effect
repairs or replacement of a water meter due to defective plumbing the Director
shall inform the property owner of his responsibility to effect repair of the
plumbing within a timely manner.  Failure to effect the necessary plumbing
repairs within the specified time may result in the disconnection of water
service.
   (c)   The Department reserves the right upon inspection to repair or replace
any water meter currently in service.  The Department reserves the right upon
inspection to require a larger or smaller water meter to be installed if the
installation of a re- sized meter is deemed to be in the best interest of the

meter shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the Water Department and
adjustments in past utility charges may be considered by the Finance Director.
   (a)   The Department reserves the right to remove and test any water meter
which, in the opinion of the Director of the Water Department, is not
accurately measuring the water supplied to the property.  All costs associated
with Department initiated testing shall be borne by the Department.
   (b)   If a tested meter, regardless of who initiates the request for such
testing, reveals damage resulting from neglect or carelessness of the property
owner, his agent or tenant, the total cost associated with the meter testing
and its subsequent repair or replacement shall be borne by the property owner.
   (c)   Water meter testing shall be done by the Department or by the
manufacturer's representative and the results of all tests shall be certified
in writing to the property owner along with the assessment of applicable
charges.

Utility Clerk shall estimate usage based upon prior usages and issue a utility
bill based on that estimated usage.
   (a)   When a meter reading shall be estimated for two or more billing
periods the difference between the estimated usage and the actual usage as
certified by a meter reading may be significant; therefore, the property owner,
his agent or tenant is encouraged to provide access to the meter reader or to
request the installation of a remote recorder meter.  In any event, the
property owner shall be responsible to pay the utility bill regardless of the
impact exerted by the estimation of usage bill on subsequent utility bills.
   (b)   When a meter reader is unable to obtain a meter reading from an inside
meter setting after two consecutive meter reading periods or if the remote
recorder has malfunctioned and access cannot be gained for repair of the
recorder for a similar time period, the Director of the Water Department shall
certify in writing to the affected property owner the necessity of providing
access to the meter for reading and/or repair.  If the property owner ignores
the notice requesting access to the water meter the Director may authorize the
disconnection of water service following a seven day period after the issuance
of the certified letter to the property owner.  Water service shall not be
reconnected until the Water Department personnel have been granted access to
the water meter for reading and/or repair and until the payment of a
reconnection fee has been received by the Utility Office.
      (Ord. 91-1404.  Passed 11-5-91.)
   (c)   When meters fail to register properly an estimated bill for water and/
or wastewater services shall be issued based upon previous usage.
      (Ord. 92-1454.  Passed 8-4-92.)
921.42  DISPUTED BILLS.
   As a general policy all utility bills, disputed or not disputed, are to be
paid in full on or before the due date printed on the face of the utility bill.
   (a)   A property owner has the right to appeal a billing considered to be
inaccurate or in dispute by following the procedural guidelines listed below:
      (1)   The property owner shall notify the Utility Office within ten days
of the billing date, in writing, of the precise nature of the dispute.
      (2)   The Utility Clerk shall review the account and in consultation with
the Director of the Water Department determine a resolution of the disputed
billing; a written notice of the review and resolution shall be sent to the
affected property owner.
      (3)   The property owner may appeal the review and resolution of the
Utility Office to the City Manager; the City Manager or his designee shall
review the disputed billing and make a final determination.
      (4)   Once a final determination has been rendered by the City Manager or
his designee a written notice stating same shall be issued to the affected
property owner and the bill shall no longer be considered in dispute and the
particulars of the final determination shall be in force.
      (5)   When a disputed bill is being appealed by the property owner the
water service shall not be disconnected; should the utility bill remain unpaid
after the imposition of a final determination the water service shall be
disconnected for nonpayment.
      (6)   During the appeal process the City reserves the right to waive or
to impose a late charge fee and shall determine same on a case by case basis.
   (b)   Only two appeals of utility service charges shall be permitted during
any calendar year and the Water Department reserves the right to impose charges
or fees for a second appeal should the second "unjustified" appeal for the
year.  The charges or fees that may be imposed shall cover the administration
costs associated with the second appeal.
      (Ord. 91-1404.  Passed 11-5-91.)
921.43  RETURNED CHECKS.
   As a general policy, the Finance Director shall establish a fee amount to be
paid by the affected party for a check returned to the Utility Office by the
bank for insufficient funds or for other reasons which prevent the honoring of
the check.
   (a)   The actual amount for the returned check fee shall be posted
conspicuously at the pay window of the Utility Office; the amount may be
obtained by calling the Utility Office Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.
   (b)   Failure to pay in full the utility bill, returned check fee and any
applicable late charges shall result in the disconnection of water service and
the commencement of appropriate legal action for the issuance of a bad check.
   (c)   The City reserves the right to waive legal action for a returned check
based upon a mediation of circumstances; however, the affected party shall pay
in full the utility bill, returned check fee, applicable late charges and a
reconnection fee if the water service was disconnected for non-payment.
      (Ord. 91-1404.  Passed 11-5-91.)
921.44  FINAL BILLING.
   When a property owner or his agent issues a request to the Utility Clerk for
the disconnection of water service the Utility Clerk shall issue a work order
specifying same; Water Department personnel shall read the water meter and
disconnect the water service by placing the curb box valve in the off position
or by placing the valve on the inlet side of the water meter in the off
position.  The property owner or his agent shall be present on the premises
when the water is disconnected to certify that the water is indeed off.
   (a)   Water service may be disconnected upon the request of the property
owner or his agent and all such requests shall be directed to the Utility Clerk
at the Utility Office during normal working hours.
   (b)   The property owner shall be responsible for payment of the final
utility bill which shall be issued during the regularly scheduled billing
period; under special or unusual circumstances the Finance Director may direct
the Utility Clerk to issue a "hand bill" in advance of the regularly scheduled
billing period.  The property owner remains responsible to the Utility Office
to supply forwarding addresses or to indicate any changes that might affect the
billing procedures.
   (c)   A request for new utility service shall not be honored by the City if
the property owner requesting such service is delinquent in the payment of a
utility bill, final or otherwise, or is indebted to the Department in any
manner.
   (d)   A disconnection of water service fee shall be charged to the property
owner requesting a final billing and that fee shall appear on the final bill. 
The fee shall cover the cost to the Department for the disconnection of service
and the fee may be repeated if the property owner fails to appear for such
service.
      (Ord. 91-1404.  Passed 11-5-91.)
921.45  MISCELLANEOUS CHARGES AND FEES.
   Miscellaneous charges and fees for various services performed by the Water

925.21  INDUSTRIAL WASTE PRETREATMENT PROGRAM (IWPT) PURPOSE.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sanitary sewer system which contain substances or possess
characteristics which, in the opinion of the Director of the Wastewater
Department, may have a deleterious effect upon the treatment facility,
processes, equipment, receiving waters, including violations of applicable
water quality standards or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the Director may:  reject the waste; require
pretreatment to an acceptable level for discharge; require control over the
quantities and rates of discharges; and/or require the payment of a surcharge
to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes under the
provisions of these Rules and Regulations and in accordance with U.S. E.P.A.
pretreatment regulations as described in 40 CFR, Subchapter N, parts 400, et
seq.  The industrial waste pretreatment program shall hereinafter be referred
to as the IWPT program.  No provision of this section shall be construed as
authorizing a variance from the provisions of the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards.
   (a)   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sanitary sewer system
shall, as a minimum, meet the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards or
best practical control technology currently available for incompatible
pollutants as published in CFR Title 40, Part 128, unless the treatment plant
is committed in its NPDES permit to remove a specified percentage of the
incompatible pollutants.  In those instances, the applicable pretreatment
standards may be correspondingly reduced by the Director or OEPA.
   (b)   If the Director permits or requires pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of facilities and equipment shall be
subject to review and approval of the Director, City Engineer and OEPA.  When
such facilities are provided they shall be constructed, operated and maintained
at the owner's expense.  Further, the facilities shall be maintained in
satisfactory and effective condition by the owner in accordance with all
applicable specifications, ordinances, laws and with the particulars of 40 CFR,
40.3.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.22  AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH AN IWPT PROGRAM.
   These Rules and Regulations incorporate provisions constraining the nature
and concentration of materials that may be discharged into the City's system
for the following reasons:  to protect public health, safety and general
welfare; to protect the physical integrity of the public sanitary sewer system
and treatment plant; to maintain optimum wastewater treatment process
efficiencies and over-all performance; and to prevent the introduction of
pollutants into the City's system which are incompatible with the treatment
processes and which would either interfere with the process or pass through the
process unchanged to the detriment of the environment.
   (a)   Should there be any inconsistencies between the requirements of these
Rules and Regulations and the Federal Regulations (40 CFR), a discharger shall
be required to meet the more stringent standards.
   (b)   Prior to or subsequent to the promulgation of these Rules and
Regulations, industrial waste dischargers shall be required to comply with any
revisions to the aforementioned standards (40 CFR).  It shall be the
responsibility of the discharger to remain informed and to implement the
provisions of any revisions of Federal or State regulations regarding their
waste discharges.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.23  SEWERAGE PARAMETERS DESCRIPTIONS.
   Normal strength sewage (also known as domestic wastewater or domestic
sewage), compatible pollutants and incompatible pollutants comprise the basic
description of wastes received at the treatment plant.  The imposition of an
IWPT program shall be based upon the compatible and incompatible pollutants as
they relate in character and concentration to normal strength sewage.
   (a)   Normal strength sewage shall mean sewage having average concentration
values of not more than the following in the indicated pollutant categories:
      (1)   BOD5 - 200 mg/l;
      (2)   Suspended solids - 250 mg/l;
      (3)   Total phosphorus as "P" - 15 mg/l;
      (4)   Total nitrogen as "N" - 20 mg/l; and
      (5)   Oil and grease in less than floatable amounts and biodegradable.
   (b)   Compatible pollutants shall mean BOD5, suspended solids, pH, fecal
coliform bacteria and other pollutants that may be identified by the Director
of the Wastewater Department if the treatment plant, in fact, does remove such
pollutants to a substantial degree.  The term substantial degree is not subject
to a precise definition but generally contemplates removals on the order of
eighty percent (80%) or greater.  Incidental removals in the range of ten
percent (10%) to thirty percent (30%) are not considered substantial.  Examples
of other pollutants that may be added to the list of compatible pollutants are
COD, total organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds.
   (c)   Incompatible pollutants are materials that shall not be discharged
into the public sanitary sewer system above the concentrations indicated by
maximum Allowable Headworks Loading determined by analysis on the wastewater
plant.
   (d)   In addition to the above referenced maximum concentrations in
subsections (a) through (c) hereof for the specified pollutants the following
compatible pollutants may not be discharged into the public sanitary sewer
system above the indicated concentration levels except by special written
permission of the Director:
 
(1)   BOD                  1000 mg/l
(2)   Suspended solids     1250 mg/l
(3)   Ammonia nitrogen     50 mg/l
(4)   Oil and grease
   mineral origin          10 mg/l
   animal or vegetable orig50 mg/l
         (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90; Ord.  00-46.  Passed 8-1-00.)
925.24  IMPOSITION AND BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF AN IWPT PROGRAM.
   If, in the opinion of the Director of the Wastewater Department or OEPA,
excess concentrations of the aforementioned pollutants could cause operation
and maintenance problems with the sewerage system, pretreatment shall be
required prior to discharge of industrial wastes into the system.  The degree
of pretreatment shall be specified via a special written permit issued by the
Director to the discharger; the permit shall contain pertinent information on
the acceptable concentrations of specific pollutants, required remedial
action.  The manner in which such pretreatment is achieved and the total cost
attendant to such activity shall be borne by the industrial discharger.
   (a)   Water and waste that have not been identified in these Rules and
Regulations as being unsuitable for discharge into the City's system may be
discharged provided the volume of flow of the acceptable waste materials are
not detrimental to the sewerage system.  Control of the Director over the
discharge of acceptable water and waste materials shall include wastewater
having high concentrations of BOD5, suspended solids, ammonia and phosphorus;
the admission into the City's system of any water or waste materials having
concentrations of any acceptable pollutants over those concentrations normal to
domestic wastewater as specified in Section
925.23(a) through (d), shall be subject to review and approval of the Director.
   (b)   When excessive concentrations of specified pollutants, see Section
925.23, are permitted to be discharged into the public sanitary sewer system,
the discharger shall be required to pay a surcharge for the collection and
treatment of these excessive materials to off set the added cost to the City of
such handling and treatment.
   (c)   The Director may require the discharger to control the quantities and
rates of discharge of water and waste should they constitute a slug flow and,
in the opinion of the Director, have a detrimental effect on the sewerage
system.
   (d)   When required by the Director, the owner of any premises served by a
sewer service connection carrying high strength wastes, slug flows, industrial
wastes or other potentially detrimental water and wastes shall install an
approved control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling and flow measurement.  The manhole shall be readily accessible and
constructed in accordance with the specifications of the City.  The manhole
shall be installed, maintained or replaced at the owner's expense but shall be
under the control of the Director.
   (e)   All flow measurements, tests and analysis of water and wastes
referenced in this section shall be determined by an OEPA approved lab in
accordance with Standard Methods and Federal regulation 40 CFR 135 and shall be
determined at the control manhole or upon the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sanitary sewer system at which the building's service connection is
tapped.  Sampling methods, times of sampling, duration of sampling and
frequency of sampling are to be determined on an individual basis subject to
the approval of the Director.
   (f)   For the purpose of establishing the appropriate surcharge and to
ascertain pretreatment compliance, the Director shall have the option of
sampling and testing a wastewater and billing the discharger for such sampling
and testing; or, the Director may require the discharger to perform a regular
sampling and testing program at the discharger's expense.  The discharger shall
be required to make all data pertaining to such sampling and testing available
to the Director or his designee upon request.  The Director reserves the right
to sample and test the wastewater to verify the accuracy of the discharger's
data.
   (g)   In addition to surcharges and fees for collection and treatment of an
industrial wastewater, each discharger shall be charged for the cost of any
special sampling or testing performed by the Wastewater Department in
accordance with the fee schedule established by the OEPA for specialized
testing at an approved lab.
   (h)   No statement in this section shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the Department and an industrial
discharger whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the Director for treatment subject to all rates, surcharges and
provisions of these Rules and Regulations.
   (i)   Any industrial discharger may appeal to the City Manager any
determination made by the Director in the implementation and enforcement of the
particulars of this section.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.25  NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Upon promulgation by the U.S. E.P.A. of a particular industrial subcategory,
the categorical standards and requirements thereof shall immediately supercede
any less stringent limits imposed by these Rules and Regulations.
   (a)   The Director of the Wastewater Department shall endeavor to make
timely notification of such U.S. E.P.A. actions as referenced above to all
dischargers who may be affected thereby.
   (b)   All affected industrial dischargers are, regardless of prior
notification or the absence thereof, required to comply with any newly
developed subcategory standards and any applicable reporting requirements
attendant to same.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.26  RESPONSIBILITIES OF DISCHARGERS SUBJECT TO AN IWPT PROGRAM.
   The Director of the Wastewater Department shall issue orders, as needed, to
notify dischargers of their responsibility to comply with these Rules and
Regulations, State or Federal pretreatment regulations or to cease and desist
from discharging substances which, in the opinion of the Director or OEPA, are
adverse to human health, safety or general welfare.
   (a)   Industrial dischargers subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards
shall submit to the Director any self monitoring reports required by 40 CFR
403.12 "b" and "g" and shall submit a satisfactory or approved schedule for
complying with the requirements of the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards.
   (b)   In addition to the above, the Director may require any discharger into
the sewerage system subject to the constraints of an IWPT program to submit
monthly or other periodic reports concerning the nature and characteristics of
their discharges and to develop and submit for approval a schedule for
complying with requirements of these Rules and Regulations and pretreatment
standards.
   (c)   Where additional pretreatment facilities or improved operation and
maintenance of existing facilities are indicated, the affected discharger shall
provide same with the submittal of a schedule for approval for achieving
compliance with the foregoing.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.27  IWPT PROGRAM COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS.
   The Director of the Wastewater Department, or his designee, shall have the
right as provided by Ohio R.C. 729.50, to enter upon the system user's property
at reasonable times during normal working hours, or at other times if there is
reason to believe that a noncomplying discharge is occurring, for the purpose
of inspecting, observing, measuring pretreatment facility operation, collecting
samples and/or testing the discharge from the property and to make independent
assessments of the dischargers compliance with these Rules and Regulations. 
Further, the Director, or his designee, shall be provided access to all reports
or records pertaining to the operation of any pretreatment facility and the
quality of the discharge from such facility.
   (a)   In the event that an industrial discharger does not comply with the
particulars of the IWPT program the Director shall certify same to the City
Manager who shall have the right to terminate water and sewer service to the
offending discharger until compliance is effected, to seek the imposition of
civil or monetary penalties for the redress of damages, to seek injunctive
relief through the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas or any other action
that may be deemed appropriate by the City Law Director, including all of the
above.
   (b)   Compliance information and data furnished to the Director with respect
to the general nature of a specific discharge shall be available to the public
or other government agencies without restrictions unless the discharger
requests and is able to demonstrate that the release of such information,
processes or methods of production would divulge information entitled to
protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of the discharger. 
Wastewater constituents or characteristics shall not be recognized as
confidential information according to Federal regulation 40 CFR, 403.14.
   (c)   When specifically requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the
portions of that report which may disclose trade secrets or protected
practices, shall not be made available to the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses relating to
these Rules and Regulations, to requirements of the NPDES permit or the IWPT
program and shall be available for use by any State agency in judicial review
or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing such report.
   (d)   Each industrial discharger, as well as the Director, shall keep and
maintain records of all information collected which relates to discharges into
the public sanitary sewer system in accordance with Federal regulation 40 CFR,
403.12 "N".  Such records shall be kept for a minimum of three years and shall
be kept longer if the information contained in such records is considered
pertinent to the resolution of any litigation, in progress or pending.  Such
records shall be made available for review or copying by the U.S. E.P.A., OEPA,
the City Manager, City Law Director or any of their authorized
representatives.  The Director shall not be required to inform any discharger
of the release of records for litigation.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.28  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   Industrial dischargers shall provide means of protecting against the
accidental discharge of substances prohibited by these Rules and Regulations
that by reason of excessive concentration, volume or characteristic may have an
adverse impact on the sewerage system or on human health, safety and general
welfare.  The facilities to prevent accidental discharges shall be constructed,
operated, maintained or replaced at the discharger's expense.  Detailed plans
showing the facilities and operating procedures established to provide this
protection shall be approved by the Director of the Wastewater Department and
the City Engineer before construction is initiated.  Review and approval of
accidental discharge prevention plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the discharger of responsibility should such plans or procedures fail
to prevent an accidental discharge.
   (a)   In the event of an accidental discharge or spill, it is the
responsibility of the discharger to notify the Director or Wastewater
Department personnel, if the Director is unavailable, by telephone as soon as
the event is discovered, that such an event has occurred.  This notification
shall contain information on the nature of the incident, location, type of
wastes, volume, concentrations and the corrective action being taken by the
discharger as well as corrective actions that the Department should undertake. 
Should such an event require the notification of the OEPA the discharger shall
make such notification following the notification of the Director.
   (b)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the offending
discharger shall submit a report to the Director detailing the cause of the
accidental discharge and the measures to be taken to prevent a similar future
occurrence.  The report shall not relieve the discharger of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of the discharge as
it may pertain to the City's system, fish kills in the receiving stream or
damage to persons or properties.  Nor shall the report relieve the discharger
from fines, civil penalties or other liabilities which may be imposed pursuant
to these Rules and Regulations, State and Federal laws.
   (c)   A notice shall be permanently and conspicuously posted on the
discharger's bulletin board or other prominent places advising the employees
whom to notify in the event of an accidental discharge.  Employers shall ensure
that all employees who may cause or permit such a discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedures.  Failure of an employee to
properly notify the Director or Department personnel concerning an accidental
discharge shall be considered the failure of the discharger to notify the
Director or Department personnel of the event.
   (d)   No discharger shall increase the use of potable water or process water
nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a
substitute for adequate pretreatment in order to achieve compliance with the
requirements set forth in these Rules and Regulations or applicable Categorical
Pretreatment Standards.  If dilution occurs for the purpose of controlling an
accidental discharge the Director or Department personnel shall be so informed.
   (e)   All decisions of the Director are subject to review by the City
Manager who may affirm, disaffirm or modify all such decisions.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.29  ESTABLISHMENT OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   Ohio R.C. 729.49 and 729.52, provides the legal authority of cities to
establish rates to be paid for sewer service.
   (a)   Council establishes the rates to be paid for sewer services via the
adoption of an ordinance specifying same.  Sewer rates shall conform at all
times to the applicable ordinance.
   (b)   Sewer rates reflect the true cost of providing sewer service which
includes operation and maintenance of the collection system, treatment plant,
personnel, administration and debt service, capital improvements and
replacements.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.30  MINIMUM CHARGE.
   There shall be a minimum charge to all system users to be paid at the rate
established by the applicable ordinance.
   (a)   Minimum charges reflect the fact that systems shall be maintained and
services provided regardless of the volume of wastewater discharged by any
system user.
   (b)   When houses are vacated or residents go on an extended vacation, the
system user shall be responsible for the minimum charge if the water to the
premises remains on and the property owner or his agent shall be responsible to
pay the minimum charge bill in accordance with established procedures.
   (c)   The resident may, in anticipation of an extended vacation of the
premises, request that the water service to the property be turned off in
accordance with Section
925.13 (a) and may thereby be relieved of the responsibility to pay the minimum
charge.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.31  IWPT PROGRAM SURCHARGES.
   Every person whose premises are served by a sewer service connection and
which discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids
other than normal strength sewage either directly or indirectly into the City's
system shall be charged and shall pay a sewer service surcharge in addition to
the conventional sewer service charge and in accordance with the applicable
ordinance by which the particulars of the surcharge are established.
   (a)   The cost of maintaining an IWPT program, as required by Federal
regulations, shall be recovered from the industrial users subject to the
requirements of the program.  For no reason or at any time shall the general
public be required to directly or indirectly defray the cost of an IWPT program
for any discharger in general or particular.
   (b)   The Finance Director shall establish and maintain a cost accounting
system for the identification of the costs associated with the implementation
of an IWTP program; such system shall include, but not be limited to the
following:
      (1)   Administration costs;
      (2)   User monitoring, sampling, testing and reporting costs; and
      (3)   Costs for special treatment of industrial waste pollutants that are
compatible pollutants but excessive in concentrations or in volume.
         (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.32  BILLING PERIODS.
   Utility service charges shall be based upon the total gallons of metered
water for the applicable period.
   (a)   Water meters shall be read during the odd numbered months (January,
March, May, July, September and November) by personnel bearing proper
identification. Meter reading shall begin on or before the fifteenth of the
specified months.
      (Ord. 2001-148.  Passed 11-7-01.)
   (b)   The City reserves the right to change the meter reading schedule in
relationship to frequency, geographical location of meter settings, split
population reading or alternate actual readings with estimated readings; any
one or combination of several strategies for the reading of meters may be
employed by the City.  Before any change of the standard procedure as described
in subsection (a) hereof, the residents shall be informed in writing by the
City of any projected change pertaining to meter reading.
   (c)   Bills shall be issued on or before the tenth of the even numbered
months (February, April, June, August, October and December) by the Utility
Department under the direct supervision of the Finance Director.
   (d)   Should there be a change in the meter reading strategy as described in
subsection (b) hereof, there shall of necessity be a corresponding change in
the billing procedures; nevertheless, no change in the billing procedures shall
be implemented until the residents are so informed in writing by the City.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.33  BILL PAYMENT.
   Utility bills shall be paid in full on or before the due date specified on
the bill and failure to receive a utility bill does not relieve the system user
of the responsibility to pay for utility service charge.
   (a)   Bills paid after the specified due date and prior to the disconnection
of water service shall be subject to a late charge fee to be established by the
Finance Director and published from time to time and/or so stated on the face
of the utility charge bill.
   (b)   A utility bill is considered paid when full payment is received at the
Utility Office located in the City Administration Building (City Hall) and the
City assumes no responsibility for late payment of a utility bill that may be
occasioned by delays in the mail delivered to the Utility Office by the U.S.
Postal Service.
   (c)   In addition to subsection (a) hereof, if payment has not been received
by two days before the scheduled shut off day, a shut off notice shall be
mailed to the affected party notifying them of the scheduled date for the
termination of water service.
   (d)   In all cases the property owner shall be ultimately responsible for
the payment of utility service charges regardless of any private agreements
with agents or tenants.  All late charge fees or other applicable fees that may
result from the failure to pay a utility bill, including reconnection of water
service fees, shall be paid in full by the property owner.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
   (e)   Any net bill not paid within eighteen days of the billing date shall
be charged at the gross figure which is five percent (5%) additional.
      (Ord. 92-1447.  Passed 8-4-92.)
925.34  DISCONNECTION AND RECONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   Should a utility bill remain unpaid and the attendant delinquent notice go
unheeded the water service to the property in question shall be disconnected.
   (a)   Sewer service shall be disconnected by the disconnection of the water
service which shall be by one of two methods:
      (1)   Wastewater Department personnel shall locate the curb box
containing the water on/off valve and shall place the valve in the off
position; or
      (2)   If the valve box cannot be located or should the valve prove to be
inoperable when located, Department personnel, bearing proper identification,
shall enter upon the property subject to the disconnection order and shut the
water off at the water meter and subsequently seal same.
   (b)   Reconnection of water/sewer service shall be accomplished by one of
two methods:
      (1)   When the total amount due has been paid, including all late charge
fees, a reconnection fee and miscellaneous fees, if applicable, by an
acceptable instrument at the Utility Office the water/sewer service shall be
reconnected by Department personnel; or
      (2)   When an acceptable arrangement has been reached between the
property owner and the City for full payment of the utility bill, including all
late charge fees, if applicable, the water/sewer service shall be reconnected
by Department personnel.
   (c)   In either case mentioned above, the actual time of the reconnection of
water/sewer service shall be subject to the availability of Department
personnel and every effort shall be made to expedite the procedure.
   (d)   Once the water/sewer service has been disconnected for failure to pay
a utility bill it shall be a violation of these Rules and Regulations as well
as law for any unauthorized person to reconnect the water/sewer service for any
reason.  Further, authorized personnel shall not reconnect water/sewer service
unless someone is present on the premises to certify that the water is indeed
on.
   (e)   The following list details some of the reasons water/sewer service may
be disconnected other than failure to pay a utility bill:
      (1)   Failure to repair a sewer service connection after notification by
the City to make such repair;
      (2)   Failure to repair a leak in a water service connection after
notification by the City to make such repair;
      (3)   Water meter tampering;
      (4)   Refusal to adequately protect the water meter from hazard, such as
freezing temperatures;
      (5)   Refusal to remove a cross connection or to provide for backflow
prevention;
      (6)   Unlawful dilution of an industrial waste subject to the particulars
of an IWPT program;
      (7)   Refusal to remedy unsanitary conditions on any premises served by a
water/sewer service connection;
      (8)   Violations of these Rules and Regulations in general.
   (f)   If a delinquent account remains unpaid the City reserves the right,
under law, to certify same to the Clermont County Auditor or the Hamilton
County Auditor, if applicable, by a certificate signed by the Finance
Director.  The County Auditor shall then place the amount certified by the
signed certificate on the appropriate tax duplicate with interest and penalties
allowed by law, including the applicable assessment fee.  The same shall be
collected as all other taxes and shall be considered as a lien upon the real
property served by the water/sewer service connection.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.35  ESTIMATED BILLS.
   When the meter reader is unable to obtain a reading from an inside meter
setting for any reason or if the existing remote recorder has malfunctioned the
Utility Secretary shall estimate usage based upon prior usages and issue a
utility bill based on that estimated usage.
   (a)   When a meter reading shall be estimated for two or more billing
periods the difference between the estimated usage and the actual usage as
certified by a meter reading may be significant; therefore, the property owner,
his agent or tenant is encouraged to provide access to the meter reader or to
request the installation of a remote recorder meter.  In any event, the
property owner shall be responsible to pay the utility bill regardless of the
impact exerted by the estimation of usage bill on subsequent utility bills.
   (b)   When a meter reader is unable to obtain a meter reading from an inside
meter setting after three consecutive meter reading periods or if the remote
recorder has malfunctioned and access cannot be gained for repair of the
recorder for a similar time period, the Director of the Wastewater Department
shall certify in writing to the affected property owner the necessity of
providing access to the meter for reading and/or repair.  If the property owner
ignores the notice requesting access to the water meter the Director may
authorize the disconnection of water/sewer service following a seven day period
after the issuance of the certified letter to the property owner.  Water/sewer
service shall not be reconnected until the Wastewater Department personnel have
been granted access to the water meter for reading and/or repair and until the
payment of a reconnection fee has been received by the Utility Office.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
   (c)   When meters fail to register properly an estimated bill for water and/
or wastewater services shall be issued based upon previous usage.
      (Ord. 92-1454.  Passed 8-4-92.)
925.36  DISPUTED BILLS.
   As a general policy all utility bills, disputed or not disputed, are to be
paid in full on or before the due date printed on the face of the utility bill.
   (a)   A property owner has the right to appeal a billing considered to be
inaccurate or in dispute by following the procedural guidelines listed below:
      (1)   The property owner shall notify the Utility Office within ten days
of the billing date, in writing, of the precise nature of the dispute.
      (2)   The Utility Secretary shall review the account and in consultation
with the Director of the Wastewater Department determine a resolution of the
disputed billing; a written notice of the review and resolution shall be sent
to the affected property owner.
      (3)   The property owner may appeal the review and resolution of the
Utility Office to the City Manager; the City Manager or his designee shall
review the disputed billing and make a final determination.
      (4)   Once a final determination has been rendered by the City Manager or
his designee a written notice stating same shall be issued to the affected
property owner and the bill shall no longer be considered in dispute and the
particulars of the final determination shall be in force.
      (5)   When a disputed bill is being appealed by the property owner the
water/sewer service shall not be disconnected; should the utility bill remain
unpaid after the imposition of a final determination the water/sewer service
shall be disconnected for nonpayment.
      (6)   During the appeal process the City reserves the right to waive or
to impose a late charge fee and shall determine same on a case by case basis.
   (b)   Only two appeals of utility service charges shall be permitted during
any calendar year and the Wastewater Department reserves the right to impose
charges or fees for a second appeal should the second appeal prove to be the
second "unjustified" appeal for the year.  The charges or fees that may be
imposed shall cover the administration costs associated with the second appeal.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.37  RETURNED CHECKS.
   As a general policy, the Finance Director shall establish a fee amount to be
paid by the affected party for a check returned to the Utility Office by the
bank for insufficient funds or for other reasons which prevent the honoring of
the check.
   (a)   The actual amount for the returned check fee shall be posted
conspicuously at the pay window of the Utility Office; the amount may be
obtained by calling the Utility Office Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.
   (b)   Failure to pay in full the utility bill, returned check fee and any
applicable late charges shall result in the disconnection of water/sewer
service and the commencement of appropriate legal action for the issuance of a
bad check.
   (c)   The City reserves the right to waive legal action for a returned check
based upon a mediation of circumstances; however, the affected party shall pay
in full the utility bill, returned check fee, applicable late charges and a
reconnection fee if the water/sewer service was disconnected for nonpayment.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.38  FINAL BILLING.
   When a property owner or his agent issues a request to the Utility Secretary
for the disconnection of water/sewer service the Utility Secretary shall issue
a work order specifying same; Wastewater Department personnel shall read the
water meter and disconnect the water/sewer service by placing the curb box
valve in the off position.  The property owner or his agent shall be present on
the premises when the water is disconnected to certify that the water is indeed
off.
   (a)   Water/sewer service may be disconnected upon the request of the
property owner or his agent and all such requests shall be directed to the
Utility Secretary at the Utility Office during normal working hours.
   (b)   The property owner shall be responsible for payment of the final
utility bill which shall be issued during the regularly scheduled billing
period.  The property owner remains responsible to the Utility Office to supply
forwarding addresses or to indicate any changes that might affect the billing
procedures.
   (c)   A request for new utility service shall not be honored by the City if
the property owner or tenant requesting such service is delinquent in the
payment of a utility bill, final or otherwise, or is indebted to the Department
in any manner.
   (d)   A disconnection of water/sewer service fee shall be charged to the
customer or property owner requesting a final billing if the person requesting
the disconnection of service or their agent fails to appear requiring a return
visit by City personnel.
      (Ord. 90-1343.  Passed 11-6-90.)
925.39  MISCELLANEOUS CHARGES AND FEES.
   Miscellaneous charges and fees for various services performed by the
Wastewater Department shall be established by the Finance Director and
published from time to time at his discretion.
   (a)   The aforementioned charges and fees may be levied for, but not
necessarily limited to, the following reasons:
      (1)   Emergency repair of a sewer service connection requested by the
property owner or required by the Director of the Wastewater Department for

based upon a mediation of circumstances; however, the affected party shall pay

1303.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1303.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.

Commission shall receive from such property owner his written consent for his
property to be designated as a landmark and to be included under the terms and
conditions of this chapter.
   (b)   Once the written consent has been given by such property owner and
such property has been designated as a landmark, then such property is included
under the terms and conditions of this chapter, and such designation shall be
permanent.
(Ord. 489.  Passed 9-3-74.)
1317.05  CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION OF LANDMARKS.
   (a)   In considering the designation of any building, structure, work of art
or similar object in the City as landmarks, the Historical and Architectural
Protection and Preservation Commission shall apply the following criteria with
respect to such property:
      (1)   Its character, interest or value as part of the development,
heritage or cultural characteristics of the City, State of Ohio or the United
States;
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant historic event;
      (3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the culture and development of the City;
      (4)   Its exemplification of the cultural, economic, social, political or
historic heritage of the City;
      (5)   Its embodiment of distinguishing characteristics of an
architectural type of specimen;
      (6)   Its identification as the work of an architect or master builder
whose individual work has influenced the development of the City;
      (7)   Its embodiment of elements of architectural design, detail,
materials or craftsmanship which represent a significant architectural
innovation; and
      (8)   Its unique location or singular physical characteristic
representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood
community of the City.
   (b)   The Commission may accept or reject requests of property owners to be
declared "landmarks"; it can propose to property owners that it would be
valuable to the City should a building, structure, work of art or object be
declared landmarks and it shall follow the prescribed procedure:
      (1)   The Commission shall notify the owner of the property of the
proposed designation and receive from him written consent for such designation.
      (2)   The Historical and Architectural Protection and Preservation
Commission shall advise the Planning Commission of the proposed designation and
secure from the Planning Commission its recommendation of the proposed
designation in relation to the Zoning Code and its opinion of the effect on the
surrounding neighborhood.  The Planning Commission may approve, reject or
modify the request of the Historical and Architectural Protection and
Preservation Commission.  That recommendation shall become part of the official
record concerning the proposed designation and shall be submitted by the
Planning Commission along with its
         recommendation to Council. The Historical and Architectural Protection
and Preservation Commission may make such modifications, changes and
alterations concerning the proposed designation as it deems necessary in
consideration of the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Council shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the Historical and Architectural Protection and Preservation
Commission and the recommendations of the Planning Commission in making its
determination with respect to the proposed designation of any building,
structure, work of art or other similar object as landmarks.  Council may, in
its discretion, hold public hearings on any such proposed designation.  Upon
conclusion of its study and if Council approved the designation it shall
designate by ordinance such building, structure, work of art or object as
landmarks.
         (Ord. 489.  Passed 9-3-74.)

style, general design, texture and other visible external aspects of the other
structures in immediate vicinity, in order to achieve a harmonious blend within
the neighborhood.  And in conducting its inquiry and review, the Commission may
request from the applicant such additional information, sketches and data as it
shall reasonably require.  It may recommend to the applicant changes in the
plans that it considers desirable, and can accept his voluntary amendment of
the application to include or reflect such changes.  The Commission Secretary
shall keep a record of its proceedings and shall append to the application
copies of information, sketches and data needed to clearly describe any
amendment to it, such to be furnished by the applicant.
   (b)   When its review is concluded, the Commission shall determine, by vote
of its members, whether the application for a permit as presented or as
amended, shall be approved.  If approved, the Commission shall return the
application and appended material to the Building Inspector with the
recommendation that the permit be issued, provided all other requirements are
met.  If not approved, the Commission shall return the application and appended
material to the Building Inspector with the instruction that the permit not be
issued because the intent and purposes of this chapter were not satisfied. 
When so instructed, the Building Inspector shall not issue the permit, and the
applicant shall be notified of the decision and reasons for it.
(Ord. 489.  Passed 9-3-74.)

1319.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of Milford, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
(Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.  (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-
6-04.)
1319.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.  (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
      (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1319.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.  (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City of Milford, Ohio Clermont and
Hamilton Counties dated November l6, l994.
Flood Insurance Study for the City of Milford, Ohio Clermont and Hamilton
Counties dated November l6, 1994.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard include:
Flood Insurance Rate Map for Clermont County, Ohio (Unincorporated Areas) dated
March 16, 2006.
Flood Insurance Study for Clermont County, Ohio (Unincorporated Areas) dated
March 16, 2006.

   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by Section
1319.27  Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Milford City Building: 745 Center Street, Suite 200,
Milford, Ohio.  (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04; Ord. 06-504.  Passed 2-21-06;
Ord. 09-767.  Passed 12-1-09.)
1319.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
(resolutions) including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In
the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance
(resolution), the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall
not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to
such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.11  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a  structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor”  See "Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).”  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood or flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)”.  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones”.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation.”  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 1 (one) foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway”.
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).”  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMP)  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park”.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection

the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1319.34 , Appeals and variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.  (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.23  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.

      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1319.33(a)(2)A. and C. to E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the  USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites. An  Illustrated Guide to Field Technique
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1319.21 (a)( l )C., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

(Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.38  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the Building
Inspector, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold
a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Building Inspector. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board  may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes  of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1319.38 (c)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.  (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)
1319.39  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (d)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (e)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (f)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.

attendance of witnesses.  A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance
and service shall be collected in advance.
   (h)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.

decision to the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter
2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 04-383.  Passed 7-6-04.)

1131.10 USE VARIANCES PROHIBITED
For the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, a use variance is not authorized and

the establishment or expansion of a use of land that is not permitted in the zoning
district in which the property is located.
1131.11 AREA VARIANCES
A. Upon receipt of a complete application, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
authorize an area variance from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to
the public interest according to the following procedures and the variance
standards set forth in this Chapter. Substantial justice requires that the interests
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1131 -
4
of the community, neighborhood and adjoining property owners be given due
consideration in each variance case.
B. Area variances shall be defined as those variances from a zoning regulation that
establishes minimum or maximum areas, heights, distances, separation volume
or any other United States customary unit of measurement.
C. Application Requirements. An application for an area variance shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator upon the forms provided by the City, and shall
be accompanied by the following requirements necessary to convey the
reason(s) for the requested variance:
1. Name, address and phone number of applicant(s);

D. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing as set forth in 1131.06.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review each application for an area variance
to determine if it complies with the purpose and intent of this Code and
evidence demonstrates that the literal enforcement of this Code will result in a
practical difficulty. A practical difficulty exists whenever a zoning standard
unreasonably deprives a landowner of a permitted use of their property. All of
the factors set forth in this section do not need to be satisfied; rather, they shall
be weighed together in the analysis. The factors to be considered and weighed in
determining whether a property owner seeking an area variance has encountered
practical difficulties in the use of his property include, but are not limited to:
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1131 -
5
1. Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land or structure involved and which are not applicable generally to
other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of such
special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
2. Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
3. Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to make
possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
4. Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
5. Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental
services such as water, sewer, and trash pickup;
6. Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of the
zoning restrictions;
7. Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of actions of
the owner;
8. Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
9. Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be
observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
10. Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
E. Requests for Additional Information. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board deems
necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
F. Variance Conditions. In authorizing a variance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character
and other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem
necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance and/or the Water Management and Sediment Control Regulations,
and in the public interest. In authorizing a variance with attached conditions,
the Board may require such evidence and guarantee of bond, as it may deem
necessary, that the conditions attached are and shall be complied with.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1131 -
6
Specifically, the Board may attach one or more of the following conditions to a
variance:

of such conditions shall be enforced in the following manner:
1. Upon a finding that one or more variance conditions have not been
satisfied, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant of the
violation in writing by certified mail.
2. The applicant shall have thirty days from the receipt of the notice of
violation to satisfy the variance condition.
3. Failure to satisfy the condition(s) within the thirty day period shall result in
the revocation of the variance approval.
H. Time Limit. Approved variances that are not acted upon within 12 months shall
be considered void.
1131.12 ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS
A. The administrative adjustment procedures of this section are intended to provide
a streamlined approval procedure for minor modifications of selected zoning
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1131 -
7
standards. Administrative adjustments are intended to:
1. Allow development that is more in keeping with the established character of
the neighborhood, as opposed to development that is in strict compliance
with zoning standards;
2. Provide flexibility that will help promote rehabilitation and reuse of existing
buildings when such flexibility will not adversely affect nearby properties or
neighborhood character; and
3. Provide limited flexibility for new construction when necessary to address
unusual site and development conditions when such flexibility will not
adversely affect nearby properties or neighborhood character.
B. Administrative adjustments may only be requested for the following
zoning standards:
1. Reducing the minimum front, side, and rear yard setbacks as required by
standards of the zoning district by the greater of ten (10) percent of the
requirement or one (1) foot;
2. Increasing the maximum height permitted by the zoning standards of the
zoning district for principal and accessory structures by the greater of ten
(10) percent of the requirement or one (1) foot;
3. Increasing the maximum height of freestanding signs permitted by the
standards of the zoning district by the greater of ten (10) percent of the
requirement or one (1) foot;
4. Reducing the minimum setback of freestanding signs permitted by the
standards of the zoning district by the greater of ten (10) percent of the
requirement or one (1) foot.
C. Administrative Adjustment Procedure:
1. The procedures and requirements set forth in Section 1131.11(C) shall be
utilized for administrative adjustment applications.
2. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to review and approve or deny an
application for an administrative adjustment in accordance with this section.
3. The Zoning Administrator may remit any application for an administrative
adjustment to the Board of Zoning Appeals for review by the Board. In this
instance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall maintain the authority to decide
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1131 -
8
the remitted application. The public hearing procedure as set forth in
Section 1131.06 will be required for administrative adjustment applications
before the Board of Zoning Appeals.
4. An aggrieved applicant may appeal the Zoning Administrator’s final
decision on an administrative adjustment application in accordance with
Section 1131.09.
D. Administrative Adjustment Standards of Review. Administrative
adjustments shall be approved upon a finding the applicant demonstrates the
following standards are met:
1. General. The requested administrative adjustment is not inconsistent with
the character of the development in the surrounding area, and will not result
in incompatible uses.
2. Mitigates Adverse Impacts. Any adverse impacts resulting from the
administrative adjustment will be mitigated to the maximum extent
practicable.
3. Technical Nature. The administrative adjustment seeks relief from an area
(dimensional) standard and is either:
a. Required to compensate for some unusual aspect of the site that is
not shared by landowners in general;
b. Supporting an objective or goal from the purpose and intent
statements of the zoning district where located.
4. Not Substantially Interfere with Convenient and Enjoyable Use of Adjacent
Land. The administrative adjustment will not substantially interfere with the
convenient and enjoyable use of adjacent parcels, and will not pose a danger
to the public health or safety.
E. Conditions of Approval. In approving an administrative adjustment, the Zoning
Administrator may grant a lesser modification than requested by an applicant,
and may impose appropriate conditions on the permit approval in accordance
with Section 1131.11(F).
F. Effect. The issuance of an administrative adjustment shall authorize only the
particular administrative adjustment that is approved in the permit. An
administrative adjustment, shall run with the land and not be affected by a
subsequent change in property ownership.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1131 -

certificate to the applicant or appellant, whenever a certificate is authorized by
the Board.

1169.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REVIEW PROCESS
A Planned Development District overlays an existing zoning district or districts. The
establishment of a Planned Development, pursuant to this Chapter, is a three step
process. First, the Planned Development District is established by City Council as a
zoning map amendment pursuant to Chapter 1133, Changes and Amendments. The
approval or denial of the establishment of a Planned Development District is a
legislative action by the City Council, with a recommendation by the Planning
Commission. Second, a Preliminary Development Plan must be reviewed and acted
on by City Council with a recommendation by the Planning Commission pursuant to
Section 1169.06 of this Chapter. Action on the Preliminary Plan by City Council is an
administrative act. Third, a Final Development Plan must be reviewed and acted on
by Planning Commission pursuant to Section 1169.07 of this Chapter. The Planning
Commission’s action on a Final Development Plan is final.

1169.03 RESIDENTIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
A. Permitted Uses
The permitted uses in a “PD” Planned Development District shall be those uses
permitted in the district in which the “PD” District is to be located; in addition,
the following uses shall be permitted in a residential “PD” District:
1. Cluster Housing in areas designated as such on the Milford Land Use Plan in
compliance with the following standards:
a. The overall density shall not exceed that permitted in the underlying
zoning.
b. When single family dwellings are to be clustered into townhomes or
condominiums, there shall be no more than four units per structure.
c. When lots area requirements are decreased to allow for the clustering of
single-family lots, the minimum lot area shall be 8,000 square feet for each
dwelling unit. The remaining undeveloped property may be used to satisfy
the open space requirements provided in Section 1169.03 (L).
d. Lot or dwelling clustering shall be done in such a way as to protect
sensitive areas.
e. Sensitive areas shall be identified on both the preliminary and final
development plan and shall be treated as common open space that may not
be developed in the future.

i. Street trees shall be planted on both sides of the street. Such trees shall
meet the minimum quality standards set forth in Chapter 1189,
Landscaping and Bufferyard Requirements.
3. A “B-1” commercial use provided that the residential “PD” District is twenty
acres or more in size. One area may be designated as a neighborhood shopping
area, not to exceed two (2) acres in size, except that an additional one-half
acre of “B-1” commercial uses may be permitted for each additional fifteen
acres of “PD” District area, but not to exceed six acres.
Where commercial uses are planned in conjunction with residential uses, the
commercial uses cannot be constructed until at least sixty percent (60%) of the
total dwellings are complete or under construction, unless authorized by the
Planning Commission.
B. Project Area
It is the intent of this chapter that the use of the Planned Development District will
yield the same net density of dwelling units as would development under
conventional zoning. Therefore, the project area that will be used to determine the
permitted number of units shall be limited to all of the area within the Planned
Development that is devoted to residential use, including open space and
recreational uses designed to serve the residential development, specifically
excluding but not limited land located within a floodway and land allocated for
public right-of-way.
C. Density Calculation
The Planning Commission shall determine the net number of dwelling units which
may constructed within the residential “PD” District by dividing the project area
by either of the following:
1. The required lot area per dwelling unit which is required in the district on
which the “PD” District is located; or
2. The required lot area per dwelling unit which is required in the district on
which the “PD” District is located, as modified by any increases in density
permitted under Subsection (H) below.
D. Planned Development in Multiple Zoning Districts
If a residential “PD” District covers more than one (1) zoning district, the number
of allowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of the
“PD” District located in a separate zoning district, and then must be combined to
determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire “PD” District.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1169 -
4
However, the distribution of the dwelling units within the “PD” District is not to
be affected by existing zoning district boundaries.
E. Submittal Requirements

Figure 1187-C
C. Maneuverability Areas.
In order to promote adequate maneuverability, the following provisions shall be
followed:
1. Turn-Around Area.
With the exemption of driveways serving single family dwellings, wherever
more than three (3) parking spaces are served by a single driveway, a turnaround
area shall be provided, or other provision shall be made, to permit cars
to exit the parking lot or garage without backing onto any street or sidewalk.
2. Back-Up Area.
Each parking space shall be provided with a sufficient back-up area to permit
egress in one maneuver, consisting of one backward and one forward
movement.
D. Handicapped Parking Spaces.
The number and dimension of parking spaces serving handicapped persons shall
conform to the requirements of the Ohio Basic Building Code.
E. Surface and Drainage.
Every off-street parking lot shall be surfaced with an ODOT Item 448 asphalt
concrete or Portland cement pavement providing an all-weather, durable, and
dustless surface. Individual stalls shall be graded to drain so as to dispose of all
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1187 - 6
surface water within the parking area. No surface water from parking areas shall
accumulate or drain over a public sidewalk or street. Interior landscaped areas
may be used for surface drainage.
F. Lighting.
Fixed lighting shall comply with the provisions contained in Section 1187.08,
Outdoor Lighting, and be so arranged to prevent direct glare of beams onto any
public or private property or street.
G. Wheel Stops and Continuous Curbs.
Wheel stops or continuous curbs shall be provided, located, and designed to
protect required screening devices and landscaping and pedestrian ways from
damage or encroachment of vehicles and to provide necessary traffic control in the
parking area.
1. Wheel Stops.
Each wheel stop shall be a singular block of reinforced concrete, stone, or
other durable material six inches (6") in height, six inches (6") in width, and
eight feet (8') in length. Wheel stops shall be securely attached to the ground
and may be used only at the end of parking stalls.
2. Continuous Curbs.
Continuous curbs shall be made of asphalt, concrete, or stone, and shall be a
minimum of six inches (6") in height and six inches (6") in width. They shall
form a non-interrupted edge around all landscaped areas adjacent to parking
and turn-around areas which are not protected by wheel stops.
3. Placement.
The wheel stop or continuous curb shall be located a minimum of four feet (4')
from any structures, buildings, walls, or plant material, excluding
groundcover, to prevent a vehicle from driving onto the landscape area or
hitting any structure or plant material at the edge of the parking area. The
mature size of the plant material shall be specified to determine if the
landscape meets the setback requirements.
4. Stall Dimensions.
Where continuous curbs are used, the paved area of the parking stall length
required in Table 1187-A and illustrated in Figure 1187-B (Dimension 'C')
may be reduced by two and one-half feet (2½') as shown in Figure 1187-D
provided that the vehicle overhang will not encroach on pedestrian circulation
or the required setback for desirable plant growth. Where wheel stops are
used, the paved area of the parking stall length required in Table 1187-A and
illustrated in Figure 1187-B (Dimension 'C') shall not be reduced.

maneuvering area for parking spaces, or loading area shall be located within any
required front yard. This restriction shall not apply to driveways providing access
from the street to the parking area located outside of the required front yard, nor is
it intended to prohibit parking of vehicles on such drive serving a detached
dwelling. Within ten feet (10') of the right-of-way, the maximum width of the
driveway shall be twenty-four feet (24') in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Zoning Districts.

outdoors in all districts.
2. The location and duration of temporary parking or storage of an unlicensed
operable vehicle may be approved by the Zoning Inspector through the
issuance of a Temporary Zoning Permit on the basis of the adequacy of the
parcel size, condition of the vehicle, visibility from other properties and
absence of undue adverse impact on adjacent property or on the area as a
whole.
D. Traffic Patterns.
All parking garages and lots shall be located and designed to encourage minimal
routing of traffic along public rights-of-way contiguous to blocks that contain
primary education facilities or recreation sites designed for children or which have
over fifty percent (50%) of their frontage developed with single- or two-family
dwellings.
1187.09 LANDSCAPING FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING AREAS
A. Applicability.
1. Scope.
The application of the landscape regulations established by this Section shall
be limited to the same scope as defined in Section 1187.02 of this Chapter.
2. Exception.
Off-street parking and loading areas containing less than five (5) parking
spaces shall be exempt from the requirements of Section 1187.09.
Where the total parking provided is located in more than one location on a site
and each location contains less than five (5) parking spaces, each such area
shall be exempt from Section 1187.09 if separated on all sides by at least
twenty feet (20') of non-paved area.
3. Alteration or expansion.
Where an existing vehicular use area containing less than five (5) contiguous
parking spaces is expanded and thereby contains five (5) or more contiguous
parking spaces, landscaping for the entire area shall be provided and not
merely to the extent of its expansion.
B. Total Landscaping Required.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1187 - 9
The total landscaping required in off-street parking and loading areas is 22 sq. ft.
per parking space. Interior and streetscape landscaping count toward the minimum
square feet of landscaping required per parking space.
C. Interior Landscaping Standards.
Interior landscaping shall comply with the following standards:
1. Design
Landscape areas shall be peninsular or island types.
2. Location
All parking spaces must be at least within 125 feet of a landscaped area.
3. Minimum Area
The minimum landscape area shall be one hundred (100) square feet.
4. Surface
Any landscape area provided under this Section shall not contain bare soil.
Any ground area shall be covered with stones, mulch, vegetative ground
cover, or other surfaces permeable by water.
5. Retention/Detention Basins
Natural or landscaped retention/detention basins may count toward minimum
square footage landscape requirements when the basins are in the front or side
yards.
6. Traffic Visibility
No landscaping shall obscure visibility at a vehicular intersection with the
parking area or other areas where clear visibility is necessary to assure safe
circulation. Where safe visibility is impaired, canopy trees shall have branches
removed from the trunk at least five (5) feet above the ground and shrubs or
groundcover shall not exceed two (2) feet in height. Evergreen trees and
understory trees that would impair visibility for safe circulation shall not be
planted in these areas.
7. Minimum Width
No interior landscaping area shall be less than ten (10) feet by ten (10) feet.
D. Determination of Interior Landscape Requirements.
The Landscape Requirements shall be computed as follows:
1. Interior Landscape Area Requirement.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1187 - 10
Determine the landscape area by multiplying the Landscape Area Requirement
of 22 sq. ft. per parking space (Section 1187.09 (B)) by the total number of
parking spaces on the lot.
2. Planting Requirements.
To determine the minimum number of canopy trees, use the rate of one (1)
canopy tree for each 10 parking spaces for retail uses and two (2) canopy trees
for each 10 parking spaces for non-retail uses. Any fractional number of trees
shall be calculated to the next highest whole number.
To determine the total number of required shrubs, use the rate of six (6) shrubs for
each 10 parking spaces for retail uses and three (3) shrubs for each 10 parking
spaces for non-retail uses. One canopy tree may substitute for 3 shrubs. Trees and
shrubs do not have to be equally spaced, but may be grouped.
E. Overlap.
When any portion of the parcel is subject to more than one set of landscape or
buffer requirements as set forth in this or any other Chapter, the most stringent
requirement shall control. The most stringent requirements shall be defined as
those which require the highest fence, wall or screen or, if no fence, wall or screen
is required, the requirements with the greatest quantity of landscaping.
F. Credit.
Existing trees and shrubs, fences, walls or berms on a parcel may be used to meet
the requirements of this Section if they meet the standards established in this
Chapter.
G. Plant Installation and Maintenance Standards.
All new plant material as part of the requirements for this Chapter shall be in
accordance with Chapter 1189, Landscaping and Bufferyard Requirements.
H. Modifications.
In the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a development site, the
size of the parcel to be developed, the extent of expansion or redevelopment of the
site or parking area is deemed to be insignificant, or the presence of existing
buffers on adjacent developed property would make strict adherence to the
requirements of this Chapter serve no meaningful purpose or would make it
physically impossible to install and maintain the required landscaping, the
Planning Commission may, upon proper application by the property owner, and
upon making findings of fact, modify the requirements of this Chapter provided
the existing or resulting landscape features of the development site comply with
the spirit and intent of this Chapter and other related Chapters.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1187 - 11

SECTION 1191.03 COMPUTATIONS AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1191-8
A. Computation of Sign Area.
1. Freestanding Sign: The area of a freestanding sign shall be determined by computing
the visible surface display are, that is, all solid surface area excluding air space and
architectural features.
Figure 1191-1. Freestanding Signs. Source: Hamilton County Zoning Resolution
2. Building Sign: The area of a building sign shall be determined by computing the
visible surface display area, that is the words, numbers, and/or graphics which are
totally enclosed by a frame or graphic design. In the case of words containing lower
case letters mounted individually to the wall of the building, the area of the sign is the
square footage area that is measured by taking the height of the lower case letters
multiplied by the total word length. See Figure 1191-2.

Milford Zoning Ordinance 1191-9
B. Computation of a Multifaced Sign Area.
1. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together
the area of all sign faces visible from any one point.
2. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the
same sign structure and are not more than twenty-four inches apart, the sign area shall
be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
Figure 1191-3. Multifaced Sign. Source: Hamilton County Zoning Resolution
C. Computation of Height.
1. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at
normal grade to the top of the highest attached Component of the sign.
2. Where a freestanding sign or sign structure is mounted along a roadway that has a
higher grade level as compared to
the grade level directly below the
freestanding sign or sign structure,
then the freestanding sign or
structures height will be measured
from the roadway grade to the
highest point of the freestanding
sign or structure. See Figure 1191-
4.

Milford Zoning Ordinance 1197-1
CHAPTER 1197NON-CONFORMING USES
1197.01 PURPOSE
Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance, or by amendments thereto
which may later be adopted, lots, uses of land, structures and uses of structures and
land in combination exist which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance. The legitimate interest of those who lawfully
established these non-conformities are herein recognized by providing for their
continuance, subject to regulations limiting their completion, restoration,
reconstruction, extension and substitution. Furthermore, nothing contained in this
Zoning Ordinance shall be construed to require any change in the layout, plans,
construction, size or use of any lot, structure, or structure and land in combination, for
which a zoning permit became effective prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance. or any amendment thereto. Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this
Zoning Ordinance that such non-conformities be allowed to continue until removed,
they should not be encouraged to survive. Therefore, no nonconformity may be
moved, extended, altered, expanded or used as grounds for any other use(s) or
structure(s) prohibited elsewhere in the district without the approval of the Board of
Zoning Appeals, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Zoning
Ordinance.
1197.02 CERTIFICATES FOR NONCONFORMING USES
The Zoning Inspector may upon his own initiative, or shall upon the request of any
owner, issue a certificate for any lot, structure, use of land, use of structure, or use of
land and structure in combination, that certifies that the lot, structure or use is a valid
non-conforming use. The certificate shall specify the reason why the use is a nonconforming
use, including a description of the extent and kind of use made of the
property in question, the portion of the structure or land used for the non-conforming
use, and the extent that dimensional requirements are non-conforming, The purpose
of this section is to protect the owners of lands or structures that are or became nonconforming.
No fee shall be charged for such a certificate. One copy of the certificate
shall be returned to the owner and one copy shall be retained by the Zoning Inspector,
who shall maintain as a public record a file of all such certificates.
1197.03 SUBSTITUTION OF NONCONFORMING USES
So long as no structural alterations are made, except as required by enforcement of
other codes or ordinances, any non-conforming use may, upon appeal to and approval
by the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed to another non-conforming use if the
Board finds that the use proposed for substitution is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such
change, the Board may require that additional conditions and safeguards be met,
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1197-2
which requirements shall pertain as stipulated conditions to the approval of such
change, and failure to meet such conditions shall be considered a punishable violation
of this Zoning Ordinance. Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a less
intensive use or becomes a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed
to a more intensive use.
1197.04 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION
If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous
frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this
Zoning Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered
to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, and no portion of
such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot
width and area requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any
division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the
requirements stated in this Zoning Ordinance.
1197.05 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
A. Where, at the time of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, lawful uses of land exist
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning
Ordinance, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful,
provided:
1. No such non-conforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
2. No such non-conforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
3. If any such non-conforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned
for more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which
such land is located.
4. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such non-conforming use of
land.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1197-3
1197.06 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this Zoning Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, bulk or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
1. No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity; and
2. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located
after it is moved.
1197.07 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND
LAND IN COMBINATION
A. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in
changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which
it is located;
2. Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
3. If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a structure
or structure and land in combination, may, upon appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals, be changed to another non-conforming use provided that
the Board shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing non-conforming use. In
permitting such change, the Board may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with other provisions of this Zoning Ordinance;
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1197-4
4. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming
use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
5. When a non-conforming use of a structure. or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than two years
(except when government action impedes access to the premises), the
structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located; and
6. Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
non-conforming status of the land except as provided for in Section
1197.09(a).
1197.08 TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES
A. Termination of Use Through Discontinuance. When any non-conforming use is
discontinued or abandoned for more than one year, any new use shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
The intent to continue a non-conforming use shall not be evidence of its
continuance.
B. Termination of Use by Damage or Destruction. Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance
shall prevent the restoration of a non-conforming use, building or structure
destroyed or damaged or prevent the continuance of such non-conforming use,
provided that the owners of the property in question shall file with the Zoning
Inspector a notice of intention to continue the non-conforming use within six
months of such destruction or damage, and provided further that such restoration
or construction is commenced within one year of the date of such notice of
intention to continue the non-conforming use in question. In the event that such
notice is not filed, then the non-conforming use in question shall be deemed to
have been abandoned.
1. A zoning certificate pertaining to such restoration shall be applied for and
issued within one year of such destruction, and rebuilding shall be diligently
pursued to completion.
2. Such restoration shall not cause a new nonconformity, nor shall it increase the
degree of nonconformance or noncompliance existing prior to such damage or
destruction.
Milford Zoning Ordinance 1197-5
1197.09 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming
use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that the cubic content
existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this
section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of
any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with
protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. Where appropriate, a
building permit for such activities shall be required.
