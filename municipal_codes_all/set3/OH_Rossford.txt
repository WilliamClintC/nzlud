recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane

hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Municipal Code shall not be construed to affect
a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision prior
to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for the
enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be construed
to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in violation of any
such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or prosecution

full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision and

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

the “Municipality”,  shall continue to be a body politic and corporate under
the name of Rossford, with the same boundaries as now exist, but with power and
authority to change the boundaries and annex other territory contiguous thereto
in the manner authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio. No territory shall
be detached therefrom, nor shall the Municipality be annexed to any other

Municipality be terminated, without the consent of its Council and of a
majority of the electors of the Municipality voting on such proposal at an
election held and conducted in the manner provided by law.
Article II
MUNICIPAL POWERS

hereafter granted to municipalities by the Constitution of the State of Ohio

the State of Ohio. All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed
in this Charter or, if not prescribed herein, in such lawful manner as the
Council shall determine by ordinance or resolution. Enumeration of or reference

any proposed amendment or amendments to the electors to the extent that such
submission is not governed by this Charter or the Constitution of the State of
Ohio.

of the electors voting thereon, it or they shall become a part of this Charter;

   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Municipal Code applies to all re-
enactments or amendments thereof.

   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1. 49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Municipal Code or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Municipal Code or in any ordinance of the Municipality, any
act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever-the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise
provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

five members vote to dispense with the second and third readings or third
reading then one or two readings, as the case might be, shall suffice. After an
ordinance or resolution has been read for the third time or the first or second
time if members have voted to dispense with the second and third or third
readings, as the case might be, it shall be voted upon.
   (c)    When an ordinance or resolution is read, it shall be read fully and

ordinance or resolution shall be read fully and distinctly at least once before
it is voted on.
(Ord.  1078. Passed 1-24-77.)
111.10  EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES, RESOLUTIONS AND EMERGENCY MEASURES;
ADOPTION OF EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   (a)    A motion to declare an ordinance or resolution an emergency measure
pertains to the effective date of the ordinance or resolution after passage,
rather than to the number of times it must be read before passage.

covered in the second sentence of this paragraph, is thirty days after:
      (1)    Approval by the Mayor;

by the Mayor or expiration of the time for disapproval or passage after
disapproval.
   (c)    A motion to declare an ordinance or resolution an emergency measure
should state the reason for the emergency. It should indicate adoption is
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety;
indicate a public rather than private emergency; and preferably indicate the
specific nature of the emergency.
   (d)    When an ordinance or resolution is adopted as an emergency measure,

legislation prior to adoption.
(Ord. 1078. Passed 1-24-77.)

111.13  COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.

to discuss matters referred to the standing and special committees in addition
to matters referred to the Committee of the Whole.

111.14  COMMITTEES GENERALLY.
   (a)    Ordinances, resolutions, petitions, correspondence and other matters
before Council may be referred to appropriate committees of Council for
investigation, study and report. When it is felt that every member should
express himself on a particular matter, rather than restrict consideration to a
smaller committee, the matter may be referred to the Committee of the Whole.
   (b)    Questions as to whether matters should be referred to a committee,
and which committees they should be referred to, shall be resolved by vote of
the majority of those present. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall
take precedence over a motion to refer to a special committee.
   (c)    The Council Rules shall govern the Committee of the Whole and
standing and special committees. However, no limit shall be placed on the time
or frequency of speaking and the previous question cannot be moved. All
questions shall be decided by majority vote in standing and special committees;
by at least two votes in three member committees; and by majority vote of those
present in the Committee of the Whole.
   (d)    When matters are referred to committees, they shall report back at
the next regular Council meeting. Reports may include several subjects and
shall be in writing. Members may approve only some items in a report, request
separate votes on separate items and file minority reports. Documents referred
to committees shall be returned with the reports.
   (e)    Council, by majority of those elected, may relieve any committee of
further consideration of any matter and order that the matter be placed on the
agenda.
   (f)    When a committee report recommends adoption of ordinances or
resolutions, or actions that should be by ordinance or resolution, such
ordinances and resolutions shall always be separately prepared, introduced,
read and voted upon. Unanimous approval of a committee report shall have no
effect on this requirement.
   (g)    Meetings of all committees shall be considered public hearings on all
matters referred to the committees for consideration. All comments to be made
by members of the public shall be made at these committee meetings and shall be
restricted thereto. All testimony, pro and con, shall be presented in the
committee hearings.
   (h)    The committees to which legislation is referred shall not concern
themselves with the fulfillment of legal requirements. They will only determine
whether the subject matter has been fully covered. Members may present subject
matter to the Solicitor for him to prepare legislation in the manner prescribed
by law.
(Ord. 1078. Passed 1-24-77.)
111.15  ATTENDANCE OF OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES AT MEETINGS.

consequences whatever they may be of failure to follow any Charter or statutory
provisions, shall not render void or ineffective any action of Council.

by a majority of those persons

115.10  OPEN MEETINGS; EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   (a)    Al1 meetings of all bodies of this Municipality are hereby declared
to be public meetings open to the public at all times.
(Ord. 1100. Passed 2-28-77.)
   (b)    The members of a Municipal body may hold an executive session only
after a majority of a quorum of the Municipal body determines, by roll call
vote, to hold such a session and only at a regular or special meeting for the
sole purpose of the consideration of any of the following matters, which matter
or matters shall be stated in the motion:
      (1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, no Municipal body shall hold an executive session
for the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the
performance of his official duties or for his removal from office. If a
Municipal body holds an executive session pursuant to this section, the motion
and vote to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the
approved purposes listed in this section are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting.
      (2)    To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member of a Municipal body shall use this division as a subterfuge
for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase
or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public
property has received covert information from a member of a Municipal body that
has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers. If the minutes of
the Municipal body show that all meetings and deliberations of the Municipal
body have been conducted in compliance with this section, any instrument
executed by the Municipal body purporting to convey, lease, or otherwise
dispose of any right, title, or interest in any public property shall be
conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with this section
insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees, or
transferees of the property is concerned.
      (3)    Conferences with an attorney for the Municipal body concerning
disputes involving the Municipal body that are the subject of pending or
imminent court action.
      (4)    Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment.
      (5)    Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules
or State statutes.
      (6)    Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
      (7)    Any other matter appropriate for discussion in executive session
under the law.
   (c)    The minutes of an executive session held under this section need only
reflect the general subject matter of discussions.
(Ord. 94-015. Passed 5-9-94.)
115.11  GENERAL.
   (a)    When the Clerk gives oral or written notice of a special meeting, he
shall state the specific or general purpose of the special meeting then known
to him and may state that any other business that may properly come before the
Municipal body at such special meeting may be considered and acted upon.
   (b)    When the Clerk gives written notice, he may do so by supplying a copy
of the agenda of the meeting in question so long as it sets forth the purpose
or purposes of the meeting, if it is a special meeting.
   (c)    A reasonable attempt at notification shall constitute notification in
compliance with this chapter.
   (d)    Failure of any Municipal body of this Municipality to strictly adhere
to these rules shall not render void or ineffective any action of that body,
providing that there is substantial compliance and no prejudice occurs.
   (e)    The minutes of a regular or special meeting of a Municipal body shall
be promptly prepared, filed, and maintained and shall be open to public
inspection.
   (f)    The minutes of a regular or special meeting of Council shall conclude
with this sentence: "All meetings and deliberations of Rossford Municipal
bodies, including this meeting, at which subjects were acted upon as reported
herein, have been conducted in accordance with the Ohio Open Meetings
statutes."
   (g)    It is the intention of this chapter to comply with Ohio law relating
to open meetings, as such law presently exists and as it may be amended from
time to time by the Ohio legislature.
   (h)    If any section or part of this chapter is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such finding shall affect only such
section or part of this chapter.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.  Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a
jury  at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution. 
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon  criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

and/or earning and/or receiving income in the City of Rossford. 
Individuals
   (A)    For residents of the City of Rossford the income tax levied herein
shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including
the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities
owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident.  This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
194.02 (C)(16)).
   (B)    For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)     For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
194.02 (C)(21).  Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

         (a)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to Rossford with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City of
Rossford each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of Rossford income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to Rossford, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
of Rossford for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
Rossford for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in Rossford
for all or part of the taxable year.

residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the City

the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Rossford to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
 194.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Rossford
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Rossford, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the

         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
194.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
194.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

vendor, customer, client, or patient.

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Rossford.  The City of
Rossford shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the
purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal

earned and/or received by each employee in Rossford.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
194.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
 194.03 Imposition of Tax, of this ordinance, of  2.25%. An employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,

qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.   
   
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax

or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted

total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Rossford in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Rossford. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the  Tax Administrator and Rossford as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Rossford income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to Rossford the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
Rossford income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Rossford until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:

calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold Rossford income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this ordinance to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer in Rossford than in any other municipal corporation on

another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described

      (2)     Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Rossford income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.  The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to Rossford, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
ordinance.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice

perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.

request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Rossford to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal

section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to Rossford . No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not

the taxpayer’s taxable year.  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return
or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City of Rossford.  No remittance
is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Rossford's income tax
return. The extended due date of Rossford's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Rossford's income tax return.
         (b)     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Rossford income tax return.  If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Rossford income tax return
is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
Rossford's income tax return. The extended due date of Rossford's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Rossford, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, Rossford shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Rossford for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with Rossford an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Rossford income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both of the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the City of
Rossford for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
 194.04(C)(1)(g)) within Rossford.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides service in Rossford and does
not expect to be subject to Rossford income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Rossford.  The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City of Rossford, make any sales in Rossford, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by Rossford during the taxable year.  If the affiant
does become subject to the tax levied by the City of Rossford for the taxable
year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as
a taxpayer with Rossford income tax ordinance and rules and regulations".  The
person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator, shall not require the person to file any tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for Rossford by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
194.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Rossford, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Rossford and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by Rossford to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Rossford, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Rossford
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
ordinance and of Rossford's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the

Extension for service in or for the armed forces
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Rossford for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by Rossford during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this ordinance. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Rossford's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown. 
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Rossford income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to Rossford. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Rossford income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated
Rossford income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the
taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to
file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Rossford income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
194.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Rossford income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1) to the
extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment
has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Rossford income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
194.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
194.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
194.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Rossford;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Rossford income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this ordinance on the basis
of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Rossford income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
194.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Rossford income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Rossford in accordance with this ordinance on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Rossford before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with Rossford may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this ordinance,
may claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this ordinance upon
satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject

municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other Municipality is

tax in the other Municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other Municipality by the tax rate for
that Municipality.

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
 194.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless

percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
Rossford under Section
194.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Rossford but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15; Ord. 2017-68.  Passed 12-11-17.)
194.08   ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.  (Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.09   REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
194.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
194.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with Rossford, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Rossford as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Rossford is subject to recovery by Rossford.  If
Rossford's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Rossford shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Rossford claims is
due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid
to the first municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If Rossford's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Rossford's tax rate.  However, if Rossford's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other Municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Rossford, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15; Ord. 2017-68.  Passed 12-11-17.)
194.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for Rossford changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Rossford. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
194.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
194.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Rossford. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
194.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Rossford tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Rossford return showing income subject to
Rossford income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Rossford income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time as the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
194.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
194.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Rossford does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section 194.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of
Section
194.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Rossford income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.  (Ord. 2015-
51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Rossford official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Rossford
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Rossford that arises pursuant to Rossford's income tax imposed in accordance
with this ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Rossford as
authorized by this ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this ordinance and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit Rossford from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)
194.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Rossford ordinance or state law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud Rossford or the Tax Administrator.

194.18  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)    As used in this section:

      (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,
schedule, and other document required to be filed with the Tax Administrator or

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Rossford on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Rossford to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fail, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

penalty, amount of interest, charges, or additional fees that Rossford has
properly imposed or collected before January 1, 2016.
   (E)    Nothing in this section limits the authority of Rossford to abate or

194.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority
   (A)    Nothing in this ordinance shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under Rossford's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written

         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or

      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability
 
   (B)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
ordinance for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if
no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this ordinance. Upon
written request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this ordinance shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by Rossford or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this ordinance prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this ordinance
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
194.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
194.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
194.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
194.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
194.99 for a violation of Section
194.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
            (Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.  Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.  (Ord. 2015-51.  Passed 11-9-15.)

   (A)   (1)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of Rossford, but such
appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
Rossford at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor
of Rossford. This member may be an employee of Rossford,
but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review shall be two

official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons

within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

195.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation
of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several structures.
   (b)    “Transient accommodation” means every establishment kept, used,
maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered to guests in which four or less rooms are used for
the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (c)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (d)    "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel
or  transient accommodation and who furnishes the lodging.
      (Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.02  TAX ESTABLISHED; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to provide for
economic development, community promotion and for use of the general revenue
fund, an excise tax is hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a
hotel or transient accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
   (b)    The tax is six percent (6%) of the amount paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging. The tax applies and is collectible at the time
the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax
does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or any of its political
subdivisions.
   (c)    For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels or transient accommodations in this Municipality to transient guests is
subject to the tax until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 2010. Passed 6-25-90.)
195.03  PAYMENT BY TRANSIENT GUEST; CERTIFICATE OF EXEMPTION.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
vendor and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.04  REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Tax Commissioner shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was
paid by the transient guest directly to the Tax Commissioner or his agent, he
shall refund to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the Tax
Commissioner on the form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date it
is ascertained that the assessment of payment was illegal or erroneous;
provided, however, that in any event such application for refund must be filed
with the Tax Commissioner within four years from the date of the illegal or
erroneous payment of the tax. On the filing of such application, the Tax
Commissioner shall determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount
to the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall draw a warrant for such
certified amount on the Finance Director to the person claiming such refund.
The Finance Director shall make such payments from a tax refund fund as
established by ordinance.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.05  REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due provided in this chapter, and he shall keep all invoices and other
pertinent documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax,
the vendor's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the
sale was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction
if exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be
open during business hours for the inspection of the Tax Commissioner. They
shall be reserved for a period of four years, unless the Tax Commissioner, in
writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires
them to be kept longer.
(Ord.  982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.06  VENDOR TO FILE RETURNS; TAX COMMISSIONER'S POWERS.
   Each vendor shall on or before the twentieth day of each month make and file
a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner,
showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the
vendor to the Municipality for the period covered by the return and such other
information as the Tax Commissioner deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. The Tax Commissioner may extend the time for
making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by mail to the Finance
Director, together with payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
   The Tax Commissioner may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such
as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Tax Commissioner upon the
basis of administrative costs to the Municipality, to make and file returns at
less frequent intervals.    Such authorization shall be in writing and shall
indicate the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   The Tax Commissioner shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date
received by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the amount of
payment received with the return. Thereafter, the Finance Director shall
immediately transmit all returns filed under this chapter to the Tax
Commissioner. Any vendor who fails to file a return under this chapter shall,
for each day he so fails, forfeit and pay into the Treasury one dollar ($1.00).
   The Tax Commissioner, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to
be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the
vendor or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.07  LIABILITY; ASSESSMENT NOTICE; REASSESSMENT PETITION; FEE; PAYMENT.
   (a)    If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter
and fails to remit the same to the Municipality as prescribed, he shall be
personally liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Tax
Commissioner may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any
information in the Tax Commissioner's possession.
   (b)    If any vendor fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails
to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction
subject to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable
for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Tax Commissioner
may make an assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the
facts may require, based upon any information in his possession.
   (c)    An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable
to such transaction.
   (d)    In each case the Tax Commissioner shall give to the vendor or
transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment.  Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest personally or by registered or
certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to
an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if the tax has actually been
paid by another.
   (e)    The Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against any vendor who
fails to file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper
amount of tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the
possession of the Tax Commissioner indicates that the amount required to be
collected is, or should be, greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the
Tax Commissioner may, upon the basis of test checks of a vendor's business for
a representative period which are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which
the tax required to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's or
transient accommodation's lodgings, which determination shall be the basis of
an assessment as provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall be
made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (f)    Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom notice of assessment is
directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either personally or
by registered or certified mail, a petition in writing, verified under oath by
the vendor, transient guest or his authorized agent, having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with particularity, the items of the assessment objected
to, together with the reasons for such objections, the assessment shall become
conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable, from the vendor or
transient guests so assessed, to the Finance Director. When a petition for
reassessment is filed, the Tax Commissioner shall assign a time and place for
the hearing thereof and shall notify the petitioner thereof by registered or
certified mail, but the Tax Commissioner may continue the hearings from time to
time if necessary.
   (g)    A penalty of fifteen percent shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Tax Commissioner may adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added
to assessments made under this chapter.
   (h)    When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Tax Commissioner,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days
after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.08  FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)    When the Tax Commissioner has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging which were not
returned to the City;
   (b)    When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
      (Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.09  NONPAYMENT AND FALSE INFORMATION BY TRANSIENT GUEST.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.10  VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, paying the tax for the transient guest by
an adjustment of prices, furnishing lodging at a price including the tax or
rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.11  REPORT FILING; FRAUDULENT REPORTS; FAILURE TO FILE REPORTS; SECURITY TO
BE PAID.
   (a)    No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)    If any vendor required to file monthly returns by this chapter fails,
on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve month
period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if any
vendor authorized by the Tax Commissioner to file returns at less frequent
intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month period, to
file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Tax Commissioner
may require the vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the average
tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by the Tax
Commissioner from a review of returns or other information pertaining to the
vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars
($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax payment to be
applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond,
satisfactory to the Tax Commissioner, conditioned upon payment of the tax due
with the returns from the vendor. The security must be filed within ten days
following the vendor's receipt of the notice from the Tax Commissioner of its
requirements.
   (c)    A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to
the vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.12  PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the Municipality under the provisions of this chapter fails for any reason to
make such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer’s or employee’s liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.13  PURPOSE TO LEVY 3% EXCISE TAX
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent on
transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient
guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.02(C), and further, to
levy an excise tax of three percent on transactions by which lodging by
transient accommodations is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
Accordingly, this chapter shall be construed to effectuate those purposes and
so as to be consistent with any requirement of law compliance with which is a
prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 982. Passed 11-11-74.)
195.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any section of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be subject to a fine of not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisonment for a term of up to six months,
or both.

of four years, unless the Finance Director, in writing, consents to their
destruction within that period, or, in writing, directs that such records shall
be maintained for a longer period.

unpaid tax is hereby imposed in the amount of one and one-half percent (1½%)
percent per month or fraction thereof.

competent jurisdiction to collect unpaid taxes, interest and penalties, and

charge. The fee for the license shall be one dollar ($1.00), which license

duplicate original copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place at each
place where admissions subject to the tax imposed under this chapter are made.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately

to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall

operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.

the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;

manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more

property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which

governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation.
   The Chief of Police, may send notice by certified mail with return receipt
requested, to the person having the right to the possession of the property on

garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.

days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. 
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)
 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.

subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive

the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
               The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program.  The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may
impose on the offender any other conditions of community control that it

under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be marked by a
sign indicating the end of the zone.  Nothing in this section or in the manual

each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   No person shall receive a driver's license, or a motorcycle operator's
endorsement of a driver's or commercial driver's license, unless and until he
surrenders to the Registrar all valid licenses issued to him by another
jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio.  No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.  The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates.  If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense.  If issued, the order shall

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

The proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed
in accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination.  If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the

to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has

any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a mentally retarded,
developmentally disabled, or physically impaired child under twenty-one years
of age shall not begin to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.    (ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13  PAYMENT OF COST OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of a criminal offense pursuant to the Municipal
Code in the Perrysburg Municipal Court, other than a minor misdemeanor, and as
a consequence of such conviction is confined in the County Jail or workhouse as
provided in Ohio R.C. 1905.35, shall reimburse the City for its expenses
incurred by reason of such confinement, including, but not limited to, the
expenses relating to the provision of food, clothing and shelter.
   (b)   The amount of the reimbursement required to be made by the inmate
shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (c)   The Law Director is hereby authorized to institute an appropriate
civil action in the name of the City, in the Court of Common Pleas of the
county in which the County Jail or workhouse is located, to recover from the
inmate the reimbursement for the expenses of his confinement as determined in
accordance with subsection (b).
(Ord.  98-019.  Passed 4-13-98.)
501.14  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the

elevation below the basement floor.  No building sewer shall be laid parallel
to and within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. 
The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.  The building
sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as
possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and
fittings. Any public or private utility service structure or line shall be
maintained at a minimum of five (5) feet horizontal clearance between said
building sewer and said utility, except for water lines which shall be
maintained at a minimum of ten (10) feet horizontal clearance unless written
approval is secured by person making application from the City Inspector. Any
part of the building sewer that is located within 10 feet of a water line shall

914.12  EXCAVATIONS; REQUIREMENTS.
   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be
open trench work unless otherwise requested by the City Inspector. Pipe laying
and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C 12
except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected. (See
Appendix No. 1 - Recommended Practice for Installing Vitrified Clay Sewer Pipe
and No. 2, Figure 1, Trench Detail).
(Ord. 98-038.  Passed 9-14-98.)
914.13  CONNECTIONS TO BE GASTIGHT AND WATERTIGHT.
   All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight.
(Ord. 98-038.  Passed 9-14-98.)
914.14  CONNECTIONS; OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   The City cannot guarantee the exact location of any existing wye, tee, riser
or crossover. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
be made at a riser or wye, if such outlet is available at a suitable location.
Where no properly located riser or wye is available in the public sewer the
owner shall at his expense cut a neat hole into the public sewer to receive the
building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about
forty-five degrees and at the location specified by the City Inspector. The
connection of the building sewer to the public sewer shall in general be above
and near the spring line of  the sewer, but never in the top of the public
sewer. A forty-five degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the
spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer.
A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and
watertight by approved waterproof joint material before encasing in concrete.
Concrete encasement shall not be considered waterproof. Special fittings may be
used for the connection only when approved by the City Inspector. (See Appendix
No. 3, Figure 2 for construction details of the building sewer connections).
Any damage to the main sewer pipe during installation of the connection shall
require replacement of the entire length of main sewer pipe damaged, at the
sewer contractor's expense.
(Ord. 98-038.  Passed 9-14-98.)
914.15  CITY INSPECTOR TO BE NOTIFIED; INSPECTIONS.
   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the City Inspector
forty-eight (48) hours before an inspection and connection to the public sewer
is to be made. All notifications of this kind shall include the permit number
and the location. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
City Inspector or his representative. The City Inspector, or any person
authorized by him must be permitted at all times to inspect all work, material
and fixtures.
(Ord. 98-038.  Passed 9-14-98.)
914.16  EXCAVATIONS; RESTORATION OF PROPERTY.
   All excavations for the building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, driveways, sewers, utilities and other public or private
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the City. No sewer contractor shall open any pavement on any
public or private property without first receiving written permission from the
Administrator or proper authorities. At least 48 hours notice shall be given
for this permission. Where the trench method is used through paved or unpaved
streets, roads, driveways, alleys etc. it will be necessary to use granular
material, preferably sand or limestone screenings for backfill. It shall be
placed in layers of not more than six (6) inches and tamped with a mechanical
tamp or puddled in layers at the direction of the City Inspector. After the
backfill is thoroughly compacted, it will be necessary to replace the pavement
with the same type of materials as were removed, and in no case shall
substitute paving materials be used without first securing the approval of the
proper authority. All surplus excavation must be removed from the site to a
location satisfactory to the City, leaving the berms and pavement in
substantially the same condition as it was before construction was started. All
of the above mentioned work and material shall be performed in accordance with
the standard specifications of the Ohio Department of Transportation and the
City or other proper authorities. At all joints where the building sewer passes
under another sewer, drainage pipe, water main or other utility, the line
passed under must be supported by 4" x 4" wood timbers, brick or concrete
masonry and extra precaution will be required in backfilling and tamping the
trench in order  to avoid any danger of a break, settlement or crack in the
line passed under.
(Ord. 98-038.  Passed 9-14-98.)
914.17  REPAIR WORK; STOPPAGES.
   A building sewer permit shall be required for all repair work performed by
the sewer contractor except cases where excavation is not necessary. In the
case of stoppages it shall be the responsibility of the sewer contractor to
uncover the wye, tee or riser, if the property is on the same side as the main
sewer. When the property is on the opposite side, the end of the City crossover
shall be uncovered to determine where the trouble lies. If the stoppage is
found to be either in the main line or in the City crossover, the sewer
contractor shall notify the City Inspector immediately, whose responsibility it
shall be to repair same. The cost of the permit will then be returned to the
sewer contractor. If the stoppage is located anywhere else in the line, it
shall be the responsibility of the owner to repair same at his own cost and
expense.
(Ord. 98-038.  Passed 9-14-98.)
914.18  NONCOMPLIANCE; CITY TO DO WORK; COSTS.
   If any Sewer Contractor shall neglect or refuse to comply with the rules and
regulations herein set forth, within twenty-four (24) hours after receiving
written notice from  the Administrator, the City of Rossford will proceed with
the work and the cost involved will be charged to the Sewer Contractor or his
Surety. In cases where it is necessary for the City to proceed with the work,

933.05  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy these standards
shall meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development manual, the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide
for the Wood County, or the Ohio EPA standards, whichever are more stringent.
   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right of the
City Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent requirements,
nor shall the standards limit the right of the City Engineer to waive, in
writing, individual requirements where reasonably necessary and based upon
sound engineering practice.
   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of the
County soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (a)     The Storm Water Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so
as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)     Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.
   (c)     Sediment Barriers.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment.  Where intended to provide sediment control,
Silt Fence shall be placed on a level contour.  The relationship between the
maximum drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the
table below.
Table 1:  Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage
                                        area (in percent)
   0.5                               < 2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
 
This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control
sheet flow runoff.  The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall
not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier.  Straw bale barriers
are not acceptable.
   (d)     Storm Water Diversion Practices.  Storm water diversion practices
shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Such practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, pipe slope
drains and diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres.  Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)     All Sediment Control Practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)     Clearing and Grubbingwill be done in two (2) or more phases.  The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs.  After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)     Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices.  Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of earth disturbing activity. 
Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended to trap
sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is permanently restabilized.  As construction progresses and
the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)     Stabilization of Denuded Areas.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized
as specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm
Water Permit Rules, whichever are most restrictive.
Table 2:  Permanent Stabilization

                                                                    inspect the lot to ensure that the temporary seeding has been done.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over winter                       Prior to the onset of winter weather.
 
Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or
are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
   (i)     Sediment Settling Ponds:  Storm water runoff that exceeds the design
capacity of sediment barriers and concentrated storm water flows shall pass
through a sediment settling facility.
      (1)    Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres
disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must
be provided until final stabilization of the site.  In single-family
residential construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and
permanent landscaping is done.
             A.     Alternative equivalent controls may be used if the owner
can show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives in the
(Ohio EPA NPDES Permit for Construction Activity) Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) for the site.
             B.     It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than
10 acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or Sediment Traps be used.
      (2)     Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than sixty-
seven (67) cubic yards per acre of total contributing drainage area.  The
storage volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the
primary (principal) spillway.
      (3)     Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water.  The draw down time must be at least 72 hours, or meet
the criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual which ever is
most stringent.
      (4)     The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (>2:1 length to width ratio).
      (5)     The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less than or
equal to five (5) feet.
      (6)     Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when
the design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (7)     Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design.  Alternative sediment controls must be used where
site limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)     Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (j)     Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
      (1)     All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the City Engineer.  In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (2)     Once final stabilization is accomplished, the developer/owner
shall remove the inlet protection devices and hydraulically clean the storm
sewers to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and the Public Works
Superintendent.  All sediment shall be removed from the system and shall not be
flushed downstream.
   (k)     Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets.  All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope.  The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream, channel banks, channel bottom or other areas in which the water
is outletted.
   (l)     Working Near, or Crossing Streams and Wetlands.
      (1)     Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks.  If construction vehicles must cross such
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be
constructed.  Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and
banks, shall be restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed,
interrupted, or stopped.  Erodible materials will not be used in making stream
crossings.
      (2)     No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource, unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)     If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)     No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed
in a stream channel.
   (m)     Construction Entrance.
      (1)     Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)     Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be
implemented as required by the City Engineer and the Ohio EPA.  These will be
planned and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition
of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)    Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety.  Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping.  Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed.
      (4)     Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs.  Non-erosive materials (for example, wood and stone)
can be used.
   (n)     Unstable Soils.
      (1)     Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)     The City Engineer may require detailed soil reports when deemed
necessary.
      (3)     Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)     Cut and Fill Slopes.  Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage.  Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization.  The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ration of 3:
1 (the horizontal will be three (3) times the vertical).
   (p)     Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels.  Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding.  The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed.
   (q)     Establishment of Permanent Vegetation.  A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized. 
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the City Engineer, has 80% vegetative density
over the entire disturbed area, provides adequate cover, and is mature enough
to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse weather conditions.
   (r)     Disposition of Temporary Practices.  All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the City Engineer.  Trapped sediment shall
be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion.
   (s)     Underground Utility Construction.  The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)     Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)    There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state.
      (3)     When discharging clean ground water, care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)     Inspections.
      (1)     If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)     The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected
for soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven
(7) calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the City Engineer or designee inspects and verifies the
site as being stable.  Such verification does not relieve the permitee from
meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)     The owner, or owner's designated representative, shall keep a
written log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements to the soil
erosion, sediment control or other environmental controls.  The inspections
shall include the date of inspection, the name of the inspector, weather
conditions, and the actions needed to correct the identified problems.
      (4)     The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (5)     If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all the required inspection sheets will be submitted to the
City Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the inspection was
conducted.
      (6)     Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)     Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Management and Sediment and Erosion Control Plan shall be observed to ensure
that they are operating correctly.
      (8)     Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving waters.
      (9)     Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
             (10)     If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in
need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds,
it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. 
Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of
the inspection.
             (11)     If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails
to perform its intended function and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the Storm Water Management and Sediment and Erosion
Control Plan must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within 10 days of the inspection.
           (12)     If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not
been implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed
within ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
           (13)     If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice
is not needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)     Control of Materials and Debris.  Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the City of Rossford's water resources or wetlands.  These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)     A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper
disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall,
grout, gypsum and other such materials.  A second covered dumpster will be
provided for the proper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)     Excess concrete material shall not be washed into a street, catch
basin, other public facility or natural resource.  A designated area shall be
made available and used for all concrete washouts.
      (3)     All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage
area.  A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum
capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the storage
area.  All additional requirements of the local fire authority must be
followed.  If the fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will be
maintained in the "dike" tank at all times.
      (4)     Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes.  Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)     On a site with a prior industrial landuse or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminants, the storm water is considered wastewater.  A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)     Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on
solid waste landfill sites.
      (7)     Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint
wastes are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations.  Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of such wastes into surface or
ground waters.
             A.     Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of
excess water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected
sanitary sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
             B.     All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning
materials will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)     Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all
times that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the
construction.
      (9)     All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (v)     Pre-winter Stabilization.  If the development area will, or is
planned to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the
development area shall hold a pre-winter stabilization meeting before October
1st.  The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer, contractor,
City Engineer and anyone else requested by the City Engineer to the meeting.
      (Ord. 2012-38.  Passed 8-27-12.)
933.06  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and volumes
may include, but are not limited to permanent retention ponds and lakes, dry
detention basins, and subsurface detention tanks.
   (a)     Storm Water Basins.
      (1)     Pool geometry.  The recommended length-to-width ratio for the
pond is 3:1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)     Riser in embankment.  The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access.  Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)     Water drains.  Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that
can completely drain the pond.  The drain shall have an elbow within the pond
to prevent sediment deposits from plugging the drain.
      (4)     Adjustable gate valves.  Both the storm water management and
water quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves.  Valves shall be
located inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner.  During annual inspections the valves
shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official
shall attest to this on the inspection form.  To prevent vandalism, the
handwheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)     Principal spillway.  Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county.  Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow.  The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser.  The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest.  Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location.  Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)     Emergency spillway.  An emergency spillway shall be provided on
each storm water management basin.  Emergency spillways shall convey flood
flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. 
Emergency spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted
in writing by the City Engineer.
   (b)     Embankments.  Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development manual, the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide
for Wood County, the Ohio EPA standards, and Chapter 1059-Ponds, Lakes,
Embankments, Reservoirs or Other Impoundments of Water, whichever are more
stringent.  Anti-seep collars shall be proved for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.
      (1)     Safety features.
             A.     The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
             B.     The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than
three (3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.     A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline.  This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool.  The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.     Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.     An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations.  The aquatic bench may be landscaped to
prevent access to the deeper water pool.
            4.     Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.    The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.     Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and
shall terminate on a safety bench.
   (c)     Runoff Rate.  The peak runoff rate from the development area shall
not be greater after development than it was before development.  The applicant
shall provide calculations demonstrating no increases in the runoff rates from
the one (1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one
hundred (100) year storms.
   (d)     Runoff Volume.  Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates.  Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area.  The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre-development storm runoff rate.  The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)     Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)     From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development (2) using this percentage,
select the critical storm from this table:
Table 4:  Critical Storm Selection
The Percentage Increase In volume of Runoff is:
 
Equal To or  And Less The 24-Hour
Greater Than Than     “Critical Storm”
                      For Discharge Will Be
0            10       1 Year
10           20       2 Years
20           50       5 Years
50           100      10 Years
100          250      25 Years
250          500      50 Years
500          ---      100 Years
 
   (e)     Water Quality.  To meet the post-construction requirements of this
Chapter, the Storm Water Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Plan must
contain a description of the Post-Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs)
that will be installed during construction for the site and the rationale for
their selection.  The rationale must address the anticipated impacts on the
channel and floodplain morphology, hydrology, and water quality.
      (1)     Structural BMPs.  Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
             A.     Properly Sized BMPs.  The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to
treat the water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water
Quality Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1.  The WQv shall be equivalent to the
volume of runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to
one of the two following methods:
            1.     Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City
Engineer authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and local long-
term hourly precipitation records; or
            2.     Using the following equation:
            WQv    = C * P * A/12 where:
            WQv    = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C    = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than
                          1 inch (see Table 5)
                  P    = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A   = area draining into the BMP in acres.
Table 5:  Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (> 8 dwellings/acre)      0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (< 4 dwellings/acre)       0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
             B.     Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient
should be calculated using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the
contributing drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low
Density Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space,
the runoff coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)
(0.2) = 0.35.
             C.     An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall
be incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity.  The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
             D.     BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long
enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as described in Table 6 below:
Table 6:  Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural
Post-Construction Treatment Control Practices
 
Best Management Practice                    Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration                                24 - 48 Hours
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip            24 Hours
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basin)        48 Hours
Retention Basins (Wet Basins)*              24 Hours
Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 Hours
Media Filtration, Bioretention              40 Hours
 
          *   Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume
above the permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQv
             E.     The owner may request approval from the City Engineer to
utilize alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can
demonstrate, in a way that is consistent with Ohio EPA rules and regulations,
that the alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in
Table 6 above.  The use of alternative or vendor supplied Post-Construction
BMPs should be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is
provided that the traditional BMPs in Table 6 are technically and economically
unfeasible.   
             F.     Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition
if it can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing
structural Post-Construction BMP which is part of a larger common plan of
development or sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a
regional or local storm water management plan.
             G.     For redevelopment projects (namely, developments on
previously developed property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure
a 20 percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment
of at least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (2)     Water quality basin.  If a Water Quality Basin is needed and
cannot be incorporated into an existing or planned Detention or Retention Basin
then a separate Water Quality Basin will need to be planned, designed,
constructed and maintained into perpetuity.
   (f)     The requirements shall be satisfied at each location where runoff
leaves the development area.  The runoff rates and volumes shall be considered
for both the conditions before and after development at these locations.
   (g)     To ensure the continued functioning of storm water control
structures, the following information shall be identified to the satisfaction
of the City Engineer.
      (1)     The person or entity responsible for continued maintenance of the
storm water control structure shall be identified to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer.
      (2)     Maintenance requirements and schedules;
      (3)     Permanent access easements required for those conducting
maintenance to perform inspection and maintenance of storm water control
structures and storm water conveyance systems.  The minimum size of an easement
shall be approved by the City Engineer.  Within such easements, no person shall
plant trees, shrubbery, plantings, or construct buildings, fences, or walls
that obstruct free flow of storm water or obstruct the movement of construction
equipment.
      (4)     An owner or owners of two or more existing or proposed lots may
apply for approval of a SWM plan serving more than one lot.  Such plan shall
comply with applicable provisions of this chapter and all other relevant laws
and ordinances.  No subdivision of lands or building permit shall be approved
under any multiple lot plan until owners of all affected lots have entered into
a mutual agreement or formed an association for joint maintenance of the SWM
facility and until all easements needed to effectuate the plan have been
granted.  The mutual agreement or association and the easements must be signed,
acknowledged, delivered and recorded in the manner for documents relating to
real estate titles.
   (h)     Detention or retention basin exemption for development or for
expansion of existing facilities:
      (1)     For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction
of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if
the post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
causes no increase to the existing peak discharge using the TR-55 method of
calculation or other method approved by the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 2012-38.  Passed 8-27-12.)
933.07   COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
   (a)     NPDES Permits.  The provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permits, issued by the Ohio EPA, shall be followed. 
Proof of compliance shall be, but is not limited to, a copy of the Ohio EPA
NPDES Permit number, or a letter from the site owner explaining why the NPDES
Permit is not applicable.  Such written proof will be provided to the City
Engineer before a construction permit will be issued.
   (b)     Federal and State Wetland Permits.  The provisions of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers dredge and fill permits for federally-protected wetlands
shall be followed.  The provisions of Ohio EPA's Isolated Wetlands Permits
shall also be followed.  Wetlands and other waters of the United States shall
be delineated by protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
Ohio EPA at the time of application of these regulations.  Written proof of
compliance with both permit programs will be provided to the City Engineer
prior to final Planning Commission approval.  Proof of compliance shall be, but
is not limited to, the following:
      (1)     A copy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Individual Permit, if
required for the project, showing project approval and any restrictions that
apply to site activities; or
      (2)     A site plan showing that any proposed fill of waters of the
United States conforms to the general and specific conditions specified in the
applicable Nationwide Permit; or
      (3)     A letter from the site owner verifying that a qualified
professional has surveyed the site and found no wetlands or other waters of the
United States.  Such a letter shall be noted on site plans submitted to the
City.
         (Ord. 2012-38.  Passed 8-27-12.)
933.08  SENSITIVE AREA IMPACT CRITERIA.
   (a)     The control of sediment pollution of sensitive areas by accelerated
erosion from earth disturbing activity may require additional erosion and
sediment control practices beyond those indicated in this Chapter.  In such
instances the developer/owner shall analyze potential impacts, potential
erosion, and sediment control practices.
   (b)     Such analysis shall identify the following:
      (1)     Sensitive areas that receive drainage from the proposed
development.
      (2)     Existing water uses and biological characteristics of receiving
waters.
      (3)     The probability of sediment reaching sensitive areas.
      (4)     The percentage of the sensitive area's contributing drainage area
that is proposed for the earth disturbing activity.
   (c)     Information gained by the analysis shall be incorporated into the
erosion and sediment control plan, and taken into consideration by the City
during the review process.  The City Engineer shall make the final decision
concerning the limits of any sensitive area.
(Ord. 2012-38.  Passed 8-27-12.)
933.09  CONTINUING DUTY TO MAINTAIN; NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (a)     Any portion of the drainage system on private property, including
storm water storage facilities, shall be continuously maintained by the
property owner, unless such system or portion thereof is officially accepted by
the City for maintenance.
   (b)     The owner of a storage facility is charged with the duty of

934.05  DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition Against Illicit Discharges.  No person shall cause or
allow an illicit discharge into the MS4, nor shall any person place or allow
the placement of any pollution in a location where it can cause an illicit
discharge into the MS4.
   The following discharges are exempt from the discharge prohibitions of this

connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)     A person is considered to be in violation of this section if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
         (Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.06  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations.  The
authorized enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or waters of the United States.  If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.
      (1)     Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter
may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge.  The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.  The violator may petition the
authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
      (2)     A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access
to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of
the authorized enforcement agency.
         (Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.07  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.  Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.08  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability.  This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with residential, commercial, industrial or
institutional activity, including construction activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)     The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.  If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry onto its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)     Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all areas of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be maintained under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and for the performance
of any additional duties as defined by State and federal law.
      (3)     The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up
on any permitted facility any such devices as are necessary in the opinion of
the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)     The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary.  The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.  All
devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)     Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
      (6)     Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is itself a violation of a storm water discharge
permit and of this chapter.  A person who is the operator of a facility with a
NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any
activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)     If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to
any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.09  BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying BMPs
for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or water of
the United States.  The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. 
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer
system.  Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section.  These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention
plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.10  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse.  In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structure will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse.  (Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.11  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment
and cleanup of such release.  In the event of such release of hazardous
materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.  In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement
agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. 
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency within three business
days of the phone notice.  If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence.
(Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.12  CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other City provisions of law, ordinance, contract or
deed, then in such event the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of this chapter invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   This chapter shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property.  Neither shall
compliance with the provisions of this chapter constitute a defense in any
action to abate such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve any person
from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and
shall not result in the City, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therein.
(Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)
934.13  NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS.
   Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds that a person has violated
a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, then the
authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of
violation to the responsible person.  In instances where immediate action is
deemed necessary for public safety or the public interest, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance verbally, pending issuance of a written
order.  Such notice may require without limitation:
   (a)   The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
   (b)   The elimination of illicit discharges or illegal connections;
   (c)   Cessation and desist of the violating discharges, practices or
operations;

   (f)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed.  Said notice shall further advise that should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work shall be performed by the authorized enforcement agency or a contractor
designated by the City of Rossford, and the expense thereof shall be charged to
the violator.  (Ord. 2012-60.  Passed 11-12-12.)

thirty (30) days, or both, for each offense.  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.
   (b)     The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City, by or through its Law Director and/or authorized designees,
from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a court of proper
jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development or to restrain, enjoin, correct
or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of this
chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations or the
lawful orders of the authorized enforcement agency; or to impose any other
available civil remedy or sanction against any person or organization convicted

Certificate of Appropriateness shall rest with the Design Review Commission.
The Commission shall review an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
in accordance with its duties and responsibilities as listed in Section
1104.03(C) (Certificate of Appropriateness Review) and the appropriate design
review standards for the district as listed in Section
1134.02 (Design Review Overlay District Standards).
   (a)    Conflicts of Interest and Ex-Parte Communications. All conflicts of
interest and ex- parte communications of the applicant with Design Review
Commission members are to be disclosed at the beginning of the public hearing
by the Commission members. In addition, Commission members shall immediately
provide the City Administrator with a written summary of any ex-parte
communication with the applicant between the time of application and prior to a
decision on the application by the Commission for public review.
   (b)    Testimony. All testimony from the applicant or other parties of
interest shall be taken under oath.  Testimony from experts and non-experts
shall be limited to reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. All
testimony shall be subject to cross-examination.
   (c)    Deliberation. Upon close of the administrative hearing, the Design
Review Commission shall deliberate upon the application, make findings of fact,
and reach a decision. If time does not permit adequate deliberation, the matter
may be continued for a decision at a meeting open to the public at a date,
time, and place. If specified at the time of the continuance, no additional
notice of the meeting continuance need be made.
   (d)    Decision by the Commission. The Design Review Commission shall review
each application and approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or
disapprove such application within fifteen (15) days of the close of the
administrative hearing. The decision shall be issued in the form of a written,
Final Order in which the Commission expressly sets forth the findings and
conclusions of fact used as the basis or rationale for its decision.
      (1)    Approval.If the Design Review Commission determines that the
proposed activity will have no adverse effect on a designated Locally
Significant Resource or any standard of the applicable Design Review Overlay
District, the Commission shall approve the application.
      (2)    Approval with Modifications. The Design Review Commission may
approve the application with modifications or conditions placed upon the
approval regarding the proposed size, shape or materials proposed to be used in
constructing or installing the proposed improvements, or other limitations
necessary to maintain the local significance of the property or district, where
the applicant agrees to such modifications and conditions. Such conditions
shall be made part of any subsequent zoning approval.
      (3)    Disapproval. In the event that the Design Review Commission
determines that an application shall be disapproved, the Zoning Inspector shall
notify the applicant in writing within ten (10) calendar days of the reasons
for disapproval and may include recommendations regarding the proposed
construction activity. The Zoning Inspector shall not issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness or Zoning Permit for such project after a disapproval by the
Commission.
         A.   Upon disapproval, the Design Review Commission shall offer to
“stay” the Final Order and undertake continuing and meaningful discussions with
the applicant in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to both.
Such discussions shall extend over a period of at least thirty (30) days, but
shall not exceed six (6) months from the date of disapproval.
         B.   In the case of denial of an application for demolition, the
Design Review Commission shall offer to investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property, including purchase by a third party.
            1.   If the Design Review Commission and applicant cannot agree on
a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then the Commission
shall continue to schedule good faith meetings at least every forty-five (45)
days after the initial meeting. If the applicant fails to meet with the
Commission in good faith, at the time specified, then discussions may
terminate. Upon termination for any reason, the Commission shall inform the
applicant in writing of the termination of such good faith discussions and that
the Final Order for denial of the application shall stand.
            2.   If a compromise proposal is accepted by both the applicant and
the Design Review Commission, or if the Commission determines that preservation
of a structure proposed for demolition is not feasible, the Commission may
henceforth reverse its Final Order and issue a Certificate of Appropriateness.
         C.   If, after holding such good faith meeting(s) over the continued
discussion period specified by the Design Review Commission, no alternative
property use is developed or no offer to preserve the structure or
architecturally significant features is made by the applicant, the City, or a
third party, then the Commission may also consider whether failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and whether such Certificate may be issued without substantial
detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the
purposes of this Ordinance. In such event, the Commission may grant the
application, with or without modifications, and issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior
alteration or demolition.
   (e)    Certificate of Appropriateness. Upon approval by the Commission, the
Zoning Inspector shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness to the applicant
within ten (10) days thereafter. Any approved modifications or conditions shall
be stated upon the Certificate and made part of any subsequent zoning approval.
      (1)    A Certificate of Appropriateness is valid for one (1) year from
the date of approval. Unless the work described in the approval from the Design
Review Commission is commenced within one (1) year and continued progress is
made and is completed within two (2) years, the Certificate of Appropriateness
shall expire as a matter of law. The Commission may grant an extension of time
for good cause shown.
      (2)    Receiving a Certificate of Appropriateness does not negate
requirements to adhere to all other zoning and building regulations of the
City, County, and/or State.
      (3)    When a Certificate of Appropriateness is issued for demolition,
the applicant shall receive further written instruction that new in-fill
construction in the Design Review Overlay District is subject to review by the
Design Review Commission.

   (a)    In the event an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness is
denied by the Design Review Commission, the applicant shall have a right of
appeal to the Planning Commission.
   (b)    An appeal shall be taken by filing a notice of the appeal, specifying
the grounds thereof, with the City Administrative Offices within twenty (20)

Commission. The Administrative Offices will forward the appeal to the Planning
Commission, with a copy to the Chairman of the Design Review Commission.

ruling of the Commission shall be upheld or whether the Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be granted as requested within ten (10) calendar days
following the appeal hearing, unless additional time is necessary because of
unusual circumstances.
   (f)    The Planning Commission shall utilize the written findings of the
Design Review Commission to review economic, historic, architectural, and
aesthetic features of the subject structure, the nature and character of the
surrounding area, the use of such structure, and its cultural importance to the
City. A majority vote of the Planning Commission shall be required to overturn
a decision of the Design Review Commission.
   (g)    Decisions by the Planning Commission shall be deemed final
administrative orders for appellate purposes and any aggrieved person may file

CHAPTER 1111
Site Plan Review Procedures
1111.01   Site plan required.
1111.02   Access control requirements.
1111.03   Procedure for site plan review.
1111.04   Site plan submission  requirements.
1111.05   Site plan standards for review.
1111.06   Site plan content.
1111.07   Site plan fee.
1111.08   Performance guarantee.
1111.01  SITE PLAN REQUIRED.
   Any development in any zoning district requiring a Traffic Impact Study (See
Section
1136.17(e) (Access Control for High Traffic Volume Uses) or involving the
construction of five thousand (5,000) square feet gross floor area, shall be
required to submit a site plan in accordance with the requirement of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1111.02  ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   General standards for parking areas, circulation, and access shall be
incorporated as part of the site plan. These standards are found in Chapter
1136 (Off Street Parking, Loading and Access Control) of this Ordinance. As
part of the site plan review process, access shall be reviewed relative to the
distance from other drive approaches and from roadway intersections. The
preferred method of providing access to parcels is to minimize or eliminate
driveways by using service roads, rear access roads, or shared driveways. The
Planning Commission may, as part of the site plan review process, require that
driveways be moved, combined, realigned, or eliminated to reduce the potential
for accidents.
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
   
1111.03  PROCEDURE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)    Formal submission and approval of a site plan is required before any
zoning permit may be issued. Formal submission and approval of a site plan
includes following the review procedures and submission requirements defined
herein. Notwithstanding these requirements, however, at any time prior to the
formal submission and review of a site plan, an applicant may, at his or her
option, submit a sketch site plan to the Planning Commission for informal
review and comment. The purpose of such a sketch site plan is to provide an
opportunity to conceptually discuss a proposed development and to provide
general guidance to assist in the preparation of a formal site plan. A sketch
site plan need not include all items described in Section
1111.06 (Site Plan Content) and informal review of the site plan need not
include the notifications required under Section
1111.03(f) (Procedure for Site Plan Review - Notice by Posting Sign).
   (b)    In order to inform a developer of planning and zoning issues before
incurring substantial architectural and engineering costs for a project, the
site plan review process has a two- step procedure. The Planning Commission
shall conduct a preliminary site plan review so that it may determine that the
specific planning requirements of this Ordinance are being satisfied. Following
the preliminary site plan review, a developer shall submit detailed plans and
drawings for final site plan review by City divisions and departments. Both
preliminary and final site plan review may be conducted concurrently at the
option of the developer.
   (c)    The Planning Commission shall have authority to grant yard and area
variances and special exceptions from the terms of this Ordinance concurrent
with Site Plan review pursuant to Article X, Section 3 (Commissions and Boards)
of the City Charter. Variances shall only be granted according to the notice
and hearing procedures and standards for decisions outlined in Section 
1103.03 (Appeals and Hearings) and Section
1103.05 (Decisions of the Board of Zoning Appeals) of this Ordinance.
   (d)    An applicant for formal site plan approval shall file ten (10) copies
of a site plan with the Zoning Inspector along with other required documents
and an application fee.
   (e)    After reviewing an application for formal site plan approval for
completeness and determining that the application and site plan is complete,
the Zoning Inspector shall transmit copies of the site plan and application to
the members of the Planning Commission along with other departments and
agencies as deemed necessary. If all information required is not provided, the
Zoning Inspector shall promptly notify the applicant of the items needed.
   (f)    Within five (5) calendar days following the determination that the
application is complete, a sign providing general notice of the meeting on the
proposed development to be held by the Planning Commission shall be posted on
the property in question.
   (g)    Within thirty (30) calendar days following the determination that the
application is complete, the Planning Commission shall meet and consider the
proposed preliminary site plan, and shall make a decision concerning:
      (1)    The adequacy of the information presented to determine the impacts
of the proposed development compared with the standards established under
Section
1111.05 (Site Plan Standards for Review).
      (2)    Whether to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the site plan
along with any conditions or remedial measures to accommodate or mitigate the
expected impacts of the proposed development.
   (h)    The final action by the Planning Commission on a preliminary site
plan shall consist of either:
      (1)    Approval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed Preliminary Site Plan will constitute a suitable development and the
plan meets the standards set forth in this Ordinance. Within a one (1) year
period, unless extended for good cause by the Planning Commission, the
applicant shall apply for final site plan approval by the Zoning Inspector
pursuant to technical review by City divisions and departments.
      (2)    Approval of the site plan subject to any conditions,
modifications, and restrictions as required to ensure that the project meets
the standards for review. This approval is subject to final site plan approval
by the Zoning Inspector pursuant to technical review by City divisions and
departments. Within a one (1) year period, unless extended for good cause by
the Planning Commission, the applicant shall apply for final site plan approval
by the Zoning Inspector pursuant to technical review by City divisions and
departments. All conditions, modifications, and restrictions placed upon the
preliminary site plan approval by the Planning Commission shall be addressed in
the final site plan application materials and documents.
      (3)    Disapproval of the site plan based upon a determination that the

discuss the appeal at a second public hearing and shall make a decision whether
to grant the special use.
      (Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1112.03  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL SPECIAL USES.
   The Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances
of each proposed Special Use in terms finding that the proposed Special Use:
   (a)    Is in fact, a Special Use as established under the provisions of the
applicable zoning district.
   (b)    Will be in accordance with the general objectives or with any
specific objectives of the Master Plan.

      (Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1112.04  SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting approval for any Special Use, the Planning Commission may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformance with this
Ordinance. Any violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the Special Use is granted, shall be deemed a punishable
violation of this Ordinance. Examples of appropriate conditions and safeguards
include:
   (a)    Larger buffer areas between the proposed Special Use and adjacent
property.
   (b)    Greater yard requirements.
   (c)    Limits on the location or illumination of signs.

CHAPTER 1131
Districts, Boundaries, and Zoning Map
1131.01   Purpose; establishment.
1131.02   Zoning Map; interpretation of boundaries.
1131.01  PURPOSE; ESTABLISHMENT.
   In order to classify, regulate, and restrict the location of trades,
residences, recreation, and other uses, and the buildings designed for special
uses, to regulate and limit the height, bulk, number of stories, and size of
buildings and other structures, hereafter erected or altered, to regulate and
limit the percentage of lot area which may be occupied, setback building lines,
size of yards, courts, and open spaces within the buildings and surrounding
such buildings, and the density of population, the territory within the City of
Rossford is hereby divided into Zoning Districts as follows:
A Agricultural District
This District provides areas for plant cultivation, greenhouses, and other
related agricultural activities. This District can also be used as a "holding"
district. In this fashion, Agricultural zoning would remain until urban
development becomes appropriate. At that time, zoning to accommodate urban or
suburban densities of use can be considered which are consistent with the
adopted community plans.
P Public Lands 
This District is designed to classify publicly-owned uses and permits the
normal principal and incidental uses required to carry out governmental
functions and services. It is the intent of the Public Land District to
encourage the development of attractive public spaces which are conducive to
community interaction, including innovative parking arrangements, combinations
of permitted uses, and rehabilitation of existing structures.
R-1A Single Family Residential District This District provides areas for
single-family dwellings at a density of 14.52 units per acre. Lots are
characterized by traditional-style widths of thirty feet and shallow side and
rear yard setbacks.
R-1B Single Family Residential District  This District provides areas for
single-family dwellings at a density of 7.26 units per acre. Lots are
characterized by widths of sixty feet and moderate side and rear yard setbacks.
R-1C Single Family Residential District  This District provides areas for
single-family dwellings at a density of 4.84 units per acre. Lots are
characterized by widths of sixty feet, large side yard setbacks and moderate
rear yard setbacks.
R-2 Residential District This District provides areas for single-family and
two-family dwellings. Conventional lots are allowed a density of 3.63 units per
acre and are characterized by widths of 80 feet, ample side yard setbacks, and
moderate rear yard setbacks. Zero-lot line lots are allowed a density of 7.26
units per acre and are characterized by widths of 40 feet, ample side yard
setbacks, and moderate rear yard setbacks. The minimum dwelling area required
in this district is reduced for units containing less than three bedrooms.
R-3 Residential District This District provides areas for multi-family
dwellings and also conditionally permits nursing homes and congregate housing.
Lots are allowed a density of 8 units per acre and are characterized by ample
total setbacks and moderate rear yard setbacks.
MHP Manufactured Home Park District The MHP Manufactured Home Park District is
hereby created to provide for the suitable location for manufactured home
parks.
PUD Planned Unit Development District
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is to achieve, to
the greatest possible degree, land development that encourages imaginative
design of development and is responsive to the physical assets and liabilities
of a given site. The PUD should be a well integrated development in terms of
major design elements such as roads, drainage systems, utilities, and open
space. The PUD allows greater design flexibility so that natural features may
be protected and development can be planned in an innovative and efficient
manner.
   C-1 Neighborhood Commercial District
Uses in this District are to provide goods and services to an immediate
residential neighborhood.  Goods and services are to be oriented to daily or
weekly needs and are not to include activities characterized by major purchase
items or goods or services which are oriented to a City-wide or highway-
attracted clientele.
   C-2 Business Office District
This District is designed to allow general commercial office activities in
areas of high accessibility and serving the general public; as well as certain
semi-public uses which have been deemed compatible therewith.
   C-3 Core Business District
The purpose of this District is to lawfully characterize and protect downtown
Rossford from inappropriate development that would harm the character and
history of the district. There will be only one C-3 District. The uses
permitted hereunder have been designed with the primary intention of
legitimizing existing uses so that their continued operation and compatibility
might be preserved.
   C-4 Interstate and General Commercial District
Uses in this District are to provide areas for services required primarily by
the transient motoring public. This District will be closely associated with
major interchange areas along limited access highways and major thoroughfares
in the City.
   PC Planned Commercial District
The Planned Commercial District (PC) is developed to apply to the “Crossroads
of America” area and other premier development sites in the City of Rossford.
This District is created to achieve, to the greatest possible degree, land
development that is responsive to the natural and environmental assets of a
site, and to encourage imaginative and innovative site planning and arrangement
of compatible commercial and related land uses. Development in this District
will provide for the convergence of commercial and office uses developed in a
park-like setting with excellent architectural design.
   M-1 Light Industry District
This District permits manufacture, assembly, storage or transfer activities
whose nature of operation produces a minimum of noise, odor, dust, and smoke.
The district is also associated with little outside storage or assembly, and
typically is of low density usage.
   M-2 Heavy Industry District
This District permits general heavy manufacturing and assembly activities.
   PI Planned Industrial District
The PI Planned Industrial District is developed to apply to the “Crossroads of
America" area and other premier development sites in the City of Rossford. This
District is created to achieve, to the greatest possible degree, land
development that is responsive to the natural and environmental assets of a
site, and to encourage imaginative and innovative site planning and arrangement
of compatible industrial and related land uses. Development in this District
will provide for the convergence of industrial, office and limited commercial
uses developed in a park-like setting with excellent architectural design.
   DRO Design Review Overlay District
The purposes for the Design Review Overlay District Ordinance are to establish
procedures whereby sites in the Design Review Overlay District are afforded
protection from actions that would be detrimental to preserving established
historic and cultural resources in the community, impair the successful
functioning of the community, create appearance-related nuisances or constitute
a blighting influence on nearby property, and to pursue the following
objectives:
   (a)    Establish a Design Review Commission to review, regulate, and
encourage designs of buildings, structures, and spaces in relationship to
specified areas of the community;
   (b)    Identify historic, architectural, and cultural resources through a
building inventory using Ohio Historic Inventory Forms provided by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office and adoption of these by Council as Locally
Significant Resources;
   (c)    Encourage the development, alteration, improvement, and maintenance
of the distinctive character and architectural design of Locally Significant
Resources in the District in accordance with adopted design criteria;
   (d)    Safeguard the architectural integrity and to foster and encourage
preservation or adaptive use of vacant or underutilized Locally Significant
Resources and other architectural features in the District;
   (e)    Seek alternatives to demolition or incompatible alterations within
the District before such acts are performed;
   (f)    Ensure the architectural compatibility of construction of new in-fill
structures within the District
   (g)    Contribute to the economic, cultural, and educational development by:
      (1)    Protecting and enhancing the safety and comfort of the City of
Rossford’s attractions to existing and prospective residents, businesses, and
tourists;
      (2)    Making the City of Rossford a more attractive and desirable place
in which to live and work;
      (3)    Providing support and stimulus to business and industry;
      (4)    Strengthening the economy of the City of Rossford by creating new
job opportunity and stabilizing, maintaining, and improving real estate values;
      (5)    Facilitating reinvestment in and revitalization of the Design
Review Overlay District. 
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1131.02  ZONING MAP; INTERPRETATION OF BOUNDARIES.
   (a)    The Districts and their boundary lines are indicated and hereby
established upon the Official Zoning Map, City of Rossford, which is on file
with the Clerk of Council and dated and is hereby made a part of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)    All questions concerning the exact location of zoning district
boundaries shall be resolved by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with
Chapter
1103 (Board of Zoning Appeals). 
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
CHAPTER 1132
Permitted and Special Land Uses
1132.01   Use designations in the Land Use Matrix.
1132.02   Matrix of permitted and special land uses.
1132.01  USE DESIGNATIONS IN THE LAND USE MATRIX.
   This Chapter provides a list of permitted and special land uses in the form
of a Land Use Matrix.
   (a)    Zoning Districts. Each of the Zoning Districts established in Section
1131.01 (Purpose; Establishment) are indicated over each of the columns in the
Land Use Matrix.
   (b)    Interpretation of Land Uses. The permitted and special land uses
allowed in the City of Rossford are indicated as rows in the matrix. Each land
use listed in the matrix has been assigned to one of the following land use
categories: agricultural uses, residential uses, government and institutional
uses, commercial uses, and industrial uses. Permitted and special accessory
uses are also listed at the end of the Land Use Matrix.
      (1)    The presumption established by this Chapter is that all principal
uses of land allowed in the City of Rossford are listed in the Land Use Matrix
and assigned to at least one zoning district.
      (2)    Uses which are omitted from any Zoning District shall be
considered prohibited until such uses are amended into these regulations
pursuant to Chapter
1114 (Amendment Procedures).
      (3)    Since the list of land uses set forth in the Land Use Matrix
cannot be all- inclusive, the Zoning Inspector shall refer proposed
questionable uses to the Planning Commission for determination whether or not a
proposed use is of a similar nature, is similar in character, or will have
similar impacts to a specified permitted or special land use listed in the Land
Use Matrix.
      (4)    The Land Use Matrix shall not be interpreted to allow a principal
use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to
another specified principal use that is listed in another zoning district.
      (5)    Whenever a mixed-use development could fall within more than one
use classification in the Land Use Matrix, the classification that most closely
and most specifically describes the development shall control. W hen a mixed
use development comprises two or more principal uses where any of the principal
uses is a special use, then the entire mixed-use development shall be deemed a
special use.
   (c)    Symbols for Permitted and Conditional Land Uses. When used in
connection with a particular use listed in the Land Use Matrix:
      (1)    The letter “P” means that the use is permitted in the indicated
zoning district with a Zoning Permit issued by the Zoning Inspector.
      (2)    The letter “S” means a Special Use Certificate must be obtained
from the Planning Commission in accordance with Chapter
1112 (Special Use Permits) and Chapter
1134 (Supplemental Land Use Regulations) before a Zoning Permit may be issued
by the Zoning Inspector.
      (3)    The lack of any symbol means the proposed land use is prohibited
in the Zoning District.  (Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)

1133.01  GENERAL YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   In addition to all yard regulations specified in other Sections of this
Ordinance, the following shall apply to all districts.
   (a)    Architectural Projections: Open structures such as fireplace chases,
porches, canopies, balconies, platforms; carports, covered patios, and similar
architectural projections shall be considered parts of the building to which
they are attached and shall not project into the required minimum front, side,
or rear yards.
   (b)    Setback Requirements for Corner Buildings: For any corner lot in any
district, all yards with lot lines adjoining all street right-of-way lines
shall conform to the requirements for the front yard setbacks in the district
in which such lot is zoned. Additionally, for those yards that adjoin the side
yards of a neighboring lot, a side yard setback shall be required.
   (c)    Yard Requirements for Multi-family or Group Dwellings: Group or
multi-family dwellings shall be considered as one building for the purpose of
determining front, side, and rear yard requirements.  The entire group as a
unit shall require one front, one rear, and two side yards as specified for
dwellings in the appropriate district.
   (d)    Visibility at Intersections. On a corner lot in any district, nothing
shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to
materially impede vision between a height of two and a half (2-1/2) feet and
ten (10) feet above the center line grades of the intersecting streets in the
area bounded by the right-of-way of such corner lots and a line joining points
along the right-of-way twenty-five (25) feet from the point of intersection.
   (e)    Yard Requirements for Buffering Purposes: To secure a desirable
transition between land zoned for residential purposes and other zoning
districts C-1 through M-2, except PC, PI, and PUD, it is required that greater
yard setbacks be provided on the property that is not zoned for residential
purposes along the lot line(s) that abut land zoned for residential purposes.
When property that is zoned C-1 through M-2 abuts property that is zoned to
permit single-, two-, or multiple-family residential dwellings, the yard
requirements for that yard adjacent to the residentially zoned property, shall
be increased two (2) times over the normally required yard setback (including
any overlay district requirements), up to a maximum of seventy-five (75) feet,
and a landscaped buffer yard shall be provided in this area in accordance with
Chapter
1138 (Landscaping Regulations) with special exception to additional
requirements of corner lots discussed in Section
1133.01(b) (Setback Requirements for Corner Buildings).
   (f)    Exceptions to Height Regulations: The height limitations contained in
this Zoning Ordinance do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas,
water tanks, ventilators, chimneys, or other appurtenances usually required to
be placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy, except
where the height of such structures will constitute a hazard to the safe
landing and take-off of aircraft at an established airport.

   c.   The minimum side yard on each side of any building shall not be less
than ten (10) percent of the lot width; however, the total side yard
requirement may not be less than the standard indicated.  In a zero lot-line
dwelling, one (1) side yard shall not be less than ten (10) percent of the lot
width.
   d.   In any case where the side or rear yard abuts an R-1 District, such
side or rear yard will be increased an additional foot for every foot that any
building exceeds twenty (20) feet in height.
   e.   Site plans shall be submitted in accordance with Chapter
1111 (Site Plan Review Procedures).
   f.   Within all areas zoned P, PC and PI, buffer zones shall be constructed
along all side and/or rear lot lines, in accordance with Section
1138.08 (Buffer Strip Requirements for P, PC and PI Districts).
   g.   Structures may exceed the specified height standard provided that:
      (1)   All required yards shall be increased by one (1) foot for each one
(1) foot of building height more than the specified height standard.
      (2)   No site plan shall be approved which includes buildings more than
fifty (50) feet in height unless approved by the Fire Chief.
      (3)   In the PC and PI Districts, the site shall have a maximum building
floor area/lot area ratio of two to one (2:1) meaning that the total usable
floor space within all structures will not exceed twice the total lot area.
   h.   Percentage of impervious surface shall be calculated by dividing the
surface area of existing and proposed impervious surfaces of a lot or parcel by
the total surface area of the lot or parcel.  (Ord. 2013-39.  Passed 9-23-13.)
1133.03  DRIVEWAYS AND LOT RESTRICTIONS.
       (a)       "Driveway" is hereby defined as a permanent hard surfaced way
that provides access to a garage, carport, unsheltered parking space, or
parking lot from a street or place.  The area of a driveway is subject to the
impervious area coverage restrictions of Section
1133.02.
       (b)       All driveways shall be constructed of asphalt, concrete,
gravel, brick, or similar material.
       (c)       In any residential district within the City of Rossford, no
more than forty percent (40%) of the area bounded by the front setback line,
street line and side lines of a lot shall be devoted to coverage by a driveway,
subject to the impervious area coverage restrictions of Section
1133.02.
   (d)   The number and placement of a driveway is subject to access control
measures in accordance to Section
 1136.17.
(Ord. 2013-40.  Passed 9-23-13.)
1133.04   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES/ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   (a)     Accessory structures, buildings and uses are allowed in all zoning
districts and must remain within the impervious area coverage.  Prior to
construction or installation of any accessory structure a zoning permit as
provided by Section
1102.02 is required.
   (b)     For residential districts or residential structures in other
districts:
      (1)     Where an accessory structure is structurally attached to a main
building it shall be subject to, and must conform to all regulations of this
Ordinance applicable to the main building.
      (2)    An accessory structure including but not limited to a tool shed,
storage building, detached garage, tree house or gazebo shall not be located in
the front yard of any lot and if located in a side yard may not be located any
closer to the front lot line than the existing front setback of the principal
structure.  On a corner lot, the accessory structure must be located no closer
than the setback of the existing principal structure or the required front yard
setback on the side street side. 
      (3)    No accessory structure shall be constructed on any lot prior to
the time of construction of the principal building to which it is accessory,
except on an abutting lot to a residential lot under the same ownership
containing the principal building. 
      (4)    All driveways and detached garages must be designed to conform to
the existing adjoining grade.  If the petitioner can demonstrate to the
reasonable satisfaction of the City, that it is not feasible to have the
foundation and driveway to conform to grade, appropriate screening can be a
retaining wall with a finished exterior, a solid screen using landscaping or a
fence or some other decorative treatment, which sufficiently reduces the visual
impact of the foundation and driveway. 
      (5)    Accessory structures shall also not be located closer than five
(5) feet from any property line, or a distance equal to one-half (1/2) of the
height of the accessory structure if it exceeds one (1) story or sixteen (16)
feet measured to the peak of the building, whichever is greater.  In areas
where the principal building setbacks do not comform to current code, the
accessory structure/building can be set to the set back of the principal
building.
      (6)    No accessory structure or portion shall exceed a height of 
sixteen (16) feet above grade; except that no tree house may be taller than the
highest point of the primary structure.  Accessory structures may exceed the
height of sixteen (16) feet upon application and approval of a special use
permit as provided and in accordance with Chapter
1112.
      (7)    The square footage of all accessory structures shall not exceed 75
percent of the first or ground floor of the principal structure except upon
application and approval of a special use permit as provided and in accordance
with Chapter
1112.
      (8)    Accessory structures connected by open breezeways are considered
separate structures. 
      (9)    Handicap ramps or other devices required to make reasonable
accommodation for residential purposes under the Fair Housing Act or the
American with Disabilities Act are to be permited in the required front, side
or rear yard setbacks provided that the maximum encroachment into a required
setback is the minimum dimension required by the applicable building code for
accessible ramps and that no other location is feasible outside the required
setbacks. 
   (c)     For Non-Residential Districts:
      (1)    Accessory structures shall meet all setback requirements and must
remain within the impervious area coverage for the zoning district they are
located in.  On a corner lot, the accessory structure must be located no closer
than the setback of the existing principal structure or the required front yard
setback on the side street side.
      (2)    Structures connected by an open breezeway are considered separate
structures.
      (3)    An accessory structure may not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in
height.  Accessory structures may exceed the height of twenty-five (25) feet
upon application and approval of a special use permit as provided and in
accordance with Chapter
1112.
         (Ord. 2013-41.  Passed 9-23-13.)
1133.05   IMPERVIOUS SURFACES.
   (a)     "Impervious Surface" means an area that releases as runoff all or a
majority of the precipitation that falls on it.  "Impervious surface" excludes
frozen soil but includes rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, and
streets unless specifically designed, constructed, and maintained to be
pervious.
   (b)     For existing impervious surfaces that were lawfully placed when
constructed but that do not comply with the impervious surface standard in
section
1133.02, the property owner may do any of the following:
      (1)    Maintain and repair the existing impervious surfaces;
      (2)    Replace existing impervious surfaces with similar surfaces that
meet applicable setbacks;
      (3)    Relocate or modify an existing impervious surface with similar or
different impervious surface, provided that the relocation or modification does
not result in an increase in the percentage of impervious surface that existed
on the effective date of this ordinance.
   (c)   Prior to construction or installation of any impervious surface a
zoning permit as provided by Section
 1102.02 is required.

1134.01  CHILD CARE OR DAY CARE FACILITIES.
   A petitioner for a zoning permit for a child care or day care facility shall
be required to prove that he or she has complied with all applicable state laws
and copies of the state permits shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector. The
zoning permit will expire on a yearly basis. The zoning permit shall be renewed
by the Zoning Inspector with proof that the petitioner has complied with all
applicable state laws governing child care facilities.
   (a)    Child care or day care facilities with an average daily attendance of
less than six (6) children are allowed by right in any residential districts
according to state laws.
   (b)    Child care or day care facilities with more than seven (7) children
and less than twelve (12) in average daily attendance may be allowed in any

      (Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1134.02  DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT STANDARDS.
   (a)    Design Standards Applicable to the Design Review Overlay District.
The primary standard which shall apply to applications for a Certificate of
Appropriateness for sites within the Design Review Overlay District shall be
whether the application under consideration promotes, preserves, and enhances
the architectural character of the community. Deliberation may also take into
account the following factors:
      (1)    The historic, cultural, architectural or archeological value and
significance of the property;
      (2)    The relationship of any architectural features of a structure to
the rest of the structure and the surrounding area;
      (3)    The general compatibility of the design, arrangement, texture and
material proposed to be used;
      (4)    Other factors, such as aesthetic value and cost, that the
Commission finds relevant.
   (b)    Locally Significant Resources. In the event the application involves
property containing a designated Locally Significant Resource, the Design
Review Commission shall use as evaluative criteria the ten federal standards
established by the Department of the Interior in “The Secretary of Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation & Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings” by Morton, Hume, Weeks and Jandl (United States, National
Park Service, Preservation Assistance Division, 1991, as reprinted in 1997).
Such standards are incorporated as a part of this Chapter as if fully rewritten
herein. A copy of the complete Standards are available in the City offices or
may be purchased from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Superintendent of
Documents, Mail Stop: SSOP, Washington, D.C. 20402-9328.  Wherever possible,
the historic character of a Locally Significant Resource should be retained,
preserved, renovated, and where appropriate, adaptively reused. Specifically:
      (1)    A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in
a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site environment.  Distinctive features, finishes, and
construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a
historic property shall be preserved. Most properties change over time; those
changes that have acquired Locally Significant Resource status in their own
right shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided.
      (2)    Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historic development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      (3)    Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. If major facade components are badly deteriorating or missing (and
replicas are not feasible) great care should be taken to replace them with
creative designs that reflect the proportions, scale, detail, design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials of the
original.
      (4)    New additional, exterior alterations or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be comparable with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment. New construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
      (5)    Original building facade wall surfaces and detailing should be
restored whenever possible.
      (6)    Special attention should be given to the removal of storefront
applied surface materials that have original building details preserved
beneath, especially those surface materials that extend onto the piers and
walls of the upper facade.
      (7)    All exposed mechanical equipment, unused electrical apparatus or
sign supports should be removed.
      (8)    Cornice or Fascia. W here removed, a cornice or fascia should be
restored to reemphasize the original design intent of the structure and should
be designed in proportion to the overall mass of the building.
      (9)    Brick. Maintain the colors, textures, and bonding patterns of
brick found in existing historic structures.
      (10)    Color. Utilize color schemes relevant to the historic period
represented by the building architecture during remodeling or new construction,
limiting strong accent colors for special effects only.
      (11)    Entrances. On traditional storefront buildings, recessed
entrances are encouraged. Maintain established materials and design of entrance
door hardware.
      (12)    Windows. Maintain the design, scale, proportion of window modules
and sustain the repetitive rhythm of window patterns along established block
facades.
         A.   Display windows of a storefront should never be filled or covered
except where there are residential uses abutting the sidewalk on the ground
floor.
         B.   Preserve the original proportions of window openings during
interior alterations.
         C.   Maintain the original arrangement of glass panes whenever
possible or duplicate similar configurations found along the square.
         D.   Retain or duplicate the original materials of window elements
such as sashes, frames, sills, jambs, and lintels.
         E.   Maintain widths of single and double module windows that reflect
the architectural lines of the upper part of the facade.
      (13)    Awnings. Awnings should be attached directly to the building
without requiring a support column on the sidewalk and have a minimum clearance
of eight (8) feet and a maximum clearance of twelve (12) feet above the
sidewalk. Awning signs shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the
vertical area of the sign.
      (14)    Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
   (c)   Properties Not Designated as Locally Significant Resources. For
property which does not contain a designated Locally Significant Resource, the
Design Review Commission shall determine appropriateness by whether the
proposed activity will have a negative effect on the historic character and
visual integrity of the Design Review Overlay District.
      (1)    Building architecture, materials, colors, and height should be
designed to complement and coordinate with Locally Significant Resources in the
Design Review Overlay District.
      (2)    If new materials are to be used for buildings that are
architecturally undistinguished, they should be selected to coordinate with
neighboring structures and to complement the design of the structure.
   
   (d)    New Construction. The Design Review Commission shall determine
appropriateness of a completely new freestanding structure by whether the new
construction will have a negative effect on the historic character and visual
integrity of the Design Review Overlay District. New construction shall be
designed to:
      (1)    Maintain the repetitive storefront widths along established block
facades to create a unified street wall.
      (2)    On traditional storefront buildings, recessed entrances are
encouraged.
      (3)    Building architecture, materials, colors, and height should be
designed to complement and coordinate with Locally Significant Resources in the
Design Review Overlay District.
   (e)    Demolition Applications.
      (1)    Upon a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition, the Design Review Commission shall determine whether the structure
is or has the potential for designation as a Locally Significant Resource.
         A.   If not a Locally Significant Resource or a potential Locally
Significant Resource, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the
demolition of such structure, whether public or private.
         B.   If the subject structure is determined to have the potential for
designation as a Locally Significant Resource, every effort shall be expended
by the Design Review Commission to undertake meaningful discussion with the
applicant to find a means of preserving the resource, including a continuance
of the hearing for up to ninety (90) days to permit the Commission recommend to
Council that the designation of "Locally Significant Resource" be assigned to
such building, identify alternative uses for the structure, undertake grant
applications, or seek public acquisition or purchase by a third party with a
preservation interest in the building.
         C.   No Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued for demolition of
a Locally Significant Resource unless the Design Review Commission finds there
is no reasonable economic use or return for the structure as it exists such
that deterioration has progressed to the extent that rehabilitation is not
economically sound, or there is no feasible and prudent alternative to
demolition. To justify that rehabilitation is not economically sound, the
record must contain sufficient information so that the Commission may
adequately make a factual decision. Evidence which may be found significant in
such a determination may include: a two-year gross income statement from the
property which itemizes operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation, debt-
service, and annual cash flow; a two- year financial pro-forma prepared by a
third party architect, developer, appraiser, or other real estate professional
experienced in rehabilitation; a two-year history of offers substantiated by a
real estate broker engaged to advertise to sell or lease the property at a
reasonable price or rent; an evaluation of structural suitability for
rehabilitation signed by a licensed engineer or architect experienced in
rehabilitation; economic incentives and/or funding available to the applicant
through federal, state, City, or private programs; the history of real estate
taxes over the past two years, the purchase price, and the relationship between
the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the property was
purchased; and similar reliable and probative evidence and testimony.
      (2)    Where a Certificate of Appropriateness is approved for demolition,
every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve Locally
Significant Resources adjacent to or affected by any project.
         A.   Prior to demolition, the owner shall provide up to a six-month
window of opportunity for all historic features to be salvaged from the
property.
         B.   Once the structure has been removed, the lot shall be graded to
the level of the sidewalk and sloped to provide proper site drainage to assure
that water does not compromise adjacent building or foundation walls, nor allow
surface run-off to flow on any sidewalk or right-of-way.
         C.   Landscaping treatments, such as plants, trees, fencing, walkways,
benches, and other elements shall be installed to preserve or create a unified
street wall, or park-like space.
   (f)   Minimum Maintenance Requirements. Properties in the Design Review
Overlay District shall be kept in good repair in a safe and sanitary condition
and presentable appearance. Such properties shall be provided sufficient
maintenance and upkeep for such structure to ensure its perpetuation and to
prevent its destruction by deterioration.
   (g)    Guidelines for Developing Additional Design Standards. After
appointment and subject to Council approval, the Design Review Commission may
develop and provide City Council with specific design standards and guidelines
for each subdistrict within the established Design Review Overlay District.
      (1)    Additional design standards and guidelines developed for
subdistricts within the Design Review Overlay District shall be based upon the
following:
         A.   Historic Areas.  Design review standards that address historical
areas shall conform to “The Secretary of Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation & Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings”
by Morton, Hume, Weeks and Jandl (United States, National Park Service,
Preservation Assistance Division, 1991, as reprinted in 1997).
         B.   New Construction. Design review standards and guidelines shall
not limit new construction to any one historical period or architectural style,
but shall seek to insure compatibility with relevant historical or contextual
urban design considerations of a neighborhood, district or corridor.
         C.   Relation to Underlying Zoning District. The use, lot area, and
bulk regulations in a particular Design Review Overlay District shall be in
accordance with the applicable underlying zoning district, except as the use,
area, and yard regulations may be expressly modified or revised in accordance
with this chapter.
         D.   Relation to the Comprehensive Plan. Design review standards
should address any design standards adopted in the Rossford Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)    Additional design standards shall address preferred methods for
modification and reuse of structures and methods to encourage compatible new
development within the Design Review Overlay District. Such standards shall
include sufficient detail and may address:
         A.   Design;
         B.   Building height;
         C.   Building width;
         D.   Roof type;
         E.   Building materials consisting of the type characteristic of the
century or period;
         F.   Ornamentation of features such as window and door lintels,
quoins, soffits, cornices, fences, railing and the like;
         G.   Walkway paving materials;
         H.   Building setback from the street line;
         I.   Color or colors of the exterior as related to color or colors of
surrounding structures;
         J.   Arrangements of the structures on the lot;
         K.   Scale, placement and design of signage;
         L.   Exterior lighting;
         M.   Exterior landscape elements.

dwelling units unless:
   (a)    The yard dimensions still meet the yard dimensions required by the
zoning regulations for new structures in that district.
   (b)    The lot area per dwelling equals the lot area requirements for new
structures in that district.
   (c)    The floor area per dwelling unit is not reduced to less than that
which is required for new construction in that district.
   (d)    The conversion is otherwise in compliance with this Ordinance (e.g.,
property is zoned for double or multi-family use) and all other relevant
ordinances and ordinances.

1134.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The Zoning Inspector or Board of Zoning Appeals prior to the issuance of a

(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1134.11  PUD - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS.
   A PUD - Planned Unit Development District may be applied to any property in
the City of Rossford upon the approval of the Preliminary and Final Development
Plans by the Planning Commission and City Council pursuant to Chapter
1113 (PUD District Review Procedures).  Subsequent to such approval, the
Official Zoning Map shall be amended to designate the property “PUD”. 
Following approval of a Final Development Plan and Development Standards Text,
all future development in the approved PUD shall be in conformance with the
plan and the construction of site improvements must be commenced within two (2)
years of Council approval.  The following standards represent broad parameters
under which all PUD developments must be designed:
   (a)   Minimum PUD Size.  The tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD
must be owned, leased, or controlled by one person or single entity and must be
at least five (5) contiguous acres in size.
   (b)   Development Layout and Design.  The design and layout of all PUD’s
shall display excellence in design by properly considering: significant natural
and historic features, topography, natural drainage patterns, roadway access,
and circulation, pedestrian circulation, surrounding land uses, and the
enhancement of the general welfare of the public, in an aesthetically desirable
land development.  Attractive landscaped buffers shall be provided between
incompatible land use and activities.
   (c)   Central Water and Sewer Facilities.  All structures in developments
approved as a PUD must be served by central water and sewer facilities.
   (d)   General Development Standards for Perimeter Lots.  All lots located
along the perimeter of a PUD shall create a desirable transition to adjoining
property in terms of both land use and building setbacks.
   (e)   Required Open Space.  The PUD plan shall provide for open space that
can be utilized for passive and active recreational acres.  Where a development
is proposed to be primarily residential uses with less than ten (10) percent of
the project area set aside for business uses, a minimum of fifteen percent
(15%) of the project shall be reserved as open space.
      (1)   All active and passive recreational areas including, but not
limited to, community buildings (up to 10,000 sq. ft.), swimming pools, ball
fields, tennis courts, bike trails, walking trails, landscape buffers, natural
open space and water features shall be considered open space.
      (2)   Areas that shall not be counted as required open space include:
         A.   Private roads and public road rights of way;
         B.   Parking areas, accessways, and driveways;
         C.   An area of fifteen (15) feet between structures or parking areas
and restricted open space;

care.  The legal articles relating to any organization of property owners in
the development charged with such open space maintenance is subject to review
and approval by the City Council.  City Council may require, as a condition of
final approval, any evidence deemed necessary to document that the required
common space will remain in its stated condition forever and not be subject to
further subdivision (including such legal documents as deed restrictions,
conservation easements, etc.)
   (f)   Clustering Residential Development.  Clustering residential density is
encouraged to provide required common open space.  To achieve a clustering of
residential density and to provide for the required common open space, the lot
area requirements for residential land uses may be reduced from the densities
required under the most applicable conventional zoning district(s) to that
approved in the PUD plan.  The lot width and yard requirements may also be
reduced as approved in the PUD plan to accommodate a variety of structural
patterns, clustering designs and housing types.  (Ord. 2008-34.  Passed 9-22-
08.)
1134.12  SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   Sexually-oriented business uses have additional regulations imposed to
protect children from accidental or other exposure to sexually-oriented
materials and activities and because of the likelihood to produce harmful
secondary health, safety, and aesthetic effects on residential neighborhoods
and other specified land uses. These regulations are not adopted for the
purpose of restricting or prohibiting any protected speech associated with
sexually-oriented business land uses. The Supreme Court and lower federal
courts have recognized a number of possible secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses, including: decline of character of a community’s
neighborhoods and quality of life; increase of crime (e.g., prostitution, drug
sales); spread of disease, particularly sexually transmitted diseases;
degeneration of the social and moral order; and harm to children.
   Given the documented harmful secondary effects of sexually-oriented
businesses on adjacent neighborhoods and specific land uses, the following
specific, reasonable and uniform regulations have been developed to protect the
public health and safety of the residents of the municipality.
   (a)    Permitted and Prohibited Land Uses.

         D.   Sexually-oriented motel;
         E.   Sexually-oriented theater;
      (2)    Prohibited Land Uses. Sexually-oriented businesses prohibited in
the City include the following land uses as defined in Title Seven
(Definitions) and any other sexually-oriented businesses not addressed in this
Zoning Ordinance:
         A.   Sexually-oriented escort agency;
         B.   Sexually-oriented studio;
         C.   Sexually-oriented encounter center;
         D.   Sexually-oriented spa.
   (b)   Accessory Uses.
      (1)    A sexually-oriented business use may not be an accessory use.
      (2)    No two sexually-oriented business uses separately-defined herein

   (c)    Separation Requirements. For the purpose of this Section, measurement
shall be made in a straight line, without regard to the intervening structures
or objects, from the nearest portion of the structure used as the part of the
premises where a sexually-oriented business is conducted, to the nearest
property line of the premises of a use listed above in this section. Presence
of a municipal, county, or other political subdivision boundary shall be
irrelevant for purposes of calculating and applying the distance requirements
of this Section.

which depict or describe specified sexual activities or specified anatomical
areas shall be shown, distributed or exhibited so as to be visible to the
public from any other privately owned property, pedestrian sidewalks or
walkways, or from other public or semi- public areas.
   (e)    Public View to Be Prevented. All building openings, entries, windows,
and doors of sexually oriented businesses shall be located, covered, or
serviced in such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior from any other

while watching sexually-oriented type of material or performances shall be
restricted to use by one person at all times, shall be open to public view at
all times from the interior of the building, and shall be configured in such a
manner that there is an unobstructed view of the viewing room from a manager’s
station.
      (7)    Restrooms. Separate male and female restrooms shall be provided
for and used by sexually-oriented business establishment employees and patrons.
All restrooms in a sexually-oriented business establishment shall be equipped
with standard toilets, sinks, and other traditional lavatory facilities.
Restrooms shall not contain video reproduction equipment. No sexually-oriented

restrooms of a sexually-oriented business establishment.
      (8)    Non-Public Interior Areas. Areas where patrons will not be

      (1)    A sign shall be clearly posted on the railing that no person may
extend any part of his or her body over or beyond the barrier or railing.
      (2)    Any such tips or gratuities must be placed into a receptacle
provided by management for receipt of such tips and gratuities or shall be
placed on or near the stage on which the employee or other person is

to the sexually oriented business stating:
         A.   An employee may not touch the breast, buttocks, or genitals of a
patron, nor may a patron touch the breast, buttocks, or genitals of an
employee; and
         B.   A patron may not place any money on the person or in or on the
costume of an employee.
   (j)    Obscene or Criminal Activity Prohibited.  No sexually-oriented
business shall allow media, matter, visual representations, live performances,

1134.17  WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   In the interest of general safety and welfare of the public, all wireless
telecommunication facilities are subject to the following conditions:
   (a)    Telecommunication facilities shall not be permitted within three
hundred (300) feet of any residentially zoned area.
   (b)    Telecommunications towers shall not exceed two hundred (200) feet in
height. The telecommunication tower design must withstand at least one hundred
(100) mile an hour winds.  Towers shall have no handholds or footholds closer
to finished grade than forty (40) feet.
   (c)    No equipment shelter shall exceed three hundred (300) square feet.
Combined square feet of all shelters shall not exceed six hundred (600) square
feet. Equipment shelters shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height.
Underground equipment shelters or support facilities are encouraged and may be
required by the Planning Commission.
   (d)    If the telecommunications facility is built as an accessory use of a
site, the facility shall not be located between the principal building and any
public right-of-way.
   (e)    All Telecommunication facilities including a telecommunication tower,
any guy wires, and any structures shall be surrounded by a fence at least six
(6) feet in height, and the fence shall be locked to prohibit unauthorized
access. An evergreen screen shall be planted around the fence, with exception
to the entrance, that will achieve a height of at least five (5) feet, and
shall be maintained by the applicant or his or her representatives.
   (f)    All towers and fencing shall be painted to blend in with its
environment and minimize its visibility unless prohibited by FCC or FAA.
   (g)    No signals, lights or other illumination shall be permitted, unless
required by FAA regulation, other federal or state law, or otherwise
authorized. Lighting of accessory structures for security purposes is
permissible but shall be so arranged so as to direct and reflect light away
from any adjacent residential property or public way. W hen lighting of a tower
is required, it shall be placed on the tower and designed in such a way as to
minimize glare on adjacent residential properties.
   (h)    No commercial advertising shall be allowed on a tower or antenna,
except for antennas attached to an existing and approved sign. Towers may have
safety or warning signs in appropriate places.  No trespassing or similar
warning signs shall be posted around the facility with an emergency telephone
number indicating the person(s) or authority to contact in the event of an
emergency.
   (i)    All utility service to a facility shall be provided underground.
   (j)    Facilities shall be fully automated and unattended on a daily basis
and shall be visited only for periodic and necessary maintenance or emergency
situations after construction.
   (k)    The applicant must agree to permit other wireless telecommunications
service providers to collocate onto the proposed facility, unless mechanical,
structural, or regulatory factors prevent such collocation on reasonable
economic terms consistent with the actual capital and operating expenses of the
facility, and with the construction on ongoing operation of the tower. The
application shall provide documentation on this subject on request of the City
of Rossford.
   (l)    Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a wireless
telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site, unless
repairs to the facility are being made.
   (m)    All abandoned or unused wireless telecommunication facilities shall
be removed by the operator within six (6) months of the continuous cessation of
use unless ownership and use thereof has been transferred to another person.
   (n)    When a proposed wireless telecommunications facility is to include a
new tower, the applicant shall submit a site plan to the Planning Commission
and include the following information in addition to such information required
in Chapter
1111 (Site Plan Review Procedures):
      (1)    Provide a map Indicating the location of all structures and
buildings and their use within three hundred (300) feet of the planned wireless
telecommunications facility.
      (2)    Provide a landscape plan showing how the wireless
telecommunications facility will be screened from adjoining uses.
      (3)    Provide evidence of written contact with all wireless service
providers who supply service within two thousand (2,000) feet of the proposed
facility. The applicant shall inquire about potential collocation opportunities
at all technically feasible locations. The applicant’s letters to providers, as
well as responses, shall be required as a means of demonstrating the need for a
new tower and to establish proof that a newly constructed tower is necessary
since collocation of an existing tower is not feasible.
      (4)    Provide a statement of need by the applicant, clearly
demonstrating why the proposed facility must be located where it is proposed
and why other nearby structures cannot be used to support the proposed antenna
and why a tower and the proposed site is technically necessary.
      (5)    Provide evidence of legal access to the tower site thereby
maintaining this access regardless of other development that may take place on
the site.
      (6)    Demonstrate that the design of the tower complies with all FCC and
FAA regulations concerning radio frequency, electromagnetic emission standards,
and safety.
      (7)    Provide elevation plans showing the proposed telecommunications
facility and the specifications for the antenna and support structure shall be
submitted. The applicant must also submit information concerning the
telecommunication tower’s maximum capacity in terms of antenna.
      (8)    Submit a statement of compliance confirming that the proposed
facility complies will all federal and state laws and regulations concerning
aviation safety.
      (9)    Submit a maintenance plan of how the facility will be maintained
in the future and by whom.
      (10)   Any other information deemed necessary by the Zoning Inspector.
   (o)    Satellite Dishes.
      (1)    Purpose. Supplemental regulations governing telecommunication
facilities are established for the construction, erection, maintenance,
extension and removal of telecommunication facilities in specified zoning
districts and to balance the competing interests created by the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104) and the interests of the
City in regulating satellite dishes and related facilities for the following
reasons:
         A.   To provide for and protect the health, safety and general welfare
of residents and visitors.
         B.   To provide for orderly development;
         C.   To protect property values;
         D.   To reduce the visual impact of antennas in a municipality
containing both old and new homes, many with historic and architecturally
significant features;
         E.   To maintain unique residential character, unobstructed open
spaces, and attractive commercial and office/industrial areas;
         F.   To protect residential properties, parks, open spaces and the
commercial zoning districts from the intense and adverse effects of towers and
related facilities;
         G.   To promote collocation of telecommunications facilities in order
to decrease the total number of towers;
         H.   To reduce potential contact and conflicts between antennas and
utility lines, both above and below grade level;
         I.   To minimize obstructions to visibility around streets, sidewalks
and driveways;
         J.   To reduce impediments to moving people and equipment near
buildings and to avoid interference with firefighting and emergency ingress and
egress, both at and above grade level;
         K.   To reduce potential attractive nuisance to children, animals,
etc.;
         L.   To reduce the exposure of the antenna to high wind forces,
particularly from tornadoes, and reduce hazards from falling and wind-propelled
objects;
         M.   To limit interference with natural sunlight and the circulation
of air and to preserve space for trees and other plants.
      (2)    Applicability.
         A.   No person shall construct, erect, maintain, extend, or remove a
satellite dish without compliance with the provisions of this section.
         B.   Exempt Satellite Dishes. The following satellite dishes are
exempt from this Zoning Ordinance when located behind all front and side yard
setback lines unless such restriction precludes reception of an acceptable
quality signal:
            1.   Satellite dishes two (2) meters or less in diameter when
proposed as an accessory use in any commercial or industrial zoning district;
            2.   Satellite dishes one (1) meter or less in diameter when
proposed as an accessory use in any zoning district.
      (3)    Satellite dishes shall be an accessory structure in any district
subject to the following general restrictions:
         A.   The “dish” portion of a satellite dish over two (2) feet in
diameter shall have a surface of open mesh construction, and shall not have a
solid surface.
         B.   The satellite dish apparatus shall be painted to complement the
surrounding environment and be harmonious with neighboring property.
         C.   The satellite dish shall not be located in a side yard or between
the principal building and the right-of way unless such restriction precludes
reception of an acceptable quality signal.
         D.   A satellite dish shall be constructed and mounted in such manner
that it will withstand wind forces of up to seventy-five (75) miles an hour.
         E.   Ground-mounted satellite dishes shall be mounted upon a solid
concrete slab. Any guy wires attached to a satellite dish apparatus shall be
enclosed by an approved fence. The site of the apparatus shall be screened with
shrubbery and/or landscaped.
         F.   Only metal supports of galvanized construction shall be used.
         G.   Any driving motor shall be limited to one-hundred and ten (110)
volt maximum power and shall be encased in a protective guard.
         H.   All wiring between the apparatus and any other structure shall be
placed underground in approved conduit. The satellite dish apparatus shall be
bonded to an approved grounding rod.
      (4)    In residential districts, satellite dishes shall be subject to the
following additional limitations:
         A.   The use of the satellite dish is restricted to receiving signals
for television or radio communications for the use or enjoyment of those
occupying the main building.
         B.   The maximum diameter of any ground mounted satellite dish shall
not exceed six (6) feet in diameter. The maximum diameter of any building-

1134.18  WIND GENERATOR (TURBINE).
   (a)   Any turbine erected on a parcel of land will need to establish a
“clear fall zone” from all neighboring property lines and structures.  A
turbine will need to be erected and placed in such a manner that if it were to
fall, whatever direction the fall occurs would be contained solely on the
property where the turbine is located, and would not strike any off property
structures including the primary dwelling, and any accessory buildings or uses.
      (1)   Where “clear fall zones” are not located solely on the property
where the turbine is located a recordable easement shall be required.
   (b)   The turbine, including the prop blades, turbine, cowling, and tower
shall be painted or coated white, gray, or sky blue.  Logos or other
identification markers other than those of the manufacturer and model type
shall not be permitted anywhere on the turbine.

neighboring properties, total size, height, and decibel ratings of the unit.
      (2)   Evidence of a “clear fall zone” with the manufacturer’s
recommendation must be attached to the engineering report.
      (3)   If the “clear fall zone” is not located solely on the property
where the turbine is located, permission of the abutting property owner(s)
together with a recordable easement(s) depicting such agreement is required. 
Any such easement(s) shall be recorded by the Zoning Inspector at the
applicant’s expense upon the issuing of the zoning permit.
      (4)   The color of the unit, as well as the location and size of the
manufacturer’s identifying logo shall be included in the plan.
      (5)   A maintenance schedule, as well as a dismantling plan, that

stations.
1135.01  USE CHANGES; REGULATIONS.
   The lawful use of any dwelling, building, or structure on any lot or
premises existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of this Ordinance,
supplement or amendment, may continue although such use does not conform with
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, or any supplement or amendment made
after the enactment of the Ordinance. A nonconforming use of a building may be
changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted
classification provided no structural alterations are made. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming
use, such use shall not be changed thereafter to a less restricted use.
   (a)    In the event that a nonconforming use of any dwelling, building, or
structure and of any lot or premises is voluntarily discontinued for a period
of two (2) years or more, any future use of the lot, building or structure
shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Without the Board of Zoning Appeals' approval, a nonconforming use
may be extended throughout that portion of a structure that was obviously
designed and intended for such use. Also, a nonconforming structure may be
extended or enlarged by not more than ten (10) percent of the total floor area
existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. However, no
such extension shall encroach upon any minimum yard requirements nor shall it
exceed the maximum height requirement.
   (c)    When a non-conforming building or structure has been damaged by
explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of more than
seventy-five percent (75%) of its fair market value, it shall not be restored
or reconstructed except in conformity with the regulations of the zoned
district in which the building or structure is located except, however, this
section does not apply if the non- conforming building or structure is a single
family residence.  In the event the non- conforming building or structure is a
single family residence, the building or structure can be restored or
reconstructed as a single family building or structure if construction has
commenced within one (1) year of the event and completed within two (2) years
of the date of the damaged and continued as a non-conforming use.
   (d)    When a nonconforming use qualifies for reconstruction through damage,
a building permit shall be secured for that purpose and reconstruction shall be
diligently completed without delay. Failure to reconstruct within a year of
damage, revoke the right to nonconforming use and the premises shall conform
thereafter to the established district regulations.
   (e)    A use in violation of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance which
this Ordinance amends or of a Zoning Ordinance covering an area of a city,
village, or township subsequently annexed to the City of Rossford, shall not be
validated by the adoption of this Ordinance. 
      (Ord.  2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1135.02  ENLARGEMENT OF EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   If any structure was built prior to the adoption of this Ordinance and is
considered to have nonconforming setbacks, additions to, or enlargements of the
existing structure which presently encroach upon required side or rear yards,
may be permitted if the proposed addition or enlargement follows the existing
structure setbacks as long as the addition or enlargement will not exceed any
other lot lines. 
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1135.03  ABANDONED AUTOMOBILE SERVICE STATIONS, GAS STATIONS, OR FILLING
STATIONS.

station, gas station, or filling station shall be defined as one in which the
petitioner or lessee has failed to operate for at least three (3) consecutive
months in any eighteen (18) month period.
   (b)    All automobile service stations, gas stations, or filling stations
which use is discontinued after the enactment of this Ordinance shall be
presumed to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding property values
and to be detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
property, or general welfare of the community and shall be abated by the owner
of property.

and sixty (60) degree parking. The equivalent dimensions for seventy-five (75)
degree and ninety (90) degree parking are two (2) feet and four (4) feet
respectively.
   (b)    The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG)
requires all new facilities to meet ADAAG requirements. Approval of a plan by
City officials shall not provide a defense of a failure to meet ADA
requirements. For most uses, spaces designed as accessible parking spaces must
be provided in each lot or structure and distributed to serve all accessible
entrances and must in each case be located on the shortest possible route to
the accessible entrance.
      (1)    ADAAG requirements for accessibility of parking spaces will
require most uses to provide the following minimum number of accessible spaces:
 
Total Parking Spaces in Lot             Minimum Number of Accessible Spaces
1 to 100                                1 space, plus 1 space for each
                                        additional 25 spaces
101 to 200                              5 spaces, plus 1 space for each
                                        additional 50 spaces over 100
201 to 500                              7 spaces, plus 1 space for each
                                        additional 100 spaces over 200
501 to 1,000                            2% of total number of spaces provided
                                        (round fractions down)
1,001 and over                          20, plus 1 for each additional 100
                                        spaces (or portion thereof) over 1,000
Outpatient medical units and treatment  10% of the total number of spaces
facilities                              provided (round fractions down)
Units or facilities that specialize in  20% of the total number of spaces
treatments or services for persons with provided (round fractions down)
mobility impairments
      (2)    Accessible spaces are required to be eight (8) feet wide, with an
adjacent access aisle that is five (5) feet wide (one access aisle may be
shared by two spaces). The access aisle portion must be demarcated with paint
striping (that is, a single 13-foot wide space is not acceptable) and signed
with an ADA sign symbol. One (1) in every eight (8) accessible spaces is to
have an access aisle eight (8) feet wide (rather than 5 feet wide) and shall be
additionally signed “van accessible.”
   (c)    Where natural and/or man-made obstacles, obstructions, or other
features such as but not limited to landscaping, support columns, or grade
difference exist, the City may approve a reduction in stall width, stall
length, and/or module width as part of the site plan review process. In all
instances where a reduction is requested, attention to emergency vehicle access
shall be considered and incorporated into the parking lot design.

(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1136.15  GENERAL INTERPRETATIONS.
   In the interpretation of Section
1136.14 (Parking Space Requirements), the following rules shall govern:
   (a)    Parking spaces for other permitted or conditional uses not listed in
this Chapter shall be determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)    Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
   (c)    Where there is an adequate public transit system or where for any
other reason parking requirements are unusually low, then the parking space
provisions cited above may be reduced proportionately by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   (d)    Where floor area calculations are relevant to determine parking space
requirements under this Section, and except as otherwise provided herein,
"usable" floor area shall be employed as the standard. See Title VII
(Definitions).
      (Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1136.16  DEFERRED OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   As part of a site plan review process, the Planning Commission may waive up
to twenty (20) percent of the parking and loading requirements, as outlined in
this Chapter, provided that the space is reserved for the full required amount
of parking/loading spaces on the site and all drainage and appropriate
landscaping considerations are incorporated into the overall site design. The
Planning Commission has the authority to mandate, at any time, that the
required number of parking spaces be constructed when, based on evidence
supplied by the Zoning Inspector or other relevant information, it is deemed
that the demand for parking exceeds the number of spaces available.
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1136.17  ACCESS CONTROL MEASURES.
   In order to insure adequate vehicle access for uses, the following access
control standards shall apply:
   (a)    Driveways. There shall be adequate provision for ingress and egress
to all uses. For single- or two-family residential dwellings, driveways shall
be a minimum of nine (9) feet in width. For all other uses, driveways shall be
a minimum width of twenty-two (22) feet and may be located on more than one
property. If loop drives are approved as part of the site plan review process,
the width of an individual drive shall be at least eleven (11) feet.
   (b)    Numbers of Driveways. For parcels with continuous frontages under one
hundred (100) feet, only one (1) driveway is permitted for ingress and egress.
In the case of a corner lot, this driveway should be located on the street with
the lower traffic volume. For parcels with more than one hundred (100) feet of
frontage, a second driveway may be permitted following completion of a Traffic
Impact Study, as described in Section
1136.17(e)(2) (Elements of Traffic Impact Study).
   (c)    Conditional Approval of Driveways. As part of the site plan review
process, the Planning Commission may approve a site plan with a specific
driveway location, with the condition that an agreement be first entered into
between the property owner and the City requiring that if a service road is
constructed in the future, or if the opportunity for a shared driveway should
present itself with development of adjacent property, one or more approved
driveways shall be closed and measurements taken to utilize such service road
or shared drive. Approval of driveways may also include restrictions on turning
movements, locations, or other requirements to ensure safe and efficient
traffic movement.
   (d)    Construction and Use of Service Roads. When a service road is
required, such improvement shall be constructed by the developer of the
involved property before any occupancy or use permit is granted. When a service
road is provided, all access to an adjacent property shall use that service
road and no direct access to the main thoroughfare shall be provided, unless
contrary recommendations are made in a Traffic Impact Study pursuant to Section
1136.17(e)(2) (Elements of a Traffic Impact Study).
   (e)    Access Control for High Traffic Volume Uses. A Traffic Impact Study
may be required to document a development's impacts on internal and external
circulation and vehicular safety. Based on the findings of the Traffic Impact
Study and consideration given at the site plan review proceedings, a service
road may be required as part of the site plan review process, or a shared drive
approach may be required for adjoining parcels. Signal improvements, turn
lanes, and limited direction driveways may also be required.
      (1)    When Traffic Impact Study Required. Where a single development,
individual use, expansion, or change of existing use that would require site
plan approval pursuant to Chapter
1111 (Site Plan Review Procedures) results in generating one-hundred (100) or
more peak hour trip ends (as defined by the Institute of Transportation
Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation Manual), a Traffic Impact Study, is required.
      (2)    Elements of Traffic Impact Study. A traffic impact study shall be
prepared by a qualified professional engineer at the developer's expense. The
traffic impact study shall investigate the feasibility and benefits of
improvements such as signals, turn lanes, driveway movement limitations, and
other relevant information to the site to protect the safety of the traveling
public. The traffic impact study shall include the following elements:
         A.   A description of the site and study area.
         B.   Anticipated development of adjacent parcels.
         C.   Trip generation and distribution, including a description of all
assumptions used to generate findings of trip distribution.
         D.   Modal split (if applicable).
         E.   Traffic assignment resulting from the development.
         F.   Projected future traffic volumes.
         G.   An assessment of the impact that would result from driveway
alternatives.
         H.   Recommendations for site access and transportation improvements
needed to maintain traffic flow within and past the site at an acceptable and
safe level of service.
         I.   An evaluation of the effects the proposed development will have
on the level of service and roadway capacity.
   (f)    Access Control for Crossroads Boulevard.
      (1)    Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to provide technical
guidelines for future access to Crossroads Boulevard, from US-20 north to SR-
795. The boulevard represents a substantial public investment, and currently
provides four high capacity, free flowing lanes for through traffic. The City
is adopting this policy to preserve the safety and capacity of the current
boulevard, while providing additional access points as the surrounding area
develops.
      (2)    Access Category. The Ohio Department of Transportation’s State
Highway Access Management Manual is referenced as a general technical guide.
Crossroad Boulevard is classified as access category IV, an urban collector
with balanced access and mobility, with moderate volumes and speeds. The design
speed for access design is thirty five (35) mph.
      (3)    Access Principles. The preferred means of access for new
developments along the boulevard will be from established crossroads (i.e.
Deimling Road, Arena Road, etc.) with access to the boulevard at signalized
intersections.
         A.   Signalized intersections will be located at the locations shown
on the Access Policy Plan. The preferred signalized intersection spacing is one
half (½) mile, with a minimum spacing of one quarter (1/4) mile. Offset left
turn lanes will be provided in the median wherever that movement is permitted.
See ODOT L&D Manual Figure 401-6.
         B.   Between signalized intersections, one or two stop sign controlled
intersections (including a boulevard median crossing) will be permitted at the
general locations shown on the Access Policy Plan A-5 (See Attachments). Stop
controlled intersections will be allowed where justified by a Traffic Impact
Study (TIS) to serve high volume drives and service roads. All stop controlled
intersections will be two-way, with stop signs only on the crossing drives or
streets. Four way stop control is not permitted.
         C.   All intersections shall be designed to allow U-turns by an “SU”
single axle design truck, and for ninety (90) degree turns by W B-62 semi-
tractor trailer design vehicles, unless otherwise approved by the TIS review.
Left turn lanes will be provided where warranted by the TIS, following State
Highway Access Management Manual recommendations.
         D.   Signalized or stop controlled intersections will only be
permitted where the design accommodates current and future access to other
nearby parcels, with the goal of minimizing the total number of access points
on Crossroad Boulevard. All intersections shall be designed as ultimate cross
intersections, even if only a tee intersection is initially constructed unless
the land on the opposite side is already fully developed.  Minimum spacing
between intersections shall be six hundred (600) feet.
         E.   Between intersections, additional right in, right out direct
driveways will be permitted to access to the boulevard. Traffic crossing the
median island is not permitted at these locations. Minimum spacing between
drives, or between a drive and an intersection shall be two hundred fifty (250)
feet.

      (Ord.  2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1138.05  PARKING AREA SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS IN C, PC and PI
DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Perimeter Parking Area Screening. Perimeter screening shall
effectively conceal vehicles within a parking area from adjoining property
(along side and rear lot lines) with the selective use of plant, mounding, or
fence material for visual separation. A planting strip at least five (5) feet
in width shall be located along the perimeter of a parking area (along side lot
lines). Within this landscaped strip there shall be two (2), two (2) inch
caliper deciduous shade trees per one hundred linear (100) feet (or fraction
thereof) of perimeter parking area. There shall also be a four (4) foot tall
solid hedge or informal planting of shrubs (evergreen or deciduous) which will
provide fifty (50) percent opacity within two (2) years of planting.
   (b)    Interior Parking Area Landscaping. Landscaping within parking areas,
whether ground cover or upright plant material, is necessary not only to reduce
the generation of heat and water runoff, but to break up visually the expanse
of paved areas. The use of parking islands or peninsulas strategically placed
throughout the parking lot is required to landscape parking lot interiors. The
use of shade trees in these landscape areas is encouraged. Any open parking
area containing more than six thousand (6,000) square feet of area or fifteen
(15) or more parking spaces shall provide the following interior landscaping in
addition to the required perimeter screening:
      (1)    An area equal to five (5) percent of the total area devoted to
parking spaces and parking lanes shall be landscaped and permeable.
      (2)    Whenever possible, large parking areas of thirty thousand (30,000)
square feet or larger shall be designed so as to break up their visual expanse
and create the appearance of smaller parking lots. This distinction or
separation can be achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in
strategic areas and by taking advantage of natural features such as slope,
existing woodland, or vegetation, drainage courses, and retention areas.
      (3)    Landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in
peninsulas or islands. The minimum island or peninsula size shall be one
hundred eighty (180) square feet with a two (2) foot minimum distance between
all trees or shrubs and the edge of pavement where vehicles overhang and should
have a minimum width of ten (10) feet. Islands shall typically be located every
ten (10) to twelve (12) parking spaces and may be curbed.
      (4)    The required plant materials for the interior of parking areas
shall be one (1) deciduous tree for every three thousand (3,000) square feet. W
here site distance or maneuvering conflicts exist, trees shall have a clear
trunk of at least five (5) feet above the ground, and the remaining required
landscape areas shall be planted with shrubs or ground cover not to exceed two
(2) feet in height. 
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1138.06  FOUNDATION PLANTINGS IN PC and PI DISTRICTS.
   Foundation plantings are required along all exterior building walls that
face (or are nearly parallel to) a public right-of-way to soften building edges
and screen foundations. Foundation plantings shall be placed within five (5)
feet of the building perimeter. Foundation shrubbery shall be used to enhance
and highlight building architecture. Ten (10) shrubs shall be required for
every one hundred (100) linear feet of horizontal exterior building wall that
faces (or is nearly parallel to) a public right-of-way. 
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1138.07  LANDSCAPE STRIP IN PC AND PI DISTRICTS.
   A landscape strip shall be provided along the full width of a lot along the
right-of-way in the PC and PI Districts. (See Attachment A-3 (PC and PI
District R-O-W Landscaping Requirements).
   (a)    For lots in the PC and PI Districts having a front lot line that
adjoins a non-limited access state/federal highway or a road with a boulevard,
the width of this landscape strip shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet
measured from the right-of-way line away from the street.
   (b)    For lots in the PC and PI Districts having a front lot line that does
not adjoin a state/federal highway or a road with a boulevard, the width of
this landscape strip shall not be less than fifteen (15) feet measured from the
right-of-way line away from the street.
   (c)    Within such landscape strip, the area shall be unoccupied except for
the landscape treatment, signage, steps, walks, terraces, driveways (generally
perpendicular to right-of-way), lights, and other similar structures.
   (d)    Earth mounding with slopes not to exceed a three (3) to one (1) ratio
is required in this area, provided the design does not interfere with adequate
sight distances at public road or driveway intersections.
   (e)    Within the landscape strip, at least three (3), two and one-half (2-
½) inch caliber deciduous or three (3), six (6) foot high evergreen trees shall
be planted for each one hundred (100) feet of property frontage (or fraction
thereof) along with random shrub plantings, plots of ground cover or other
landscape treatments. To complement planned landscape treatments in the
adjacent public right-of-way, deciduous plant materials in the landscape strip
shall include species only from the following list:
      (1)    Homestead Elm (Ulmus Carpinifoloa “Homestead”)
      (2)    Pioneer Elm (Ulmus Carpinifoloa “Pioneer”)
      (3)    Frontier Elm (Ulmus Parviogolia “Frontier”)
      (4)    Athena Elm (Ulmus Parviogolia “Athena Elm”)
      (5)    Autumn Blaze Maple (Acer Freeman “Jeffers Red”)
      (6)    Autumn Applause White Ash (Fraxinus Americana “Autumn Applause”)
      (7)    Cimmaron Green Ash (Fraxinus Pennsylvanica “Cimmaron”).
   Evergreen plant materials, shrubs and ground cover may be any variety. The
use of decorative stones and rock features may also be included.
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1138.08  BUFFER STRIP REQUIREMENTS IN P, PC AND PI DISTRICTS.
   Buffer strips are required in the P, PC and PI Districts when side and/or
rear lot lines adjoin land that is either zoned to permit residences, or has a
residence (other than nursing homes, motels, or similar facilities) within one
hundred (100) feet of such property line. All buffer zones shall include
landscaped open space at least thirty (30) feet in width extending the full
width of such side and/or rear lot line. The buffer zone shall include an
earthen mound with slopes that do not exceed three (3) foot horizontal to one
(1) foot vertical and vary in maximum height between three (3) and four (4)
feet. All crests of mounds shall be rounded. In combination with the mounding,
plantings shall be provided such that the plantings and mounding will achieve a
combined minimum height of six (6) feet above surrounding contours, and a
minimum opacity of one-hundred (100) percent in the summer and seventy-five
(75) percent in winter, within three (3) years of planting. Naturally occurring
buffer areas, such as wood lots, may be preserved and utilized in lieu of all
or part of the preceding requirements, and alternative screening and buffering
improvements may be approved by the Planning Commission as part of the site
plan review process. 
(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed  4-14-08.)

(Ord. 2008-06.  Passed 4-14-08.)
1151.02  JURISDICTION.

   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape, or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations would result
in substantial hardship or injustice, such requirements may be varied or
modified by the Planning Commission so that the subdivider may subdivide his or
her property in a reasonable manner, provided that the public welfare and
interest of the City and surrounding areas are thoroughly protected and the
general intent and spirit of these Regulations are enforced.  (Ord. 2008-06. 
Passed 4-14-08.)
1151.06  AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
   These Subdivision Regulations may be changed or amended from time to time by
Council provided, however, that such changes or amendments prior to adoption
are submitted to the Planning Commission for study and recommendations and

      (1)   Wiring.  The wiring for electric heat shall be installed by a
qualified electrical heating contractor in accordance with the National
Electrical Code and local supplementary rules.
      (2)   Thermostats.  Wall mounted thermostats shall be placed on inside
walls fifty-two to sixty inches above the floor and away from sources of heat
and cold.
      (3)    Baseboard Units.  Baseboard heating units shall be placed on
outside walls, preferably under windows.
      (4)    Ceiling Cable.  Ceiling cable shall be spaced in accordance with
manufacturers' instructions and the National Electrical Code.
   (b)    Insulation.
      (1)    Ceilings.  Loose or batt type insulation with a minimum of R-29 is
required for all types of electric heat.
For first floor ceiling, in two-story structures, where radiant ceiling cable
or panel systems are installed, R-7 of batt insulation with reflective foil
facing shall be installed face down.
Where possible in cathedral ceiling and knee wall rafter ceiling areas, a
ventilation space between the insulation and the roof sheeting shall be
provided. A vapor barrier shall be used on the warm side of all cathedral
ceilings, and may be desirable on knee wall areas also. See vapor barriers in
subsection (c)(1) hereof.
      (2)    Outside Walls.  Loose or batt type insulation with a minimum R-13
value shall be installed on all exposed walls. This includes the narrow spaces
around windows and door frames, above heaters, etc, and also includes walls

      (3)    Floors.  Floors over unheated areas such as crawl spaces and
unheated basements shall have insulation installed with an R-13 value. If
possible, a three-fourths inch air space between the floor and the insulation
is to be provided.
When heating ducts and water lines are located in attics, garages and

         B.    Where less than fifty percent of the wall area is exposed to the
weather, approved insulation with a value of R-7 shall be installed in
accordance with the manufacturers' specifications.
   (c)    Moisture Control.
      (1)    Vapor Barriers.  A vapor barrier shall be installed between the
masonry wall and the insulation. In a properly insulated structure,
condensation on cold surfaces by water vapor passing into the spaces within the
wall, floor and ceiling areas can be controlled by vapor barriers installed on
the warm or heated side of all surfaces in contact with insulation. This may be
a component part of the insulation or separately applied. Vapor barriers in
ceilings may be omitted if proper ventilation is provided above the ceiling.
(See natural ventilation in subsection (c)(3) hereof.) An approved vapor
barrier shall be used in all cathedral and knee wall areas. The following is to

foot of outlet (net free opening) shall be provided in the attic for each 600
square feet of crawl space.
         C.    Breathing Space. For flat or slightly pitched roofs, a breathing
space of from one to two inches shall be provided above the insulation so that
trapped vapor can escape through vents to the outside. However, if a breathing
space cannot be provided, a vapor barrier shall be installed next to the warm
side of the ceiling. An air space between the roof and insulation shall also be
provided in knee wall areas.
   (d)    Infiltration.
      (1)    Windows and Doors.  All windows and doors not double glazed shall

person or his agent in the office of, and has been approved in writing by, the
Commissioner of Air and Water Pollution Control.
   (b)    The abovementioned plans and specifications shall show the form and
dimensions of the fuel-burning equipment and, more particularly, the proposed

burned per hour, the operating requirements and the use to be made of such
fuel-burning equipment shall be stated.
   (c)    However, maintenance or minor alterations which do not change the
capacity of such fuel-burning equipment and which do not involve any change in
the method of combustion, or adversely affect the emission of smoke, dust,
gases or fumes therefrom, may be made without such written approval. Further,
an emergency repair may be made prior to the application for and issuance of
the written approval in the event an emergency arises and serious consequences
would result if the repair were to be deferred. When such repair is made in an
emergency, application for the written approval therefor shall  be filed in
duplicate by the person or his agent in the office of the Commissioner on the
first business day following the starting of the work. 
   (d)    An application shall be approved or rejected within ten days after it
is filed in the office of the Commissioner.

installation or alteration shall be made which is not in accordance with the
plans, specifications and other pertinent information upon which the written
approval was issued.
   (f)    Substantial deviation from the plans and specifications on which the
written approval was issued shall be sufficient cause for the Commissioner to
stop all work; he is hereby authorized to seal the installation. Work shall not
proceed until the Commissioner is assured that such deviation will be corrected
and that the work will proceed in accordance with the plans and specifications
upon which written approval was issued.
   (g)    No person shall violate the seal of any equipment that has been
sealed at the direction of the Commissioner unless authorized by him in writing
to do so.
   (h)    Each day of work of such construction, installation or alteration in

   (i)    If construction, installation or alteration is not started within one
year of the date of the written approval of the Commissioner, such approval
shall become void.
   (j)    The issuance by the Commissioner of any written approval shall not be

   (k)    Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be
subject to the fine provided in Section

   (a)    No person shall cause or allow to be emitted into the open air any
foreign materials such as dust, gases, fumes, mists, vapors, smokes and odors
in quantities which, by reason of their objectionable properties, shall be
considered a nuisance because they:
      (1)    Injure or have a harmful effect upon the health or safety of any
person or the public;
      (2)    Create a disagreeable odor in the atmosphere;
      (3)    Cause damage to property;
      (4)    Have a deleterious effect upon trees, plants or other forms of
vegetation.
   (b)    No person shall operate or cause to be operated, maintain or cause to
be maintained, any equipment or device which, by its operation, will cause the
emission of dusts, gases, fumes, mists, vapors, smokes and odors without
maintaining and operating efficiently corrective measures while using such
equipment or device. “Corrective measures” means a method, device or
contrivance to reduce the quantity of dusts, gases, fumes, mists, vapors,
smokes and odors emitted into the open air, and which is operated in
conjunction with such equipment or device so that the quantity of dusts, gases,
fumes, mists, vapors, smokes and odors emitted into the open air shall not
violate the above provisions. Application of the provisions of this subsection
to specific cases shall take into account the number of boilers and other fuel-
burning devices connected to a given stack or chimney, because the emission
from a given stack or chimney is a function of the number of units connected to
it.
   (c)    No person shall cause or allow to be discharged from any fuel-burning
equipment, internal combustion engine, premises or open fire, smoke the shade
or density of which is equal to No. 2 of the Ringelmann Chart for a period
aggregating four minutes or more in any thirty minutes, or smoke the shade or
density of which is equal to No. 2 but not greater than No. 3 of the Ringelmann
Chart except for a period or periods aggregating three minutes in any fifteen
minutes when building a new fire, cleaning a fire or when breakdown of
equipment occurs such as to make it evident that the emission was reasonably
preventable.
   (d)    For the purpose of grading the shade or density of smoke, the
Ringelmann Chart as now published and used by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, which
is hereby made a part of this chapter by reference, shall be the standard.
   (e)    No person shall cause or allow to be discharged from any fuel-burning
equipment or premises or pass any convenient measuring point in the stack, dust
in the gases to exceed 0.85 of a pound per 1,000 pounds of gases, adjusted to
twelve percent CO2 content or the amount of solids in the Apparatus of the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers, revised and amended to date, which is
hereby made a part of this chapter by reference.
   (f)    All new installations of pulverized fuel-burning equipment, spreader
stokers or any similar suspension-burning types shall be provided with dust-
separating equipment as approved by the Commissioner of Air and Water Pollution
Control.
   (g)    No person shall cause or allow to be discharged from any fuel-burning
equipment, internal combustion engine, railroad locomotive, vehicle, premises,
open fire or stack, fumes that are a detriment to the property of others or
that are a nuisance to any person not being therein or thereupon engaged.
   (h)    All newly constructed or reconstructed solid or liquid fuel-burning
plants having more than 500 square feet of boiler-heating surface (fifty H.P.),
or its equivalent, shall be equipped with smoke indicators, mirrors or similar
devices, approved by the Commissioner to enable the firemen to observe the top
of his stack or stacks from the boiler room at all times unless the top of the
stack is readily visible to the fireman from the boiler room without the use of
such devices. In plants where a fireman is not in constant attendance in the
boiler room, the smoke indicator shall be of a type which will sound an alarm
or flash a signal to attract the attention of the fireman. Any existing plant
which emits unlawful smoke may be required to install such indicating devices.
   (i)    After any person or the owner of any premises has been previously
notified of three or more violations of this section within any consecutive
twelve month period, in respect to the emission of smoke, dust, gases or fumes,
the person or the owner of such premises shall be notified to show cause before
the Commissioner on a day certain, not less than ten days from the date of
notice, why the equipment causing such violations should not be sealed. The
notice herein provided for may be given by mail directed to the last known
address of the person to be notified, or if the person or his whereabouts is
unknown, then by posting a notice on or near the premises at which violations
have occurred. Upon this date the person may appear and be heard. Upon such
hearing, if the Commissioner finds that adequate corrective means and methods
have not been employed to correct the cause of such conditions, then he shall
seal the equipment until such time as the written approval of the Commissioner,
as provided for in this chapter, has been applied for and issued for the
equipment.
   (j)    No person shall violate the seal of any equipment that has been
sealed at the direction of the Commissioner unless authorized by him in writing
to do so.
   (k)    Each day's violation of this section shall constitute a separate
offense.
(Ord. 574. Passed 6-22-64.)
1321.05  TESTING INSTALLATIONS; NOTICE TO COMMISSIONER.
   Tests shall be made of the completed installation of fuel-burning equipment
or of air or water pollution controlled devices in those cases where this is
deemed necessary by the Commissioner of Air and Water Pollution Control, based
upon the advice of the Advisory Board. Such tests shall be at the cost and
expense of the person making the installation and notice of the time and place
of the test shall be given to the Commissioner. The City shall have the right
to test equipment to determine whether there is actual violation if the
Commissioner deems it necessary.
   The owner of any such equipment or devices or his authorized agents shall
notify the Commissioner in writing not more than thirty days after the
completion of any such installation for which plans and specifications were
filed and approved, that such installations have been completed and are ready
for tests. He shall, at the same time, inform the Commissioner as to when and
by whom the tests required by this chapter are to be conducted. The
Commissioner or his agent shall witness the tests. If the stated time is
inconvenient to the Commissioner, he may request a postponement to some other
reasonable time and the postponement shall be granted.
   Nothing in these rules regarding tests conducted by and paid for by the
owner or his authorized agents shall be deemed to abridge the rights of the
Commissioner to conduct tests of such installations on behalf of the City.
(Ord. 574. Passed 6-22-64.)
1321.06  WATER POLLUTION PROHIBITED.
   No person shall throw, discharge, dump, deposit or cause or permit to be
thrown, discharged, dumped or deposited any garbage, refuse, vegetable matter,
oil or oil refuse, filth, offal, putrid, toxic or unwholesome substance, or any
other substance which causes water pollution, upon the margins or banks or
within the limits or into the waters of the City.
(Ord. 574. Passed 6-22-64.)
1321.07  OBSTRUCTION OR INTERFERENCE PROHIBITED.
   No person shall in any manner hinder, obstruct, delay, resist, prevent,
interfere or attempt to interfere with the Commissioner of Air and Water
Pollution Control or any of the personnel of his Division in the performance of
any duty herein enjoined, or refuse to permit such inspectors to perform their
duty by refusing them entrance to the premises at reasonable hours.
(Ord. 574. Passed 6-22-64.)

department simultaneously notifying the Commissioner of Air and Water Pollution
Control of the type of structure, occupancy and use proposed.
(Ord. 574. Passed 6-22-64.)
1321.10  PROSECUTION.

1325.06  FIRE-DAMAGED STRUCTURES; REPAIR OR REMOVAL FUND.
   (a)    No insurance company doing business in the State of Ohio shall pay a
claim of named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the City
where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
insurance policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) and is greater than,
or equal to sixty percent (60%) of all fire insurance policy monetary
limitations unless there is compliance with the following procedures:
      (1)    When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and
the insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds sixty percent
(60%) of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the
building or structure, the insurance company or companies in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Director
of Finance of the City in the aggregate amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000)
for each twenty thousand dollars ($20, 000), and each fraction of that amount,
of a claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured or insureds and the insurance company or companies, the named insured
or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, shall transfer
from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City may be disbursed in accord with the policy terms. The
named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the
costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after
the transfer, and the Finance Director, after notifying the Director of Public
Safety, shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the
named insured or insureds, provided that the City has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure.
      (2)    Upon receipt of proceeds by the City, as authorized by this
section, the Finance Director shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be
used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio R. C. 715.161. When transferring
the fund as required in subsection (a)(1) hereof, an insurance company shall
provide the City with the name and address of the named insured or insureds
whereupon the City shall contact the named insured or insureds, certify that
the proceedings have been received by the City and notify them that the
following procedures will be followed: The fund shall be returned by the
Finance Director to the named insured or insureds when repairs, or removal or
securing of the building or other structure have been completed and the
required proof is received by the Director of Public Safety, provided that the
City has not incurred any costs for such repairs, removal or securing. If the
City has incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or
other structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds
remain, the City shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured or
insureds after repair, rebuilding or removal has been completed. Nothing in
this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to recover any
deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   (b)    Nothing in Ohio R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D), as adopted herein, shall be
construed to prohibit the City and the named insured or insureds from entering
into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or
insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
   (c)    The Finance Director is hereby designated as the officer authorized
to carry out the duties of this section, provided that no funds so held under
this section shall be released without notification of such intent to the
Director of Public Safety.
   (d)    The Clerk of Council is hereby directed to send a certified copy of
this section to the Superintendent of Insurance for the State of Ohio.

1327.01 NUISANCE PROHIBITED; DEFINED.
   No person or entity shall cause or permit a public nuisance to be or remain
in or upon any building, premises or other place, of which that person or
entity is the owner, lessee, tenant or occupant.
   As used in this Chapter, "public nuisance" means a condition that exists
when:
   (a)    Any building or structure is so out of repair and dilapidated that,
if it were permitted to remain, would endanger the life, limb, or property of
persons or property upon the public streets or public ways adjacent thereto by
reason of the collapse of such building or structure or by the falling of
objects therefrom; or
   (b)    Any tree, stack or other object standing upon property is in such
condition that, if it were permitted to remain, would endanger the life, limb
or property of persons or property upon the public streets or public ways
adjacent thereto by the falling of objects therefrom; or
   (c)    Any excavation or cellar upon property is unguarded or remains in
such condition that, if it were permitted to remain, would endanger the life,
limb or property of persons or property upon the public streets or public ways
adjacent thereto, by falling or being cast therein; or
   (d)    Any accumulation of earth, rubbish or other materials which attract
and propagate vermin, rodents, or insects that endanger the public health; or
   (e)    Any building or structure is so out of repair that it constitutes a
fire hazard because of its condition. For purposes of this subsection, a
building that is vacant, unguarded or open at doors or windows, shall be deemed
a fire hazard; or
   (f)    There is accumulation in any structure or on any property of rubbish
or other materials in an amount and in a condition that constitutes a fire
hazard by reason of the likelihood of its catching on or communicating fire; or
   (g)    The conduct of any activity on any property which by reason of
noxious odors generated thereby, or of smoke, dust and dirt being cast
therefrom, is harmful to the public health, welfare or safety, or materially
interferes with the peaceful and lawful use, comfort and enjoyment of owners or
occupants of a proximate property; or
   (h)    Any building, house or structure becomes so out of repair and
dilapidated that, due to lack of adequate maintenance or neglect, it becomes
unsafe for occupancy, endangers the public health, welfare, or safety of
occupants, or causes such a condition of blight that it materially interferes
with the peaceful enjoyment and lawful use of owners or occupants of a
proximate property; or
   (i)    The conduct of any activity on any property generates loud,
unnecessary or unusual noise or any noise which either annoys, disturbs,
injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of others; or
   (j)   There is an accumulation of any dirt, filth, rubbish, garbage, waste,
leaves or clippings, boxes, or any other matter of an unsightly or unsanitary
nature, in such a manner that such matter could become dangerous to the public
health, comfort and safety of others, that such matter could be blown into any
street, alley, park, public ground, sidewalk, or property of another, or such
matter could be deposited into any plumbing fixture that it may obstruct or
render unwholesome any sanitary sewer or watercourse; or
   (k)    Any swimming pool, pond or similar structure remains unfenced by a
fence not less than forty-eight inches in height, the openings to such enclosed
areas to be supplied with gates suitable to locking, when failure to fence
endangers the public health, welfare or safety of the citizens of the City; or
   (l)    Any condition exists which has been declared a public nuisance by
common law or the Ohio Revised Code; or
   (m)    Any building, fence, wall, shed, house, swimming pool, structure of
any part of any of the aforesaid; or any tree, pole or smoke stack; or any
excavation, basement, cellar, sidewalk subspace, wharf or dock, which in its
entirety or in any part thereof, by reason of the condition in which the same
is permitted to be or remain, shall or may endanger the health, life, limb or
property, or cause any hurt, harm, inconvenience, discomfort, depreciation,
damage, or injury to any one or more persons or to any other property in the
City; or
   (n)    Any dangerous building or structure which, because of their
condition, are  unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous to the health, morals, safety
or general welfare of the people of the City.
      (Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 5-12-14.)
1327.02  COMPLAINTS; INSPECTION OF PREMISES
   (a)    Whenever a complaint is made or visual inspection discloses to the
Zoning Inspector of the existence of a public nuisance as defined in Section
1327.01, the Zoning Inspector shall promptly inspect or cause to be inspected
the premises on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists. Should the
Zoning Inspector find that a public nuisance does exist, the Fire Chief and the
Wood County Commissioner of Health shall be promptly notified and such
officials shall be requested to make inspection of said premises.
   (b)    Upon receipt of the notice required by subsection (a) hereof, the

1327.03  SUMMARY ABATEMENT
   (a)    Should the Zoning Inspector, and either the Fire Chief or the Wood

Administrator or a designee shall cause photographs to be made of such nuisance
and shall file and keep in his or her office such photographs along with the
reports of the Zoning Inspector, Fire Chief, and Commissioner of Health
pertaining to the public nuisances. The City Administrator or a designee shall

in the property and immediately cause a written notice to be served on the
owner or owners of the property.
   (b)    Notice of the existence of a nuisance shall be served personally or

notice to be left with the individual, if any, in possession of the premises on
which the public nuisance exists, or if there is no individual in possession of
the premises, a copy of the notice shall be posted on the premises. If the
abatement required to correct the nuisance involves demolition of any
structure, then a copy of such notice, in addition to the notice posted on the
premises, shall also be served personally or by U.S. Mail, with delivery
confirmation, to any mortgagee, lienholder, tenant, or person that possesses an
interest of record in the property.
   (c)    The notice required by subsection (a) and (b) hereof shall state, in
brief, the findings with respect to the existence of a public nuisance by the
Zoning Inspector, the Fire Chief, and the Commissioner of Health. The notice
shall further state that unless the nuisance is abated within 72 hours after
service is made, the City, at the expense of the owner, shall thereafter and
without further notice take such action as is necessary, including demolition,
to abate the nuisance at the expense of the owner of the premises. The notice

1327.05 herein.
(Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 5-12-14.)
1327.04  NON-SUMMARY ABATEMENT
   (a)    Should the Zoning Inspector, and either the Fire Chief or the Wood
County Commissioner of Health, find that a public nuisance as defined in
Section
1327.01 exists, but the nature thereof is not such as to require summary
abatement, the City Administrator or a designee shall cause photographs of such
nuisance to be made and filed with the reports of the aforementioned offices.

cause a written notice to be served on the owner or owners of the property.
   (b)    Notice of the existence of a nuisance shall be served personally or
by certified mail on each owner with a return receipt requested. If service of
such notice is unable to be perfected on any owner by the aforesaid methods,
then the City Administrator or a designee shall cause a copy of the aforesaid
notice to be left with the individual, if any, in possession of the premises on
which the public nuisance exists, or if there is no individual in possession of
the premises, a copy of the notice shall be posted on the premises. If the
abatement required to correct the nuisance involves demolition of any
structure, then a copy of such notice, in addition to posting notice on the
premises, shall also be served personally or by U.S. Mail, with delivery
confirmation, to any mortgagee, lienholder, tenant, or person that possesses an
interest of record in the property.
   (c)    The notice required by subsection (a) and (b) hereof shall state, in
brief, the findings with respect to the existence of a public nuisance by the
Zoning Inspector, the Fire Chief, and the Commissioner of Health. The notice
shall further state that unless the nuisance is abated within 30 days after
service is made, the City at the expense of the owner shall thereafter, without
further notice, take such action as is necessary, including demolition, to
abate such nuisance at the expense of the owner of the premises. The notice
shall also inform the owner that they can request a hearing by making such a

(Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 5-12-14.)
1327.07 ABATEMENT BY CITY; COSTS AND ASSESSMENT
   (a)    Should the public nuisance not be abated within the time stated in
the notice given pursuant this Chapter, the City Administrator or an authorized
representative shall have the right to enter upon the premises to abate such
nuisance. In abating any nuisance the City Administrator or an authorized
representative may take such action as is necessary to complete the abatement
of the same and should it be practicable to sell or salvage any material
resulting from such abatement, the City Administrator may cause the same to be
sold at public or private sale at the best price obtainable and keep an account
of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds shall be deposited in the General Fund
of the City and any difference in the amount so received and the cost of the
abatement shall be reported to Council, which shall levy an assessment against
the premises upon which such nuisance was abated and cause such assessment to
be certified and collected as other assessments by the City.
   (b)    Should the proceeds of the sale of any material salvaged in the
course of such abatement exceed the cost thereof, the amount of such excess
shall be paid to the owner of the premises upon filing a claim thereof and
proof of title and right to such surplus.
   (c)    The City Administrator or a personal representative may utilize any
labor or equipment of the City in making such abatement or the City
Administrator may contract privately for the abatement of the nuisance provided
that Council authorizes the expenditures of such funds.

removal, repair, alteration, securing, boarding, or demolition of a building or
structure shall be paid by the owner of the land and/or responsible person as
provided in Ohio R.C. 715.261. If the owner and/or other responsible person
fails to pay for the costs within thirty days after receipt of notice from the
City Administrator of a statement of the charges and costs incurred, the City
Administrator may certify such amount to the Finance Director. The Finance
Director shall promptly make a written return to the Wood County Auditor of the
action under this section with a statement of the total costs and expenses, the
amount credited for salvage, if any, and a proper legal description of the
premises. Certification to the County Auditor is for the purpose of making such
costs and expenses a lien upon the property, to be collected as other taxes and

1335.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City of
Rossford, State of Ohio, does ordain the following.  (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-
13-11.)
1335.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Rossford has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSES.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
      generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.  (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.  (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Rossford as identified in Section
1335.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Rossford.
(Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING TEH AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps
are adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Wood County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Wood County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective September 2, 2011.
   (b)   Other studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.   
 
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Rossford as required by Section
1335.23(d) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Rossford Municipal Building, located at 133 Osborn
Street, Rossford, Ohio  43460.
(Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTION.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Rossford, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.  (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6- 13-11.)
1335.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.11  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood:  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.   
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 2 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Rossford's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.     
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Rossford's
Flood Insurance Rate Map, and May 2, 1983, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the

addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".

and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1335.24, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
      (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.22  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (d)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood

      (1)   For the purpose of these regulations, a watercourse is altered when
any change occurs within its banks. The extent of the banks shall be
established by a field determination of the "bankfull stage." The field
determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods presented in
Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply:
         A.   The bankfuill flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Rossford specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1335.20(a)(3) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.24  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Planning Commission of the City of Rossford shall be designated as
the Appeals Board for purposes of this Chapter.  Records of the Appeals Board
shall be kept and filed in the Rossford Municipal Building, located at 133
Osborn Street, Rossford, Ohio  43460.
   (b)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations and shall be authorized to issue variances in accordance with this
section.
   (c)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action
of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board. Upon
receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest, and decide the
appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (e)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (1)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Such application shall be accompanied by a fee of five hundred
dollars ($500.00).
   (f)   The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a public hearing within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for a variance from the
Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of such hearing shall
be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the community
at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing.
   (g)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (h)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (i)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (j)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (k)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
 1335.24(g)(1) - (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (l)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (m)   The Procedure for Hearings for Variances under this Chapter shall
conform to the following:
      (1)   All testimony may be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (n)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal such
decision to the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506
of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 2011-31.  Passed 6-13-11.)
1335.25  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations,
unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in
Section
 1335.19.
   (b)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a violation
of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with Section
1335.25(e).
   (c)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1335.25(e).
   (d)   Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that there has been a
violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall give notice of such
violation to the person responsible therefore and order compliance with these
regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (e)   Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply
with any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense,
and shall constitute a fourth degree misdemeanor. Any person who violates these
regulations or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the City
of Rossford. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Rossford from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. The City of Rossford shall prosecute any violation of these
regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.
