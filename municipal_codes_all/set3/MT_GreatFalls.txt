OFFICIAL CODE OF THE CITY OF GREAT FALLS

PREFACE 
    This code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with the 2011 Republication, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 3199, passed February 19, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with the 2011 Republication, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with the 2011 Republication, a Code Comparative Table has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

A.  Unless otherwise authorized by law, all City contracts for supplies and services must be awarded by competitive sealed bidding, pursuant to 3.08.030, except as provided in 3.08.040 through 3.08.060. Supplies or services offered for sale, lease, or rental by public utilities are exempt from this requirement if the prices of the supplies or services are regulated by the Public Service Commission or other governmental authority. 
B.  At the time the City or a department opens bids or proposals, if a supplier's current publicly advertised or established catalog price is received at or before the time the bids or proposals are opened and is less than the bid of the lowest responsible and responsive bidder or offeror or improves upon the conditions for the best proposal received using the same factors and weights included in the proposal, the department or purchasing agency may reject all bids and purchase the supply from that supplier without meeting the requirements of 3.08.030 through 3.08.060. 
C.  An office supply procured through bulk purchase or procured under a term contract may be purchased, without meeting the requirements of 3.08.030 through 3.08.060, from a supplier whose publicly advertised or established catalog price is less than the price offered by or under the term contract. A City office supply term contract must include a provision by which the contracting parties acknowledge and agree to the provisions of this subsection. 
3.8.030 - Competitive sealed bidding. 
A.  An invitation for bids must be issued and must include a purchase description and conditions applicable to the procurement.

E.  The request for proposals must state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors. 
F.  As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit apparently responsive proposals for the purpose of clarification, to assure full understanding of and responsiveness to the solicitation requirements. Offerors must be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals, and such revisions may be permitted, after submissions and prior to award, for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there may be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. The City may require the submission of cost or pricing data in connection with an award under this section. 
G.  The award must be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the City, taking into consideration price, including the preference in 18-1-102 MCA, and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals.

3.8.080 - Non-responsibility of bidders and offerors - nondisclosure. 
A written determination of non-responsibility of a bidder or offeror must be made and filed with the City Clerk. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly supply information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of non-responsibility with respect to such bidder or offeror. 
3.8.090 - Types of contracts. 
Subject to the limitations of this section, any type of contract that will promote the best interests of the City may be used, except that the use of a cost-plus-percentage-of-cost contract is prohibited.

In determining the amount and type of contract performance security required for each contract, the City shall consider the nature of the performance and the need for future protection. In determining the need for an amount of bid security, the City shall consider the risks involved if a successful bidder or offeror fails to enter into a formal contract; such considerations shall include but are not limited to the type of supply or service being procured, dollar amount of the proposed contract, or delivery time requirements. The City may adopt rules to assist it in making these determinations and in dealing with irrevocable letters of credit. Bid and contract security requirements must be included in the invitations for bids or requests for proposals. 
E.  If a bidder or offeror to whom a contract is awarded fails or refuses to enter into the contract or provide contract performance security as required by the invitation for bid or request for proposal, after notification of award, the City may, at its discretion, require the bidder to forfeit the bid security to the City and become immediately liable on the bid bond, but not in excess of the sum stated therein. The liability of the bidder or offeror, the liability of the maker of the security or bid bond, or the liability on the bid bond shall not exceed the amount specified in the invitation for bid or request for proposal.

Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods are subject to the availability and appropriation of funds therefore. 
B.  Prior to the extension or renewal of a contract, it must be determined in writing that:

2.  The average adult person applying contemporary community standards would find that the material or performance depicts or describes nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sadomasochistic abuse in a manner that is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors; and 
3.  The material or performance lacks serious literary, scientific, artistic, or political value for minors. 
B.  "Knowingly" means having general knowledge of: 
1.  The character and content of any material or performance which is reasonably susceptible of examination by the defendant; and 
2.  The age of the minor; however, an honest mistake shall constitute a defense from liability hereunder, if the defendant made a reasonable bona fide attempt to ascertain the true age of such minor. The defendant shall be required to prove this defense by clear and convincing evidence. 
C.  "Material" means any book, magazine, newspaper, pamphlet, poster, print, picture, figure, image, description, motion picture film, record, recording tape, or video tape.

Materials or performances may be deemed to appeal to the prurient interest when they are pandered, designed, marketed, prompted, or disseminated to cater or appeal to such an interest. Where the material or performance is designed for and primarily disseminated or promoted to a clearly defined, deviant sexual group, rather than the public at large, the prurient - appeal requirement is satisfied if the dominant theme of the material or performance, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex of the members to that intended and probable recipient group.

When the owner fails to properly maintain the curb valve and box and it becomes necessary for the City to shut off the water, necessary repairs or restoration will be made by the City, or if the service line fails between the City main and the curb shut off and the owner does not take prompt action for its repair, the City will shut the service line off at the corporation cock (connection to the main) but will not repair or replace the service line. In both of the foregoing instances reasonable written notice will be given the owner regarding the action to be taken by the City. The entire cost of time and materials will be charged to the owner. This charge shall be paid before the water service is restored. 
G.  Water will not be turned on at any new building until all water used during construction has been paid for. 
H.  1.  Water services three-quarters (3/4) inch through two (2) inches shall be of Type K soft copper from the corporation stop (connection to the main) to the entrance valve in the building or residence. Water services less than one hundred (100) feet in length from the curb stop to the building or residence shall be Type K soft Copper from the curb stop to the entrance valve inside the building or residence. From the entrance valve to a point a minimum of one (1) foot past the meter setting, the service material shall be of Type M of L hard copper pipe. Water services greater than one hundred (100) feet in length from the curb stop to the building or residence shall be Type K soft copper or HDPE, two hundred (200) psig meeting AWWA C-901 Standards. When HDPE, two hundred (200) psig is used a meter pit approved by the City shall be installed two (2) feet from the curb stop on the property side of the curb stop at the property owner's expense. Type K soft copper shall connect the curb stop and the meter pit. Pipe from the meter pit to the entrance valve inside the building or residence can be HDPE, two hundred (200) psig. Fittings used to connect the copper pipe to HDPE, two hundred (200) psig shall be all brass similar to Mueller "Insta Tight" fittings. When HDPE, two hundred (200) psig is used #14 THNN copper tracer wire shall be installed from the curb stop to the house in the trench with the service line. 
2.  Fire lines and domestic lines over two (2) inches in diameter shall be of C900 Class 200 PVC or ductile or iron. When C900 Class 200 pipe is used, it can run to a point ten (10) feet outside the building foundation. From that point the material used shall be of ductile iron the remainder of the way into the building up to the water meter or fire system apparatus. 
I.  The service pipe must be laid below final street grade and on the consumer's premises, at a standard depth (no less than six (6) feet) as designated by the City to prevent freezing. If shallower at the water main, insulation, shall be used to protect the service pipe from freezing until the standard depth is obtained. 
J.  Within two (2) feet of the point of service entrance to a building, and from one (1) to three (3) feet above the floor, an approved valve of good quality and good hydraulic characteristics must be placed so that the water can be readily shut off from the building. Full way gate valves or rotary valves, which include ball, cone and plug types are recommended. However, better quality compression stops or globe valves are permissible. The inlet side of any entrance valve shall be mechanically joined to copper service lines three-fourths-inch through two-inches by means of copper flare connections. If inlet side of any entrance valve on service lines larger than two-inches diameter shall be mechanically joined to the service pipe and property supported and restrained against movement in accordance with Public Works Department specifications. 
K.  No branch connection shall be made to a service line between the main and the entrance valve. Where a meter is required no branch connection shall be made between the main and the meter. 
L.  In areas where water service lines have been stubbed to properties with established property lines and said properties are replatted in order to enlarge lot size, only one (1) service line shall be used to supply the replatted property with water. 
M.  All other service lines shall be abandoned at the City main. Excavating shall be done by a properly licensed and bonded person or firm. All cost for such work shall be charged to the property owner.

Chapter 12 - INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT PROGRAM[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3050, § 1, adopted August 3, 2010, amended Ch. 12, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Ch. 12 pertained to sewer general rules and regulations. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

13.12.010 - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose and Policy . This Chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges from all industrial users into Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) and to any persons outside the City who are, by permit, contract or agreement with Great Falls, users of the City POTW and enables the City to comply with applicable state and federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 1261 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). This Chapter shall apply to the industrial users within the City of Great Falls and to any persons outside the City who are, by contract or agreement with Great Falls, users of the Great Falls wastewater treatment system. No industrial user shall discharge wastewater to the POTW unless done so in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. 
B.  The objectives of this Chapter are: 
1.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) which will interfere with the operation of the POTW including interference with the use or disposal of municipal sludge; 
2.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the treatment works or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW; 
3.  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system. These chapters provide for the regulation of discharges into the City wastewater system through the enforcement of administrative regulations. 
4.  To provide for equitable distribution of cost among the users of the POTW; 
5.  To provide for and promote the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens residing within the City and connecting jurisdictions; 
6.  To enable the City to comply with its Montana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (MPDES) permit conditions, sewage sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other applicable federal or state laws or regulations to which the POTW is subject; and 
7.  To prevent adverse impacts to worker health and safety due to the discharge of pollutants from industrial users. 
C.  Regulation of Industrial Users from Outside Jurisdictions. 
1.  In order for the City to effectively implement and enforce Pretreatment Standards and Requirements for all industrial users discharging to the POTW and as required by 40 CFR Section 403.8(f), the City shall enter into Intergovernmental Agreements (IGA) with contributing jurisdictions. Prior agreements shall be unaffected by these requirements until such time as the City determines that modifications are necessary. 
2.  Prior to entering into an IGA, the City shall be provided the following information from the contributing jurisdiction; 
a.  A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged to the POTW by the contributing jurisdiction; 
b.  An inventory of all sources of Indirect Discharge located within the contributing jurisdiction that are discharging to the POTW; and 
c.  Such other information as the City may deem necessary. 
3.  The IGA may contain the following conditions: 
a.  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to adopt a sewer use ordinance or rules which specifically require that all non-domestic users shall be under the jurisdiction of this Chapter for the purposes of implementation and enforcement of Pretreatment Standards and Requirements; 
b.  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to submit an updated user inventory on at least an annual basis; 
c.  A provision specifying that the City shall be delegated full responsibility for implementation and enforcement of the pretreatment program unless otherwise agreed to and specified in the IGA; 
d.  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to provide the City with access to all information that the contributing jurisdiction obtains regarding effluent quantity and quality from non-domestic users; 
e.  Requirements for monitoring the contributing jurisdiction's discharge; and 
f.  A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms of the IGA. 
D.  Responsibility and Authority of the City. 
1.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Great Falls Director of Public Works shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this Chapter. 
2.  The City shall notify in writing any industrial user whom he/she has cause to believe is subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or other applicable requirements promulgated by the EPA under the provisions of section 204(b) or 405 of the Act, or under the provisions of sections 3001, 3004, or 4004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Failure of the City to so notify industrial users shall not relieve said industrial users from the responsibility of complying with applicable requirements. It is the responsibility of Significant Industrial Users to apply for and receive a permit prior to discharge, whether or not the industrial user has been identified and formally requested to do so. 
3.  If wastewaters containing any pollutant, including excess flow, or as otherwise defined in this Chapter, are discharged or proposed to be discharged to the POTW, the City may take any action necessary to: 
a.  Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater; 
b.  Require an industrial user to demonstrate that in-plant facility modifications will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this Chapter; 
c.  Require treatment, including storage facilities or flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the potential for a discharge to violate this Chapter; 
d.  Require the industrial user making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the City for handling, treating, disposing or remediation costs as a result of wastes discharged to the wastewater treatment system; 
e.  Require the industrial user to apply for and obtain a permit; 
f.  Require timely and factual reports from the industrial user responsible for such discharge; or 
g.  Take such other action as may be necessary to meet the objectives of this Chapter. 
E.  Additional City Authorities. In addition to the overall authority to control the discharge of wastewater to the POTW, the City shall have the following authorities: 
1.  Take enforcement and issue fines and penalties for violations of this Chapter, including the failure of an industrial user to apply for a permit. 
2.

Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Director shall be provided, operated and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Director prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes. 
B.  The City may require industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specified sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and demonstrate the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. 
C.  The City may require any industrial user discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An Industrial Discharge Permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
D.  Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
E.  The City may require an industrial user to install at the industrial user's expense, suitable monitoring facilities or equipment that allows for the representative sampling and accurate observation of wastewater discharges. Such equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times to City personnel. 
F.  The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the building unless otherwise approved by the City. When such a location would be impractical, the City may allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or easement area, with the approval of the agency having jurisdiction over such street or easement, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles. 
G.  When more than one (1) industrial user is able to discharge into a common service line, the City may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each industrial user. 
H.  Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications. 
I.  Industrial users who discharge process wastewaters determined by the City to contain pollutants necessitating continuous pH measurement to demonstrate compliance shall, subsequent to notification by the City, install a continuous recording pH meter as approved by the City. Such meter shall be installed, operated and maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense. 
J.  If the City determines that an industrial user needs to measure and report wastewater flow, the industrial user shall install an approved flow meter. Such meter shall be installed, operated and maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense. 
(Ord. 2645, 1993; Ord. 2386 Exh. A (part), 1985, § 13.20.040).

(Ord. No. 3050, § 1, 8-3-2010) 
13.12.070 - Sample collection and analytical methods. 
A.  Sample Collection. Compliance determinations with respect to prohibitions and limitations in this Chapter may be made on the basis of either grab or composite samples of wastewater as specified by the City. Such samples shall be taken at a point or points which the City determines to be suitable for obtaining a representative sample of the discharge. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four (24) hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined by the City to meet specific circumstances. 
B.  Sample Type. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, and based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
1.  Except as indicated in subparagraphs 2. and 3. below, the industrial user must collect representative wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is required by the City. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the permitted discharge. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA. guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composited samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous local limits, including pH. 
3.  For sampling required in support of Baseline Monitoring Reports and 90-Day Compliance Reports required in Section 13.12.080. a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical representative sampling data do not exist. Where historical data are available, the City may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 13.12.080. the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
C.  Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analysis, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of an Industrial Discharge Permit application, report, permit or other analyses required under this Chapter shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the City or other parties approved by the EPA. 
(Ord. 2645, 1993; Ord. 2386 Exh. A (part), 1985, prior code section 13.20.110). 
(Ord. No. 3050, § 1, 8-3-2010) 
13.12.080 - Reporting requirements. 
A.  Recordkeeping. 
1.  All industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records, reports, monitoring or other data, applications, permits and all other information and documentation required by this Chapter including documentation associated with Best Management Practices.

a.  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples; 
b.  The dates analyses were performed; 
c.  Who performed the analyses; 
d.  The analytical techniques/methods used; and 
e.  The results of such analyses. 
Industrial users shall retain such records and shall keep such records available for inspection for at least three (3) years. This recordkeeping period shall be extended automatically for the duration of any litigation concerning the industrial user's compliance with any provision of this Chapter, or when the industrial user has been specifically and expressly notified of a longer records retention period by the Director. 
B.  Confidential Information-Disclosure of Information and Availability to the Public. 
1.  All records, reports, data or other information supplied by any person or industrial user as a result of any disclosure required by this Chapter or information and data from inspections shall be available for public inspection except as otherwise provided in this Section, 40 CFR Section 403.14 and the Montana Open Records Law (Mont. Code Ann. Section 2-6-401 et. seq.). 
2.  These provisions shall not be applicable to any information designated as a trade secret by the person supplying such information. Materials designated as a trade secret may include but shall not be limited to processes, operations, style of work or apparatus or confidential commercial or statistical data. Any information and data submitted by the industrial user which is desired to be considered a trade secret shall have the words, "Confidential Business Information," stamped on each page containing such information. The industrial user must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. 
Information designated as a trade secret pursuant to this Section shall remain confidential and shall not be subject to public inspection. Such information shall be available only to officers, employees or authorized representatives of the City charged with implementing and enforcing the provisions of this Chapter and properly identified representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality.

C.  Periodic Compliance Reports-All Significant Industrial Users. 
1.  Any industrial user subject to a federal, state, or City Pretreatment Standard or Requirement must, at a frequency determined by the City submit no less than once per six (6) months, unless required more frequently in the permit or by the City, reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practices (BMPs) or pollution prevention alternatives, the industrial user must submit documentation required by the City or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine compliance status of the industrial user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.12.080J. 
2.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that the sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
3.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the City, using the methods and procedures prescribed in Section 13.12.070. the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
4.  The sampling and analyses required for the reporting outlined above may be performed by the City in lieu of the permittee. Where the City itself makes arrangements with the industrial user to collect all the information required for the report, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
D.  Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMR)-Categorical Industrial Users. 
1.  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR Section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the City a report which contains the information listed in paragraph b. below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, New Sources, and sources that become Categorical Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable Categorical Standard, shall submit to the City a report which contains the information listed in paragraph D.2. below. A New Source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards. A New Source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged from regulated process streams and other non-process streams.

1)  The industrial user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
2)  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the industrial user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR Section 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the City. 
3)  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with Section 13.12,070 
4)  The City may allow the submission of a BMR which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures.

d.  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
e.  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; 
f.  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months; 
g.  Certification that the industrial user has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical; and 
h.  Signatory certification as required by Section 13.12.080 J. 
2.  Any industrial user shall notify the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of the discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261 and meets the reporting criteria specified at 40 CFR 403.12(p). Notification to the State and EPA is the responsibility of the industrial user and shall be made as required under 40 CFR §403.12(p). The industrial user shall copy the City on all notifications made to the State and EPA. 
3.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise allowed to be discharged by this Chapter, a permit issued hereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

13.12.090 - Sector control programs. 
A.  General Requirements. 
1.  Authority. The City may establish specific sector control programs for industrial users to control specific pollutants as necessary to meet the objectives of this Chapter. Pollutants subject to these sector control programs shall generally be controlled using Best Management Practices (BMPs) or by permits as determined by the City. These sector control programs shall not limit the City's authority to inspect, sample, require reports, enforce or otherwise carry out its responsibility under this Chapter. 
2.  Notification to the City by the Industrial User and Management Review. The City shall review new construction and existing facilities undergoing any physical change, change in ownership, change in operations, or other change that could affect the nature, properties, or volume of wastewater discharge, to ensure that current sector control program requirements are incorporated and implemented. 
3.  When a sector control program is adopted, the industrial users covered by that sector control program shall inform the City prior to: 
a.  Sale or transfer of ownership of the business; or 
b.  Change in the trade name under which the business is operated; or 
c.  Change in the nature of the services provided that affect the potential to discharge sector control program pollutants; or 
d.  Remodeling of the facility that may result in an increase in flow or pollutant loading or that otherwise requires the facility to submit plans or specifications for approval through a building or zoning department, or any other formal approval process of a city, county, or other jurisdiction. 
4.  Closure. The City may require closure of plumbing, treatment devices, storage components, containments, or other such physical structures that are no longer required for their intended purpose. Closure may include the removal of equipment, the filling in and/or cementing, capping, plugging, etc. 
5.  Variance. A variance as to the requirements to install a grease interceptor or sand/oil separator may be granted by the City for good cause. The facility has the burden of proof of demonstrating through data and other information why a variance should be granted. In no case shall a variance result in violation of any requirement or effluent limit specified in this Chapter applicable to the discharge. The granting of any variance shall be at the sole discretion of the City. 
If a variance is granted, the facility shall institute Best Management Practices and other mitigation measures as specified by the City. These BMPs may include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Provide quarterly cleaning of its private service line to prevent the buildup of oil, grease and solids; 
b.  Submit records of this cleaning to the City within fifteen (15) days of each sewer line cleaning; 
c.  Pay the costs incurred by the City for accelerated sewer line cleaning on the City's sewer line providing service to the facility, costs to the City for treating the excess strength waste and any costs for sampling and analysis. The City believes that these costs will be comparable to costs incurred by a user that installs and maintains grease interceptors or oil/sand separators. 
6.  Enforcement and Compliance. 
a.  These requirements form a part of this Chapter. Enforcement of this regulation is governed by the express terms herein and the enforcement provisions of Section 13.12.100 
b.  Any costs incurred by the City due to interference, damage, Pass Through, or maintenance necessary in the treatment and/or collection system shall be paid by the industrial user to the City. The direct costs of all labor, equipment and materials incurred in rectifying the interference or damage, including reasonable attorneys fees, shall be billed directly to the owner or the industrial user by the City, and such costs shall become part of the total charges due and owing to the City and shall constitute a lien on the industrial user until paid in full. 
B.  Trucked and Hauled Wastes. 
1.  General Requirements. The requirements established in this Section shall apply to persons and operators of companies who discharge trucked and hauled waste at the POTW, including any discharge that enters the City's sewer system. 
2.  Control Requirements. 
a.  Discharge Permits. No person or company shall discharge trucked or hauled wastes into any sewer system or treatment works until a discharge permit has been obtained. Such discharge permits will only be issued for the discharge of wastes from septic tanks, grease traps, privies, and sewer cleanings, and for the discharge of other non-hazardous materials and wastes which can be effectively and efficiently treated by the City wastewater treatment works. 
Individuals or companies desiring to discharge such wastes to the system shall file an application with the Director for a discharge permit. Discharge permits are not transferable to another vehicle or owner. Discharge permit application forms may be obtained by writing or calling the Public Works Department, City of Great Falls. Vehicles for which a permit has been issued must display such permit in a window of the vehicle during the discharge of wastes to the system such that it can be seen from the outside of the vehicle and will not obstruct the view of the driver of the vehicle. 
b.  Vehicle Maintenance/Operations. The permittee shall: 
1)  Maintain tanks, pumps, valves, hoses, racks, cylinders, diaphragms, pipes, connections, and other appurtenances on a vehicle in good repair and free from leaks; 
2)  Provide a safety plug or cap for each tank; 
3)  Ensure that the vehicle exterior is clean at the beginning of each work day (prior to entry to the POTW); 
4)  Clean the inside of tanks to ensure that non-permitted residual wastes are not left in the tank and allowed to mix with permitted wastes; 
5)  Ensure that tanks are an integral part of a vehicle to transport liquid waste. Portable tanks or other containers temporarily installed in vehicles are prohibited (unless prior approval is obtained from the City, e.g. portable toilets); 
6)  Piping, valves, and connectors (excluding the discharge hose) shall be permanently attached to tank and/or vehicle; 
7)  Tanks must be liquid tight and tanks constructed so that every interior and exterior portion can be easily cleaned; 
8)  Opening of tank to be constructed so that collected waste will not spill during filling, transfer, transport or disposal; 
9)  Outlet connections to be constructed so that no liquid waste will leak, run, or spill out from the vehicle; 
10)  Outlets to be of a design and type suitable for the liquid waste handled and capable of controlling flow or discharge without spillage and undue spray on or flooding of immediate surroundings while in use; and 
11)  Pumps, valves, cylinders, diaphragms, and other appurtenances to be of a design and type suitable for the type of waste handled, capable of operation without spillage, spray, or leakage, and capable of being easily disassembled for cleaning. 
c.  Discharge Permit Renewal. Discharge permits for discharge of wastes shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) years. The permittee shall apply for permit renewal a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the permittee's existing permit. Applications for such permit renewals for each vehicle may be obtained from the Director. If the renewal application is not received within the allotted time, the discharge permit will expire on the existing permit's expiration date. Once a permit has expired, discharge of trucked and hauled waste by the vehicle is prohibited. 
d.  Permit Suspension and Revocation. Any discharge or vehicle permit(s) issued in accordance with this Chapter will be subject to suspension or revocation by the City, at its discretion, for failure to submit accurate reports, failure to submit timely reports, failure to pay proper charges, failure to maintain the vehicle as required, failure to discharge at authorized disposal site(s), failure to meet sanitation standards, discharging of industrial sludges or other unacceptable wastes into the system, for any other infraction of this Chapter, or if the Director determines it is necessary to protect the City's facilities. The permittee shall maintain valid and current registrations, permits, and licenses as required by any local, State or federal regulation or requirement. 
e.  Reports. The person or company discharging trucked and hauled wastes shall provide a signed Hauled Waste Manifest to the City with each load that disposal is permitted. Copies of the Hauled Waste Manifest may be obtained from the Director. The City shall not allow the discharge of any trucked and hauled wastes to the POTW without a completed and signed Hauled Waste Manifest. Failure to provide a complete and accurate Hauled Waste Manifest shall result in suspension and/or revocation of the discharge permit, forfeiture of the performance bond and possible enforcement action by the City. 
f.  Authorized Disposal Site(s). Only those disposal site(s) authorized in the permit shall receive trucked and hauled waste. Disposal of trucked and hauled wastes at sites other than those allowed by permit is prohibited and a violation of this Chapter. 
g.  Sanitation and Safety Standards. Each permittee who discharges wastes to the system shall be responsible for the cleanliness and safety practices at the points of disposal. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to discharge wastes in such a manner as to keep the area clean and free from spills or other debris. Any spills shall be promptly cleaned up. The permittee is also responsible for keeping his vehicle and related facilities clean and in good repair while being used for disposal to the POTW. These sanitary and safety practices shall be carried out in a manner acceptable to the City and to appropriate health departments. Failure to comply with these sanitation and safety standards shall be grounds for revocation of the permit. 
h.  Quality of Wastes. Wastes discharged to the System under a permit granted by this Chapter shall be representative of what the permittee disclosed in the permit application and conform to any local, state or federal standards or requirements. The permittee consents to the City's right to sample and analyze the contents of any vehicle utilizing the POTW for the discharge of wastes and charge the user for such sampling and analytical costs. The purpose of such sampling and analysis will be to determine conformance with this Chapter, the permit and any local, state or federal regulation. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee's driver to assist in sample collection as directed by the City. 
i.  Performance Bond. The City may decline to issue or reissue a discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Chapter, a previous discharge permit, or any applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City of Great Falls, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the City to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. All trucked and hauled waste haulers shall be bonded in an amount of at least twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), indemnifying the public against damages sustained by any reason; any spill, dumping or discharge of any liquid waste, hazardous waste, or incompatible waste within the jurisdictional limits of the City. Proof of bonding shall be provided to the City at time of permit application. 
(Ord. 2645, 1993; Ord. 2336 Exh. A (part), 1985, § 13.20.142). 
(Ord. No. 3050, § 1, 8-3-2010) 
13.12.100 - Compliance and enforcement. 
A.  Enforcement Response Plan. The City may adopt policies and procedures as set forth in the City's Enforcement Response Plan for carrying out the provisions of this Chapter, provided that such policies and procedures are not in conflict with this Chapter or any applicable state or federal law or regulation. 
B.  Publication of Industrial Users in Significant Noncompliance. The City shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the Significant Industrial Users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in Significant Noncompliance as defined in Section 13.12.020 with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. In addition, any industrial user found to be in Significant Noncompliance with paragraphs 3, 4, or 8 as shown in the definition of Significant Non- Compliance found at Section 13.12.020 shall also be published in the newspaper. 
C.  Administrative Enforcement Actions. 
1.  Notice of Violation (NOV). When the City finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may serve upon the industrial user a written Notice of violation. Within five (5) working days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction or prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the industrial user to the City. The industrial user may also request a meeting with the Director to present further information and explanation. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the industrial user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the City to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
2.  Suspension of Service. The City, through the Director of Public Works, may suspend water service and/or wastewater treatment service and/or revoke an Industrial Discharge Permit (Section 13.12.050K.) when such revocation is necessary in the opinion of the Director, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the environment, causes Pass Through or Interference or causes the City to violate any condition of its MPDES Permit. 
Any person notified of a suspension of the water service and/or wastewater treatment service and/or the Industrial Discharge Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to individuals or the environment. The City may reinstate the Industrial Discharge Permit, water service and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. 
3.  Administrative Compliance Order. When the City finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that the industrial user come into compliance within a specific time. If the industrial user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the industrial user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
4.  Consent Orders. The City may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific actions to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. A consent order may include penalties, supplemental environmental projects, or other conditions and requirements as agreed to by the City and the industrial user. 
5.  Show Cause Hearing. 
a.  The City may order any industrial user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before an ad hoc committee appointed by the City Manager why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the ad hoc committee regarding the violation, the reasons why the proposed action is to be taken, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the ad hoc committee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or be registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation or other Authorized Representative of the Industrial User. 
b.  At any hearing held pursuant to the Chapter, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. The transcript of testimony will be made available to any member of the public and any party to the hearing upon payment of charges for the preparation thereof. The hearing may be suspended or continued at the discretion of the presiding officer, provided that all evidence is received and the hearing is closed within sixty (60) days after it is commenced. 
c.  After the ad hoc committee has reviewed the evidence, it shall issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate to correct the violation may be issued. 
6.  Administrative Fines. 
a.  When the City finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or requirement, the City may fine such industrial user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
b.  A lien against the industrial user's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
c.  Industrial users desiring to appeal such fines must file a written request for the City to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the fine. Such notice or appeal shall set forth the nature of the order or determination being appealed, the date of such order or determination, the reason for the appeal, and request a hearing pursuant to procedures outlined in Section 13.12.100C.5. 
d.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
D.  Judicial Enforcement Remedies. 
1.  Injunctive Relief. When the City finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or requirement, the City may petition the District Court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the Industrial Discharge Permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Chapter on activities of the industrial user. The City may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the industrial user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against an industrial user. 
2.  Civil Penalties. 
a.  An industrial user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of violation. 
b.  The City may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City. 
c.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the industrial user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
d.  Actions for civil penalties shall be civil actions brought in the name of the City. The City must prove alleged violations by a preponderance of the evidence. 
e.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against an industrial user. 
3.  Civil Fine Pass Through. In the event that an industrial user discharges such pollutants which cause the City to violate any condition of its MPDES permit and the City is fined by the EPA or the State for such violation, then such industrial user shall be fully liable for the total amount of the fine and/or supplemental environmental project that results from such action by the EPA and/or the State. 
4.  Criminal Prosecution. An industrial user who purposely, knowingly or negligently violates any provision of this Chapter or willfully, negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage or knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed or required to be maintained pursuant to an Industrial Discharge Permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or requirement, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation and be subject to imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. In addition, these penalties may be sought for any person who maliciously, willfully, or negligently breaks, destroys, uncovers, defaces, tampers with, or otherwise destroys, or who prevents access to, any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or any part of the POTW. 
E.  Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies that the City may have under the provisions of Montana law. The City may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant industrial user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Enforcement Response Plan. However, the City may take other action against any industrial user when the circumstances warrant and may take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant industrial user. 
F.  Public Nuisance. Any violation of this Chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or any order issued pursuant to this Chapter, is hereby declared a public nuisance and may be corrected or abated by the Director or his designee. Any person creating such a public nuisance may be subject to the provisions of the Great Falls Municipal Code governing nuisances, including the provisions requiring reimbursement to the City for its costs of abatement. Action taken by the City to abate any nuisance shall not be a bar to criminal or other civil enforcement of this Code. The Director may initiate, on behalf of the City, an action in any court of competent jurisdiction concerning the abatement of any public nuisance created or caused by a violation of this Chapter. In any such action, the Director may request any legal or equitable relief, including injunctive relief and civil damages, as provided by applicable law. 
(Ord. 2645, 1993; Ord. 2336 Ext,. A (part), 1985, § 13.20.120). 
(Ord. No. 3050, § 1, 8-3-2010) 
13.12.110 - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
A.  Prohibited Discharge Standards. An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in Section 13.12.030 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference and that either: 
1.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through or Interference; or 
2.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its MPDES permit, and in the case of Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements, or 
3.  The industrial user disclosed the pollutants causing the violation in the Wastewater Permit Application. 
B.  Upset Provisions. 
1.  For the purposes of this Section, Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
2.  Effect of an upset. An Upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of paragraph 3. are met. 
3.  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An Industrial User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of Upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(a)  An Upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the Upset; 
(b)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(c)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the Director within twenty- four (24) hours of becoming aware of the Upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
(i)  A description of the Indirect Discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(ii)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
(iii)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an Upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  User responsibility in case of Upset. The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
C.  Bypass. 
1.  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
2.  Bypass not violating applicable Pretreatment Standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs 3, and 4. of this section but are reportable under Section 13.12.080 L. 
3.  Notice. 
a.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director, if possible, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. 
b.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to the Director within twenty four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours. 
4.  Prohibition of Bypass. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless; 
1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
3)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3. of this Section. 
b.  The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph 4.a. of this Section.

Chapter 24 - STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY - GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

13.24.010 - Declaration of purpose. 
The City Commission finds that this chapter and Chapter 13.26 are necessary in order to promote sound development policies and construction procedures to preserve the historic, natural or constructed watercourses; to minimize water quality degradation and control the sedimentation of rivers, streams, ponds, lakes and other water bodies; to minimize adverse impacts on property owners adjacent to developing and developed land from increased runoff; to preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality of the waters; to maintain and protect valuable groundwater resources; to minimize adverse effects of alterations on groundwater quantities, locations and flow patterns; to ensure the safety of public roads and rights-of-way; and to decrease drainage-related damage to public and private property. 
(Ord. 2645, 1993; Ord. 2529 (part), 1989, §13.24.010). 
13.24.020 - Flood insurance. 
Floods from storm drainage may occasionally occur which exceed the capacity of storm drainage facilities constructed and maintained using funds made available under this Code. This Code does not imply that property liable for the rates and charges established in this Code will always be free from storm drainage flooding or flood damage. This Code does not purport to reduce the need or the necessity for the owner obtaining flood insurance and protecting his/her property from storm drainage. 
(Ord. 2645, 1993; Ord. 2529 (part), 1989, §13.24.020). 
13.24.030 - Property owners to provide storm drainage facilities. 
The City Commission further finds, determines and declares under all attendant circumstances that the owners of property within storm drainage basins in the City service area shall provide the storm drainage facilities necessary for the drainage and control of floodwaters and surface waters within storm drainage basins and shall provide the facilities required to convey such waters from the storm drainage basin to major drainage ways. Therefore, the cost of installing storm drainage facilities in the service area shall be charged in whole or in part against the lands in the service area. The City Commission further finds, determines and declares that all real property within a service area will be benefited by the installation of storm drainage facilities within the area since the development of elevated lands increases the runoff of storm drainage from such lands, causing increased amounts of storm drainage to flow onto adjoining lands of lower elevation. The owner of such elevated land shall share in the cost of improvements to reduce the possibility of such increased runoff from doing damage to other lands. To the extent possible, the rates charged by the storm drainage utility shall take into account the amount of storm drainage which will run off such lands. 
(Ord. 2645, 1993; Ord. 2529 (part), 1989, §13.24.030). 
13.24.040 - Storm drainage utility service area.

17.16.20.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  There may be instances where certain design requirements of this Title that if enforced may cause unintended and unwanted results, as opposed to a hardship where a variance may be the appropriate remedy. 
2.  Minor deviations from this Title may help to promote a better development and protect environmental and cultural resources. 
3.  A mechanism is needed to allow an administrative deviation from this Title when it can be shown that the grant of relief will avoid unintended and unwanted results and result in a better development. 
4.  Such a mechanism should be simple, handled at the administrative level, and be consistently and fairly applied. 
5.  Issuance of a design waiver does not imply or guarantee subsequent approval or conditional approval of any review process required by this Title. 
17.16.20.020 - Application and review procedure.

(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 8-17-2010)

The director of the appropriate City department shall not approve the application unless he/she makes a positive finding, based on substantial competent evidence, on each of the following: 
1.  The requirement would cause an unintended or undesirable result if applied to the particular circumstance and if relaxed would result in a better overall development design and/or protect environmental or cultural resources. 
2.  The exceptional and unique circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
3.  The applicant has no other option to improve the development's design or avoid negative impacts on environmental and/or cultural resources. 
4.  The request is not based exclusively upon a desire to reduce the cost of developing the site or to maximize the developer's profit. 
5.  The granting of the design waiver will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare or injurious to other adjoining properties.

17.16.20.080 - Appeal. 
Because the nature of a design waiver is discretionary, an applicant may not appeal the decision of the City department director to deny a design waiver application. If the board, commission, or official responsible for a subsequent review ratifies the issuance of the waiver, an aggrieved person may appeal that decision to the Board of Adjustment.

Article 2 - ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP 
Sections: 

17.20.2.010 - Types of zoning districts. 
The City is divided into a number of base zoning districts so that each parcel is located in at least one (1) district and potentially more. For each of these districts, appropriate types of uses are identified along with development standards. In addition to these base districts, there are a number of overlay districts. These overlay districts are intended to accomplish specific purposes that are not generally applicable to the entire base district. Where the requirements of a base district and overlay district conflict, the most restrictive applies. The zoning map depicts the location of the base districts and overlay districts used in this chapter. 
17.20.2.020 - Necessity of district designation. 
It is the intent of this chapter that no land shall be without a zoning district designation, unless specifically noted on the official zoning map. In the event a parcel is for any reason deemed to be without a designation, no land development may occur until such time as the City Commission has assigned the parcel an appropriate zoning classification. 
17.20.2.030 - Official zoning map. 
A.  Availability. An official copy of the zoning map shall be on file in the City Clerk's office and available for public inspection upon request. 
B.  Title. The official zoning map shall bear the title "Official Zoning Map - City of Great Falls, Montana". 
C.  Certification. The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor attested by the City Clerk. 
D.  Preparation of a new official zoning map. In the event the official zoning map is damaged, lost, or destroyed, and after each amendment to the official zoning map, the Director of the Planning and Community Development Department shall prepare a new official zoning map and submit it to the City Clerk for certification. 
E.  History of amendment. After the effective date of this Title, the official zoning map shall be accompanied by a descriptive history of each amendment that has been made, indicating the ordinance number and date of action. 
F.  Archive of superseded zoning maps. Upon passage of this Title, the Director of the Planning and Community Development Department shall keep a copy of each superseded zoning map in a permanent archive for historical reference. 
G.  Amendment. The amendment procedures in Chapter 16 of this Title shall be used to amend the zoning map. 
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 8-17-2010) 
17.20.2.040 - Establishment and purpose of districts. 
A.  Base districts. Different areas of the City serve uniquely different functions. The narrative below describes each of the districts. Some of the districts may share similar characteristics, but they possess one (1) or more uniquely different qualities that allow a distinction to be drawn between them. Although an area may not now possess each of the attributes in these descriptions, it is intended that as uses change over time they more closely reflect the intended uses. Uses are allowed in the various districts consistent with the development standards in this Title and development limitations that may be present, including steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands, riparian areas, and other environmentally sensitive areas. The City is divided into the following base districts as shown on the official zoning map: 
1.  R-1 Single-family suburban. This district is intended to accommodate comparatively low-density, single-family residential development on larger lots. Home occupations can occur in this district to the extent they are compatible with residential uses found in this district. 
2.  R-2 Single-family medium density. This district is intended to accommodate medium-density, single-family residential development on moderate-sized lots. Home occupations can occur in this district to the extent they are compatible with residential uses found in this district. Schools and other public facilities are often found in close proximity. 
3.  R-3 Single-family high density. This district is intended to accommodate single-family residences at the highest urban density. Home occupations can occur in this district to the extent they are compatible with residential uses found in this district. Schools and other public facilities are often found in close proximity. 
4.  R-5 Multi-family residential medium density. This district is intended to accommodate multi-family units not exceeding two-stories. Given the higher densities, these districts are typically close to work and leisure. 
5.  R-6 Multi-family residential high density. This district is intended to accommodate multi-family units of the highest density allowed in the City. These districts are typically found close to work and leisure, and are close to the downtown. 
6.  R-9 Mixed residential. This district contains a mix of housing types including single-family, two-family, and multi-family dwellings. All permitted existing residential densities in the R-9 district are considered to be conforming and are allowed to be re-established, if damaged. Any increase in density shall only be permitted as a conditional use. New projects developing under this classification must be at least five (5) acres in size and include a mix of housing types consistent with a set of prescribed standards. 
7.  R-10 Mobile home park. This district is for the exclusive use and development of mobile home parks. 
8.  C-1 Neighborhood commercial. This district is found near established and developing residential areas and is intended to accommodate low intensity commercial activities that serve the nearby residential area. Development standards ensure the compatibility of this district to those residential districts that may adjoin. 
9.  C-2 General commercial. This district is primarily intended to accommodate high-traffic businesses that focus on vehicle traffic. Where this district abuts a residential district, appropriate screening and landscaping will be provided to lessen associated impacts. Current residential uses are not considered nonconforming. As such, current residential uses existing at the time this Title was adopted are allowed to expand or to be re-established, if damaged. 
10.  C-3 Highway commercial. This district is intended to accommodate those commercial activities that primarily cater to those traveling on the interstate. As such, this district is only found at interchanges. 
11.  C-4 Central business core. This district is intended to accommodate and create a high level of business and social activity from morning through the nighttime hours. This district hosts a wide range of employment and businesses. Retail operations and specialty stores are common on the street level along with professional offices. Residential uses can occur in this district primarily on the upper levels of buildings. Entertainment occurs in this district and helps to create a destination. Sidewalk cafes and food vendors are common during the warmer months of the year. Off-street parking is available, but occurs primarily in multi-level parking garages and on-street parking. Civic buildings help to build a critical mass of activity. 
12.  C-5 Central business periphery. This district is generally found around the core of the downtown. It is intended to serve as a buffer between the downtown area and the surrounding residential districts. Although commercial uses are allowed in this district, they are typically businesses with lower levels of traffic compared to those found in the downtown area. Buildings are smaller in this district to create a physical transition in building bulk from predominant residential uses and the intensely developed downtown area. Buildings have setbacks and landscaping requirements. Exterior storage or display is not allowed. 
13.  M-1 Mixed-use. The mixed-use district is intended to allow a balanced and harmonious mixture of commercial, residential, institutional uses, and public spaces. Employment opportunities are near a variety of living options. A mix of uses could occur within the same building or in separate buildings in close proximity to one another. The transportation system and buildings are designed with pedestrians in mind. 
14.  M-2 Mixed-use transitional. This district is intended to promote a transition over time to a predominately mixed-use land use pattern. Because of changing economic conditions and other factors, some current uses do not represent the highest and best use, given other more suitable areas. Current industrial uses and warehouses are not considered nonconforming. As such, current industrial uses and warehouses existing at the time this Title was adopted are allowed to expand or to be re-established, if damaged, provided development and appearance standards under the purview of the Design Review Board are met. (See Chapter 28, Section 17.28.050.) Uses characteristic of this district are the same as those found in the previously described M-1 District. 
15.  PLI Public lands and institutional. This district is intended to include areas of significant public lands including public schools and significant public and quasi-public institutional uses or facilities. 
16.  POS Parks and open space. This district is intended to include lands that are undeveloped and unimproved, or are public parks or recreational areas. 
17.  PUD Planned unit development. A planned unit development district is a special type of zoning district that is proposed by the developer to account for a desired mix of uses. Each district is unique and therefore has its own set of development standards which are documented in the approval. 
18.  AI Airport Industrial. This district is intended to include all lands associated with the Great Falls International Airport including support uses and activities. 
19.  I-1 Light industrial. This district is intended to accommodate those types of activities typically associated with manufacturing of finished products, storage, and wholesale operations. 
20.  I-2 Heavy industrial. This district is intended to accommodate those activities associated with processing raw materials or other activities with potentially significant off-site impacts. Typically, the uses found in this district are not compatible with most types of non-industrial uses. 
B.  Overlay districts. In addition to the base districts enumerated above, the City is also divided into the following overlay districts as shown on the official zoning map to account for unique conditions or requirements as further described in subsequent chapters: 
1.  Neighborhood conservation overlay districts. This overlay district is intended to protect characteristics typically found in older neighborhoods. Design standards help to perpetuate the best features of the neighborhood as buildings are renovated, maintained, and potentially redeveloped. The provisions relating to this overlay district are contained in Chapter 58 of this Title. 
2.  Great Falls International Airport overlay districts. Overlay districts are established around the Great Falls International Airport to limit the height of buildings and other obstructions near the airport. Noise zones are also established around Great Falls International Airport to ensure that land uses are compatible with the continued functioning of the airport with special consideration on noise compatibility. The provisions relating to these overlay districts are contained in Chapter 54 of this Title. 
3.  Floodplain overlay districts. The floodplain overlay districts are based on flood studies conducted in the City and on approved floodplain maps. Each of the districts has unique development standards based on flooding characteristics. The provisions relating to these overlay districts are contained in Chapter 56 of this Title. 
4.  Southside business overlay district. This overlay district is created to recognize the historic design and utilization of existing structures in the commercial district immediately south of the central business core. Comprising mainly a portion of the C-5 zoning district and some adjacent properties in other zoning districts, this overly district allows for flexibility in use of existing structures while still maintaining compatibility with nearby residential areas. The provisions relating to this overlay district are contained in Chapter 57 of this Title. 
C.  Unincorporated land. Within the perimeter of the City limits there are a number of parcels that are not under the jurisdiction of the City. These are noted on the zoning map as "U". 
D.  Malmstrom Air Force Base. If property is sold or leased to a non-federal entity, the property may not be used for another use until such time the City Commission has assigned the property an appropriate zoning classification. 
(Ord. No. 2014, § 1, 9-17-2008; Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 8-17-2010; Ord. No. 3087, § 1(Exh. A), 6-19-2012, eff. 7-19-2012) 
17.20.2.050 - Airport related zoning map. 
The map of all airport related zoning shall be filed with the County Clerk and Recorder and the City Clerk. (See: 67-4-201(2), MCA) 
Article 3 - ALLOWABLE USES 
Sections: 

17.20.3.010 - Allowable uses within zoning districts. 
For the purposes of this Title, land uses are categorized as principal, accessory, and temporary. The land uses that are allowable in one (1) or more districts are defined in Chapter 8 of this Title. Exhibit 20-1 through 20-3 lists the uses as allowed in one (1) or more base zoning districts. The coding system, as described below, is used to identify the appropriateness of the land uses in each of the various base districts and the type of review if allowed. 
"P" indicates that the use is permitted in the district by right, provided that all other provisions of this Title are met. These uses do not undergo public review, but are reviewed at the administrative level to ensure compliance. 
"-" indicates that the use is not permitted in the district. 
"C" indicates that the use is permitted in the district as a conditional use. 
17.20.3.020 - Similarity of uses. 
Because the list of uses cannot include every conceivable type of activity, those uses that are listed shall be interpreted to include other uses that are of a similar nature and have similar impacts to the listed use. 
17.20.3.030 - Uses not listed. 
Those uses not listed, and which cannot be interpreted to be similar to any listed use, as provided for above, shall be prohibited. 
17.20.3.040 - Project classified in more than one (1) land use category. 
In the event that the proposed project includes more than one (1) land use category, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  Prohibited and allowable uses in project. If a proposed project includes both an allowable use(s) and a prohibited use(s), the prohibited portion of the project may not occur in the district. 
2.  More than one (1) review type or development standard in project. If a proposed project includes more than one (1) use, with different levels of approval, the strictest of the approval procedures shall apply to the whole project. 
17.20.3.050 - Relationship of a principal use to an accessory use. 
Before an accessory use may be established, the premises shall host a principal use. 
17.20.3.060 - Certain land uses shown as permitted may be a conditional use. 
A permitted land use (as shown in Exhibit 20-1, 20-2, 20-3) that emits air contaminants or potentially offensive odors outside of the building, or that handles radioactive materials, hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or regulated substances shall be considered a conditional use in every circumstance.

1.  The establishment of sexually-oriented businesses in business districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve residential neighborhoods has a deleterious effect on both the business and residential segments of the neighborhood, causing or contributing to blight and a downgrading of property values. 
2.  The establishment of more than two (2) sexually-oriented businesses within six hundred (600) feet of each other has a deleterious effect on surrounding residential and business areas and the fostering of such businesses within a close proximity tends to create a "skid row" atmosphere. 
3.  The concentration of several sexually-oriented businesses in the same neighborhood tends to attract undesirable quantity and quality of transients, a circumstance which adversely affects property values, causes an increase in crime and encourages residents and businesses to move elsewhere. 
4.  Concern for, and pride in, the orderly planning and development of a neighborhood should be encouraged and fostered in those persons comprising residential and business segments of that neighborhood. 
C.  Classification. A sexually-oriented business includes the following as defined in Chapter 8 of this Title:

No telecommunication facility that is readily visible from off-site shall be installed closer than one-half (1/2) mile from another readily visible, un-camouflaged or unscreened, telecommunication facility unless it is a co-located facility, situated on a multiple-user site, or blends with the surrounding existing natural and man-made environment in such a manner as to be effectively unnoticeable; or technical evidence acceptable to the Director of Planning and Community Development is submitted showing a clear need for this facility and the unfeasibility of co-locating it on one (1) of these former sites; 
5.  No telecommunication facility that is readily visible from off-site shall be installed on a site that is not already developed with telecommunication facilities or other public or quasi-public uses unless it blends with the surrounding existing natural and man-made environment in such a manner so as to be effectively unnoticeable or technical evidence acceptable to the Director of Planning and Community Development is submitted showing a clear need for this facility and the unfeasibility of co-locating it on one (1) of these former sites; and 
N.  Lighting. Lighting shall comply with the standards contained in Chapter 40 of this Title. 
O.  Vegetation protection and facility screening. All telecommunications facilities shall be installed in such a manner so as to maintain and enhance existing native vegetation and to install suitable landscaping to screen the facility, where necessary. To this end, all of the following measures shall be implemented for all telecommunication facilities: 
1.  A landscape plan shall be submitted with project application submittal indicating all existing vegetation, identifying landscaping that is to be retained on the site and any additional vegetation that is needed to satisfactorily screen the facility from adjacent land uses and public view areas. The landscape plan shall be subject to approval during the site plan review process. 
2.  Existing trees and other screening vegetation in the vicinity of the facility and along the access roads and power/telecommunication line routes involved shall be protected from damage, both during the construction period and thereafter. 
3.  All areas disturbed during project construction other than the access road and parking areas required under Chapter 36 of this Title shall be replanted with vegetation compatible with the vegetation in the surrounding area (e.g., ornamental shrubs or natural brush, depending upon the circumstances) to the satisfaction of the Director of Planning and Community Development. 
4.  Any existing trees or significant vegetation, on the site or along the affected access area that die shall be replaced with native trees and vegetation of a size and species acceptable to the Director of Planning and Community Development. 
P.  Fire prevention. All telecommunication facilities shall be designed and operated in such a manner so as to minimize the risk of igniting a fire or intensifying one (1) that otherwise occurs. To this end, all of the following measures shall be implemented, when determined necessary by the Building Official: 
1.  At least one-hour fire resistant interior surfaces shall be used in the construction of all buildings. 
2.  Monitored automatic fire extinguishing systems shall be installed in all equipment buildings and enclosures. 
3.  Rapid entry systems shall be installed. 
Q.  Environmental resource protection. All telecommunication facilities shall be sited so as to minimize the effect on environmental resources. To that end the following measures shall be implemented for all telecommunication facilities:

S.  Use of backup generators. Backup generators shall only be operated during power outages and for testing and maintenance purposes. Testing and maintenance shall only take place on weekdays between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. If the facility is located within one hundred (100) feet of a residential dwelling, noise levels at the property boundary shall not exceed an Ldn (Day-Night Average Level) of fifty (50) dB (decibels). 
T.  Visual compatibility. Facility structures and equipment shall be located, designed, and screened to blend with the existing natural or built surroundings so as to reduce visual impacts to the extent feasible considering the technological requirements of the proposed telecommunication service and the need to be compatible with neighboring residences and the character of the community. 
U.  Visual analysis. A visual analysis, which may include photo montage, field mock-up, or other techniques, shall be prepared by or on behalf of the applicant that identifies the potential visual impacts, at design capacity, of the proposed facility. Consideration shall be given to views from public areas as well as from private residences. The analysis shall assess the cumulative impacts of the proposed facility and other existing and foreseeable telecommunication facilities in the area, and shall identify and include all feasible mitigation measures consistent with the technological requirements of the proposed telecommunication service. All costs for the visual analysis, and applicable administrative costs, shall be borne by the applicant. The City may require the applicant to provide funding to the City to cover the cost of a second analysis if the analysis submitted by the applicant does not accurately or completely analyze the visual effects of the proposed project. 
V.  NIER (non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation) exposure. No telecommunication facility shall be sited or operated in such a manner that it poses, either by itself or in combination with other such facilities, a potential threat to public health. To that end, no telecommunication facility or combination of facilities shall produce at any time power densities in any inhabited area that exceed the ANSI C95.1-1992 standard for human exposure or any more restrictive standard subsequently adopted or promulgated by the City, county, State, or the federal government. 
1.  Initial compliance. Initial compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated for any facility within four hundred (400) feet of residential uses or sensitive receptors such as schools, churches, hospitals, etc. and all broadcast radio and television facilities, regardless of adjacent land uses, through submission, at the time of application for the necessary permit or entitlement, of NIER calculations specifying NIER levels in the inhabited area where the levels produced are projected to be highest. If these calculated NIER levels exceed eighty (80) percent of the NIER standard established by this Section, the applicant shall hire a qualified electrical engineer licensed by the State to measure NIER levels at said location after the facility is in operation. A report of these measurements and his/her findings with respect to compliance with the established NIER standard shall be submitted to the Director of Planning and Community Development. Said facility shall not commence normal operations until it complies with, or has been modified, to comply with this standard. Proof of said compliance shall be a certification provided by the engineer who prepared the original report. In order to assure the objectivity of the analysis, the City may require, at the applicant's expense, independent verification of the results of the analysis. 
2.  Ongoing compliance. Every telecommunication facility within four hundred (400) feet of an inhabited area and all broadcast radio and television facilities shall demonstrate continued compliance with the NIER standard established by this section. Every five (5) years a report listing each transmitter and antenna present at the facility and the effective radiated power radiated shall be submitted to the Director of Planning and Community Development. If either the equipment or effective radiated power has changed, calculations specifying NIER levels in the inhabited areas where said levels are projected to be highest shall be prepared. NIER calculations shall also be prepared every time the adopted NIER standard changes. If calculated levels in either of these cases exceed eighty (80) percent of the standard established by this section, the operator of the facility shall hire a qualified electrical engineer licensed by the State to measure the actual NIER levels produced. A report of these calculations, required measurements, if any, and the author's/engineer's findings with respect to compliance with the current NIER standard shall be submitted to the Director of Planning and Community Development within five (5) years of facility approval and every five (5) years thereafter. In the case of a change in the standard, the required report shall be submitted within ninety (90) days of the date said change becomes effective. 
3.  Failure to submit required reports. Failure to supply the required reports or to remain in continued compliance with the NIER standard established by this section shall be grounds for revocation of the use permit or other entitlement. 
W.  Co-located and multiple-user facilities. An analysis shall be prepared by or on behalf of the applicant, which identifies all reasonable, technically feasible, alternative locations and/or facilities which would provide the proposed telecommunication service. The intention of the alternatives analysis is to present alternative strategies which would minimize the number, size, and adverse environmental impacts of facilities necessary to provide the needed services to the City and surrounding rural and urban areas. The analysis shall address the potential for co-location at an existing or a new site and the potential to locate facilities as close as possible to the intended service area. It shall also explain the rationale for selection of the proposed site in view of the relative merits of any of the feasible alternatives. Approval of the project is subject to a finding that the proposed site results in fewer or less severe environmental impacts than any feasible alternative site. The City may require independent verification of this analysis at the applicant's expense. Facilities which are not proposed to be co-located with another telecommunication facility shall provide a written explanation why the subject facility is not a candidate for co-location. 
1.  All co-located and multiple-user telecommunication facilities shall be designed to promote facility and site sharing. To this end telecommunication towers and necessary appurtenances, including but not limited to, parking areas, access roads, utilities and equipment buildings shall be shared by site users when, in the determination of the Director of Planning and Community Development, this will minimize overall visual impact to the community. 
2.  The facility shall make available unused space for co-location of other telecommunication facilities, including space for these entities providing similar, competing services. A good faith effort in achieving co-location shall be required of the host entity. Requests for utilization of facility space and responses to such requests shall be made in a timely manner and in writing and copies shall be provided to the City. Unresolved disputes may be mediated by the Board of Adjustment. Co-location is not required in cases where the addition of the new service or facilities would cause quality of service impairment to the existing facility or if it became necessary for the host to go off-line for a significant period of time. 
3.  Approval for the establishment of facilities improved with an existing microwave band or other public service use or facility, which creates interference or interference is anticipated as a result of said establishment of additional facilities, shall include provisions for the relocation of said existing public use facilities. All costs associated with said relocation shall be borne by the applicant for the additional facilities. 
X.  Waiver. The City Commission may grant a waiver to the requirements specified in this section when the waiver would not increase the visibility of the facility or decrease public safety. Tower setback requirements may be waived when: 
1.  The facility is proposed to be co-located onto an existing, legally-established telecommunication tower; or 
2.  The reduced setback enables further mitigation of adverse visual and other environmental impacts than would otherwise be possible.

Chapter 24 - SUBDIVISION AND PLATTING 
Sections: 

17.24.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  The Montana Subdivision and Platting Act (MSPA) - Title 76, Chapter 3, MCA, requires each county, city, and town to adopt subdivision regulations consistent with the act. 
2.  The subdivision of land directly affects the form and function of the City and the quality of life of City residents. 
3.  Subdivision regulations are needed to recognize and balance the sometimes diverse interests in the subdivision process. 
4.  The Montana Subdivision and Platting Act prohibits a local unit of government from adopting subdivision regulations that are more stringent than State requirements, unless the local unit of government makes a written finding, after a public hearing and public comment and based on evidence in the public record, that the local standard or requirement (a) protects public health or the environment; and (b) can mitigate harm to the public or environment and is achievable under current technology. 
5.  Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be more stringent than State requirements. 
6.  The provisions of this chapter are adopted in accordance with the City's adopted growth policy. 
17.24.020 - Purpose. 
This chapter is established to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes: 
1.  Prevent the overcrowding of land. 
2.  Lessen congestion in the streets and highways. 
3.  Provide for adequate light, air, water supply, sewage disposal, parks and recreation areas, ingress and egress, and other public improvements. 
4.  Require development to be in harmony with the natural environment. 
5.  Protect the rights of property owners. 
6.  Require uniform monumentation of land subdivisions and transferring interests in real property by reference to a plat or certificate of survey. 
7.  Comply with the requirements of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act (MSPA) - Title 76, Chapter 3, MCA. 
8.  Implement the City's adopted growth policy. 
17.24.030 - Applicability. 
This chapter applies to all subdivisions submitted for review after the effective date of this Title. The design and development standards do not apply to existing subdivisions and/or lots, unless they are further subdivided. 
17.24.040 - Exemptions. 
A.  Exemption for certain divisions of land (See: 76-3-201, MCA). Unless the method of disposition is adopted for the purpose of evading this chapter, the requirements of this chapter do not apply to any of the following: 
1.  A division of land created by order of any court of record in this State or by operation of law or that, in the absence of agreement between the parties to the sale, could be created by an order of any court in this State pursuant to the law of eminent domain, Title 70, Chapter 30, MCA. Before a court of record orders a division of land, the court shall notify the City Commission of the pending division and allow the City Commission to present written comment on the division. 
2.  A division of land created to provide security for mortgages, liens, or trust indentures for the purpose of construction, improvements to the land being divided, or refinancing purposes. This exemption applies to the following: 
a.  A division of land of any size. 
b.  If the land that is divided is not conveyed to any entity other than the financial or lending institution to which the mortgage, lien, or trust indenture was given or to a purchaser upon foreclosure of the mortgage, lien, or trust indenture. A transfer of the divided land, by the owner of the property at the time that the land was divided, to any party other than those identified in this subsection subjects the division of land to the requirements of this chapter. 
c.  To a parcel that is created to provide security. The remainder of the tract of land is subject to the provisions of this chapter if applicable. 
3.  A division of land that creates an interest in oil, gas, minerals, or water that is severed from the surface ownership of real property. 
4.  A division of land that creates cemetery lots. 
5.  A division of land created by the reservation of a life estate. 
6.  A division of land created by lease or rental for farming and agricultural purposes. 
7.  A division of land in a location over which the State does not have jurisdiction. 
8.  A division of land created for rights-of-way or utility sites. A subsequent change in the use of the land to a residential, commercial, or industrial use is subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  Structures on complying subdivided lands (See: 76-3-202, MCA). When the land upon which an improvement is situated has been subdivided in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the sale, rent, lease, or other conveyance of one (1) or more parts of a building, structure, or other improvement situated on one (1) or more parcels of land is not a division of land and is therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
C.  Certain condominiums (See: 76-3-203, MCA). Condominiums constructed on land divided in compliance with this chapter are exempt from the provisions of this chapter if: 
1.  the approval of the original division of land expressly contemplated the construction of the condominiums and any applicable park dedication requirements in 76-3-621, MCA are complied with; or 
2.  the condominium proposal is in conformance with the zoning regulations contained in this Title. 
D.  Conveyances of one (1) or more parts of a structure or improvement (See: 76-3-204, MCA). The sale, rent, lease, or other conveyance of one (1) or more parts of a building, structure, or other improvement, whether existing or proposed, is not a division of land, as that term is defined in this chapter, and is not subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
E.  Airport land and State-owned lands (See: 76-3-205, MCA). A division of land created by lease or rental of contiguous airport-related land owned by a city, a county, the State, or a municipal or regional airport authority is not subject to the requirements of this chapter if the lease or rental is for onsite weather or air navigation facilities, the manufacture, maintenance, and storage of aircraft, or air carrier-related activities. A division of State-owned land is not subject to the requirements of this chapter unless the division creates a second or subsequent parcel from a single tract for sale, rent, or lease for residential purposes after July 1, 1974. 
F.  Conveyances executed prior to July 1, 1974 (See: 76-3-206, MCA). The requirements of this chapter do not apply to deeds, contracts, leases, or other conveyances executed prior to July 1, 1974. 
G.  Subdivisions exempted from review but subject to survey requirements and zoning regulations (See: 76-3-207, MCA). Unless the method of disposition is adopted for the purpose of evading this chapter, the following are not subdivisions under this chapter but are subject to the surveying requirements of 76-3-401, MCA and zoning regulations provided by Chapter 20 of this Title: 
(Ord. 2950, 2007) 
1.  A division of land made outside of platted subdivisions for the purpose of relocating common boundary lines between adjoining properties; 
2.  A division of land made outside of platted subdivisions for the purpose of a single gift or sale in the county to each member of the landowner's immediate family; 
3.  A division of land made outside of platted subdivisions by gift, sale, or agreement to buy and sell in which the parties to the transaction enter a covenant running with the land and revocable only by mutual consent of the governing body and the property owner that the divided land will be used exclusively for agricultural purposes. A change in use of the land exempted for anything other than agricultural purposes subjects the division to the provisions of this chapter. 
4.  Relocation of common boundaries affecting five (5) or fewer lots within a platted subdivision. 
5.  Aggregation of lots within a platted subdivision. 
6.  Relocation of a common boundary line between a single lot within a platted subdivision and adjoining land outside a platted subdivision. A restriction or requirement on the original platted lot or original unplatted parcel continues to apply to those areas. 
A division of land may not be made under this section unless the County Treasurer has certified that all real property taxes and special assessments assessed and levied on the land to be divided have been paid. If a division of land includes centrally assessed property and the property taxes applicable to the division of land are not specifically identified in the tax assessment, the department of revenue shall prorate the taxes applicable to the land being divided on a reasonable basis. The owner of the centrally assessed property shall ensure that the prorated real property taxes and special assessments are paid on the land being sold before the division of land is made. The County Treasurer may accept the amount of the tax prorated pursuant to this subsection as a partial payment of the total tax that is due. 
H.  Subdivisions exempted from surveying and filing requirements but subject to review provisions (See: 76-3-208, MCA). Subdivisions created by rent or lease are exempt from the surveying and filing requirements of this chapter but must be submitted for review and approved by the City Commission before portions thereof may be rented or leased. 
I.  Exemption from surveying and platting requirements for lands acquired for State highways (See: 76-3-209, MCA). Instruments of transfer of land which are acquired for State highways may refer by parcel and project number to State highway plans which have been recorded in compliance with 60-2-209, MCA, and are exempted from the surveying and platting requirements of this chapter. If such parcels are not shown on highway plans of record, instruments of transfer of such parcels shall be accompanied by and refer to appropriate certificates of survey and plats when presented for recording. 
17.24.050 - Effect of recorded plat. 
A final subdivision plat once recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder creates each of the parcels so noted on the plat. A recorded plat may be vacated in whole, or in part, consistent with 76-3-305, MCA. Writing (e.g., notations or statements) on the face of the plat, which relate to the lots being created, shall run with the land, as may be applicable to each parcel, and be binding on each and every property owner of said parcel. 
17.24.060 - Construction timing. 
The subdivider shall not proceed with any construction work, including grading and excavation relating to public improvements, until the governing body has approved the preliminary plat and other permits as may be required by this Title or State law, have been obtained. 
17.24.070 - Title transfers. 
A final subdivision plat shall be filed with the County Clerk and Recorder before title to the subdivided land may be sold or transferred in any manner. After the preliminary plat of a subdivision has been approved, or conditionally approved, the subdivider may enter into contracts to sell lots in the proposed subdivision if all of the following circumstances are met (See: 76-3-303, MCA): 
1.  Under the terms of the contracts the purchasers of lots in the proposed subdivision make any payments to an escrow agent, which must be a bank or savings and loan association chartered to do business in Montana. 
2.  Under the terms of the contracts and the escrow agreement, the payments made by purchasers of lots in the proposed subdivision may not be distributed by the escrow agent to the subdivider until the final plat of the subdivision is filed with the County Clerk and Recorder. 
3.  The contracts and the escrow agreement provide that if the final plat of the proposed subdivision is not filed with the County Clerk and Recorder within two (2) years of the preliminary plat approval, the escrow agent shall immediately refund to each purchaser any payments he has made under the contract. 
4.  The County Treasurer has certified that no real property taxes assessed and levied on the land to be divided are delinquent. 
5.  The contracts conspicuously contain the following language: "The real property which is the subject hereof has not been finally platted, and until a final plat identifying the property has been filed with the County Clerk and Recorder, title to the property cannot be transferred in any manner." 
17.24.080 - Overall development plan. 
When a proposed subdivision does not cover the entire parcel and the remainder has development potential, the subdivider shall prepare and submit an overall development plan for the entire property as part of the subdivision application. While the submittal of an overall development plan does not bind future development of the remainder, it ensures that the development of the entire property will be coordinated and well conceived. 
17.24.090 - Disposition of water rights. 
If a subdivision will create lots averaging less than five (5) acres in size, the subdivider shall submit evidence with the final plat that the subdivider has: 
1.  Reserved all or a portion of the appropriation water rights owned by the owner of the land to be subdivided and transferred these water rights to a single entity for use by landowners within the subdivision who have a legal right to the water and reserved and severed any remaining surface water rights from the land; 
2.  If the land to be subdivided is subject to a contract or interest in a public or private entity formed to provide for the use of a water right on the subdivision lots, established a landowner's water use agreement administered through a single entity. This agreement must specify how the water rights will be administered and describe the rights and responsibilities of landowners within the subdivision who have a legal right and access to the water; or 
3.  Reserved and severed all surface water rights from the land proposed for subdivision. 
17.24.100 - Subdivision design principles. 
A.  Generally. Subdivisions shall be designed to avoid adverse impacts. If avoidance of an adverse impact is not possible, then that impact shall be minimized to an acceptable level, if possible, and mitigated as appropriate. It is recognized that unmitigated impacts may be unacceptable and may preclude approval (76-3-608(5), MCA). 
B.  Building sites. The design and development of a subdivision shall provide satisfactory building sites, which are properly related to topography, and shall, to the extent possible, preserve the natural terrain, natural drainage, trees, and other existing vegetation. 
C.  Specific standards. Subdivisions shall be designed to: 
1.  Minimize the amount of impervious surface within the subdivision. 
2.  Preserve the character of the surrounding area. 
3.  Preserve natural features, including wetlands, riparian habitat, and drainage ways. 
4.  Promote a walkable and bicycle-friendly community. 
5.  Create street continuity and an interconnected street network. 
6.  Accommodate the housing needs of City residents. 
7.  Promote other purposes in the City's growth policy plan. 
17.24.110 - Lots. 
A.  Lot design. Lots shall conform to the following standards: 
1.  No lot shall be divided by another parcel, by a public street right-of-way, or by a private road easement. 
2.  No lot shall be divided by a municipal boundary. 
3.  Each lot shall abut a public or private street that meets the standards of this Title and provides legal and physical access. 
4.  Side lot lines shall be at substantially right angles to straight road lines and radial to curved road lines. 
5.  Double frontage lots may only be used to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. Physical and legal access shall only be provided off of the street with the lowest street classification. 
B.  Flag lots. Flag lots shall be avoided. In no circumstances shall the stem of the parcel exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet. 
C.  Lot size. Lot sizes shall conform to each of the following:

For a single-family lot, the minimum building area is two thousand (2,000) square feet configured to accommodate a building footprint of one thousand three hundred (1,300) square feet. Lots not intended for building purposes shall be so noted on the face of the plat along with the intended use. 
(Ord. No. 3102, § 3(Attach. A), 3-5-2013) 
17.24.120 - Blocks. 
A.  Generally. Blocks shall be designed to: 
1.  Create street continuity and an interconnected street network, 
2.  Foster bicycle and pedestrian travel, 
3.  Assure traffic safety, 
4.  Accommodate the special needs of the use contemplated, and 
5.  Take advantage of the opportunities or constraints posed by topography or natural features. 
B.  Single- and double-tier blocks. Blocks with one (1) tier of lots may be located on the perimeter of the subdivision or within the interior of the subdivision when the lots front on a green space or similar feature. Elsewhere, blocks shall consist of two (2) tiers of lots. 
C.  Block dimensions. A double-tier block shall not be longer than one thousand three hundred (1,300) feet or less than three hundred (300) feet, except where necessary due to topography or other natural feature. The length of a single-tier block on the perimeter of the subdivision shall conform to the standards of a double-tier block, except when the street network from a previously developed area cannot be carried over into the proposed subdivision or when a street from the proposed subdivision can not be carried over into the abutting vacant land due to topography and other similar factors. When a single-tier block fronts on a linear green space that is narrower than three (3) times the average width of the lots in the block, the block length shall not exceed one thousand six hundred (1,600) linear feet. There is no limitation on the length of a single-tier block fronting on a non-linear green space (e.g., park, open space). 
D.  Mid-block pedestrian crossing. If the length of a double-tier block exceeds nine hundred (900) feet (as allowed by this part), a mid-block pedestrian sidewalk within an easement or public right-of-way may be provided. Other mid-block pedestrian sidewalks may be required to provide pedestrian access to public amenities, commercial or employment centers, or other pedestrian-oriented areas. Mid-block pedestrian sidewalks shall be well-lit to provide visibility. 
17.24.130 - Improvements. 
A.  Generally. The subdivider shall provide all infrastructure (on-site and off-site) necessary to serve the subdivision prior to filing of the final plat or enter into an improvement agreement consistent with the provisions of Chapter 68 of this Title. Examples of infrastructure include streets, bridges, alleys, sidewalks, street lights, traffic control signs and other devices, stormwater facilities, water and sewer facilities, telephone lines, natural gas lines, and off-street mail delivery facilities. All off-site improvements shall be directly attributable to the project (76-3-510, MCA).

The undersigned grants those duly licensed persons providing or offering to provide telephone, electric power, natural gas, cable television, water and sewer service, or other similar service, the right to the joint use of the utility easements shown on this plat for the construction, maintenance, repair, or removal of their lines and other facilities upon advance notice to the affected landowners and consistent with requirements as may be imposed by the City of Great Falls now or in the future. 
17.24.150 - Ditch easements. 
A.  The subdivider shall establish ditch easements in the subdivision, in locations of appropriate topographic characteristics and sufficient width, to allow the physical placement and unobstructed maintenance of open ditches or belowground pipelines for the delivery of water for irrigation to persons and lands legally entitled to water under an appropriated water right or permit of an irrigation district or other private or public entity formed to provide for the use of water on the subdivision lots. Establishment of easements is not required if: 
1.  The average lot size is less than one (1) acre or less and the subdivider provides for disclosure, in a manner acceptable to the City Commission, that adequately notifies potential buyers of lots that are classified as irrigated land and may continue to be assessed for irrigation water delivery even though the water may not be deliverable (See: 76-3-504(i)(i), MCA); or 
2.  The water rights are removed or the process has been initiated to remove the water rights from the subdivided land through an appropriate legal or administrative process and if the removal or intended removal is denoted on the preliminary plat. If removal of water rights is not complete upon filing of the final plat, the subdivider shall provide written notification to prospective buyers of the intent to remove the water right and shall document that intent, when applicable, in agreements and legal documents for related sales transactions. (See: 76-3-504(i)(ii), MCA) 
B.  The subdivider shall, unless otherwise provided for under separate written agreement or filed easement, file and record ditch easements for unobstructed use and maintenance of existing water delivery ditches, pipelines, and facilities in the subdivision that are necessary to convey water through the subdivision to lands adjacent to or beyond the subdivision boundaries in quantities and in a manner that are consistent with historic and legal rights. (See: 76-3-504(k), MCA) 
17.24.160 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3056, § 1, adopted August 17, 2010, repealed § 17.24.160, which pertained to street maintenance agreement. See also the Code Comparative Table.

Exhibit 28-1. Standards and guidelines for specified projects and buildings 
Applicability New 
Construction Expansion Exterior 
Renovation Guideline Standard x x 1.  Relationship to site conditions. The placement and massing of the building should positively address the natural terrain of the site and how the building will be viewed from outside the site, its relationship and proximity to adjoining buildings, and how the building will be viewed from outside the site from all directions. x x 2.  Building placement. Buildings should be located to: (1) take advantage of the site's natural topography and drainage, existing vegetation, and other natural features; (2) maximize natural surveillance and visibility, (3) enhance the character of the surrounding area; and (4) facilitate pedestrian access and circulation. x x 3.  Solar exposure. Buildings should be located to take advantage of passive solar efficiencies whenever possible. (See Exhibit 28-2) x x 4.  Building shadows. Buildings should be sited and designed to minimize the impacts of shadows on residences, common areas, public spaces, and pedestrian facilities. x x x 5.  Views. Whenever possible, buildings should be sited to take advantage of viewsheds. In addition, the obstruction of view-corridors from public rights-of-ways should be avoided. (See Exhibit 28-3) x x x 6.  Northerly exposure. In new construction, entrances, drainage facilities, drive-through facilities, etc., should be located on east, west, or south side of a building. Whenever it is absolutely necessary to locate such facilities on a building's north side, corrective measures should be taken to mitigate hazardous accumulations of snow and ice. x x 7.  Relation of façade to front lot line. At least 50 percent of the front façade of any building facing the street should be located as close to the front lot line as allowed by the underlying zoning district. (Need to verify applicability to the zoning districts) x x x x 8.  Compatibility of exterior materials and finishes with surrounding buildings. Exterior materials should be compatible with those of surrounding buildings. x x x x 9.  Consistent use of exterior materials and finishes. Exterior materials and the appearance of rear and side facades should be similar to and compatible with the front façade. x x x x 10. Use of certain exterior materials prohibited. Plain face concrete block may be used as an exterior treatment provided it is not readily visible from a public street or from a residential district. No more than 20 percent of the wall area may be plain face concrete block. x x x 11. Orientation of primary entry. The building's primary entrance should face the public street rather than the interior or rear of the site. x x x 12. Design of primary entry. Primary entrances to buildings should be emphasized with a larger door or "framing" devices (e.g., deep overhangs, recesses, porches, arches, arcades, etc.) or other architectural treatment. x x x 13. Building service areas. Building service areas should be conveniently located and accessible for normal service and maintenance needs. Approaches to such facilities should be adequately engineered for convenient access. x x x 14. Joint and cross-access. Similar, complimentary, and adjacent land uses should provide cross-access between properties and joint access to arterials adjacent to the property. (See Exhibit 28-4) x x x x 15. Consistent architectural standards. Architectural standards within a project should be applied consistently on sides of buildings visible from public rights-of-way and/or adjacent residential zones. x x x x 16. Visual interest and appeal. Architectural design should create visual interest. x x x x 17. Window tinting. Windows on the first floor should be clear or lightly tinted to allow views into the building x x x x 18. Façade design. Use of different textures, complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes to produce attractive facades should be used. Use of a single color, minimal detailing, and blank walls is discouraged. x x x 19. Building mass. The mass of the proposed building should be compatible with those of surrounding buildings. Potential approaches to reduce the apparent mass include dividing the building mass into smaller sections with the use of vertical and horizontal offsets. x x x x 20. Choice of exterior materials. All exterior materials should be sufficiently durable to insure stability, maintainability, and long life. Natural materials, conveying permanence, such as stone, masonry, beveled wood siding are preferred. x x x x 21. Glare. Reflective surfaces that produce hazardous glares should not be used. x x x x 22. Colors. Development projects involving a large number of buildings should vary the architecture to create visual interest, as well as deter the monotony of identical treatments. One common and effective way to do this is to vary the use of exterior colors. This does not mean that groups of buildings need to drastically vary in color. Rather, to vary wall and trim colors in the same "family" of colors, versus use of identical colors for a substantial number of buildings. x x x 23. Mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment shall be screened with material compatible with that used architecturally in the structure. The most desirable treatment is where such screening is used as an element of the building design and is consequently made a part of the architecture of the building. x x x 24. Signage. Signs should consist of materials and colors that are similar to and compliment the primary structure. Lettering should be consistent throughout the entire project x x x 25. Minimum proportion of doors and windows. At least 30 percent of the first floor façade facing a public street should consist of windows and doors. Windows should be distributed in a more or less even manner. x x x 26. Large building elevations. When the front elevation of a building is more than 750 square feet in area, the elevation should be divided into distinct planes of 500 square feet or less. This division can occur using various means. The following design features can be used to meet this provision: (1) fascias; (2) canopies and awnings; (3) arcades; (4) functional porches at least 6 feet wide with a roof; (5) bay windows at least 3 feet wide and protruding at least 18 inches from the wall that extends from the top of building foundation to the eave; (6) vertical offsets at least 2 feet wide; and (7) other multidimensional design features. x x x x 27. Outdoor lighting. Outdoor lighting shall be consistent with chapter 40 of this Title and as recommended by the Design Review Board. x x x x 28. Landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided consistent with chapter 44 of this Title and as recommended by the Design Review Board. x x x 29. Exterior storage of materials. Exterior storage of materials in an M-2 zoning district shall be attractively screened. (Ord. 2950, 2007)  
Chapter 32 - TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES 
Sections: 

17.32.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  A well-developed and well-maintained street system is needed to provide proper access to property and efficient traffic circulation. 
2.  Streets serve two (2) competing functions: property access and movement of goods and people. When the number of accesses onto a high-traffic street increases, traffic efficiency declines and safety is jeopardized. 
3.  The function of a street, number of lots served, traffic level, requirements of emergency services, and driver expectations should dictate the street standards in terms of surface width, right-of-way width, maximum grade, and so on. For example, a high-traffic street should be built to a higher standard than a street that serves a few residential lots. 
4.  An interconnected street system is preferable to a street system where cul-de-sacs are used extensively. 
5.  Streets are an important factor in community and subdivision design. Improperly designed streets and intersections can negatively affect the safety and efficiency of public streets, create unnecessary maintenance costs, limit a parcel's development potential, and limit a project's desirability. 
6.  Excessive street standards that do not further the public health, safety, and welfare are unnecessary and add to development costs. 
7.  Traffic control devices at high-traffic locations are needed to ensure efficient and safe vehicular and pedestrian movement. 
8.  The advantages of a single access point to a major residential project (greater sense of security and elimination of through-traffic) are outweighed by the advantages of multiple access points, which include reduced internal congestion and diffusion of the development's full traffic impact to the external public street system. 
9.  Street intersections are points of conflict and potential hazard. Street intersections should be designed to afford drivers complete and unobstructed view of approaching traffic to enable them to safely enter or cross the traffic flow. 
10.  Traffic calming techniques, when properly designed, can be used to enhance safety. 
17.32.020 - Purpose. 
This chapter is established to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes: 
1.  Establish a hierarchy of street types with corresponding development standards. 
2.  Optimize efficient traffic movement. 
3.  Optimize traffic safety. 
4.  Ensure legal access to all parcels of land. 
5.  Minimize adverse environmental impacts from street development. 
6.  Create functional and attractive developments that will be an asset to the community. 
7.  Reduce the number of conflict points between pedestrians and vehicles. 
8.  Ensure that all streets accommodate the requirements of emergency vehicles for ingress and egress. 
9.  Establish standards to ensure adequate sight distances at street intersections so that motorists at an intersection are able to see approaching traffic and allow them to safely enter or cross the traffic flow. 
10.  Minimize the surface area of streets, thereby reducing stormwater runoff and increasing groundwater infiltration. 
17.32.030 - Street classification. 
A.  Street types. All existing and proposed streets in the City shall be classified as one (1) of the following: 
1.  Principal arterial. 
2.  Minor arterial. 
3.  Collector. 
4.  Local. 
B.  Classification of existing streets. Existing streets are classified as documented in the "Great Falls Area Transportation Plan", as may be amended from time to time. 
C.  Classification of proposed streets. Proposed streets shall be classified based on function, anticipated traffic speed, and average daily traffic (ADT). The estimates for ADT shall be based on trip generation rates from the most current edition of "Trip Generation" (published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers). Trip generation rates from other sources may be used if it can be shown that the alternative source better reflects local conditions. 
(Ord. No. 3056, 2010) 
17.32.040 - Improvements constructed at developer's expense. 
The developer shall provide streets and associated improvements consistent with this chapter. 
17.32.050 - Timing of improvements. 
Improvements required by this chapter shall be completed according to the schedule in Chapter 68 of this Title. 
17.32.060 - Traffic impact analysis. 
A.  When required. A traffic impact analysis shall be prepared when the peak hour traffic of the proposed development at build-out exceeds three hundred (300) trip ends. When the peak hour traffic is between two hundred (200) and two hundred ninety-nine (299) trip ends, the City may require a traffic impact analysis when circumstances warrant such review. 
B.  Preparation. When a traffic impact analysis is required, the applicant shall hire an engineer as approved by the City. The approved engineer shall have expertise in transportation planning. 
C.  Trip generation rates. Trip generation rates for various land uses shall be based on the manual entitled "Trip Generation" (latest edition) published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. Trip generation rates from other sources may be used if it can be shown that the alternative source better reflects local conditions. 
D.  Form and content. The traffic impact analysis shall be in written form along with supporting maps and other information as appropriate. At a minimum, the report shall include the following elements: 
1.  Existing traffic circulation conditions and patterns. 
2.  Anticipated traffic circulation conditions and patterns. 
3.  Effects of the project on the street network. 
4.  Recommendations/alternatives to alleviate negative effects. 
17.32.070 - Facility design requirements. 
A.  Qualifications. All transportation facilities that may be required in this chapter shall be designed by and constructed under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
B.  Approval required prior to construction. Prior to construction, the registered professional engineer shall submit a complete set of plans and specifications for the project to the City Engineer for review and approval. 
C.  As-built drawings. A registered professional engineer shall submit a set of as-built drawings to the City Engineer within four (4) months following completion of the work. 
17.32.080 - Street layout considerations. 
A.  Consistency with growth policy and others. All new streets shall be consistent with the City's adopted growth policy, the document entitled the "Great Falls Area Transportation Plan", and neighborhood plans that may be adopted, all of which may be amended from time to time. 
B.  Avoidance of environmentally sensitive areas. Streets shall be laid out to avoid environmentally sensitive areas, such as wetlands. 
C.  Through traffic. Streets shall be laid out to encourage inter-neighborhood travel but discourage unrelated through travel and speeding. 
D.  Coordination with adjoining parcels. Streets in a new development shall be connected to right-of-way in adjacent areas to allow for inter-neighborhood traffic flow. If adjacent lands are unplatted, stub outs in the new development shall be provided for future connection to the adjacent unplatted land. When topographic or other conditions make such continuation undesirable, and/or impractical, the Director of the Planning and Community Development Department, in consultation with the City Engineer, may waive or modify this requirement. 
E.  River crossings. Where a street crosses a river or stream, the street shall intersect the waterbody at right angles, except where impracticable due to environmental damage, excessive construction costs, and other factors. 
F.  Divided streets. The City Engineer may permit and may require divided streets to protect environmental features. For divided streets, the design standards shall be applied to the aggregate dimensions of the two (2) segments. 
(Ord. No. 3056, 2010) 
17.32.090 - Street design standards. 
A.  Guardrails. In areas of excessive fill or steep back slopes, roadside guardrail shall be installed consistent with the standards in the latest version of "Roadside Design Guide" as published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
B.  Pavement design. A pavement design report shall be prepared for all street projects by a registered professional engineer, or other qualified professional approved by the City Engineer, and submitted to the City Engineer for review and approval. The design shall be based on site characteristics (e.g., soils) and based on at least a twenty-year performance period traffic volume; however, the minimum design lane equivalent eighteen thousand (18,000) pound single axle load (ESAL) used in the pavement design must not be less than fifty thousand (50,000) ESAL. Pavement thickness shall be consistent with the standards contained in the current AASHTO "Guide for Design of Pavement Structures" or the current Asphalt Institute Manual Series No. 1 (MS-1). 
C.  Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall meet the standards in Exhibit 32-1. When these standards can not be met because of steep terrain, limited right-of-way, or other site constraint, a geotechnical report shall be prepared by a professional engineer and submitted to the City Engineer for review and approval. The geotechnical report shall contain, at a minimum, the following: 
1.  An explanation of why the standards can not be met. 
2.  A description of the soil types encountered at the site and their properties. 
3.  An assessment of soil slope stability. 
4.  A copy of any boring logs, if any were taken. 
5.  A description of the recommended design, supported by design calculations. 
If other slope stabilization measures are necessary (e.g., soil pinning, retaining walls), the geotechnical report shall also include the following information: 
1.  Settlement characteristics of the soil, including amount of settlement expected, time rate of settlement, surcharge or camber if required. 
2.  Bearing capacity of the soil. 
3.  Expected skin friction of the soil if piles or drilled shafts are proposed. 
4.  Soil pressure, stability, and alternates (if a soil retaining wall is being considered). 
D.  Culs-de-sac. Culs-de-sac must meet a forty-two and one-half (421/2) foot radius from center of cul-de-sac to back of curb, a fifty-five (55) foot radius on the right-of-way, and cannot be longer than five hundred (500) feet.

B.  Easement required. The common driveway shall be located within an easement which shall be recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder. The easement shall run with the land and can only be terminated by written agreement of all of the affected property owners. 
17.32.150 - Driveways. 
A.  Generally. Prior to the installation of a driveway curb cut or other access point onto a public street or right-of-way, the developer or owner shall obtain approval from the City, and if applicable, the Montana Department of Transportation or Cascade County. The City Engineer may require site driveway plans prior to approval and the start of construction on any driveway accessing any public street or right-of-way within the City, and may deny, limit, or modify access. 
B.  Width and Surfacing. Curb cuts shall not be wider than the widths listed in Exhibit 32-3. For single-family and duplex uses, the width of curb cuts shall conform to the standards listed in Exhibit 32-3 or the following, whichever is more restrictive: 
1.  For lots less than sixty-one (61) feet in width of frontage, the cumulative width of curb cuts shall not be more than thirty (30) percent of the lot frontage width. 
2.  For lots sixty-one (61) feet or greater width of frontage, the cumulative width of curb cuts shall not be more than thirty-five (35) percent of the lot frontage width. 
3.  For commercial and industrial zoning districts where commercial trucking or transportation is a significant use, driveway width may exceed widths listed in Exhibit 32-3 with approval of the City Engineer. If approved, boulevard landscaped area used for the additional driveway width shall be relocated elsewhere upon the private property. 
4.  Driveway width shall not be wider than the curb cut bottom width (excluding driveway wings) for the entire length of the driveway. Exception: For single-family and two-family residential uses, driveways accessing a street may taper to be wider than the curb cut width at the street in order to accommodate vehicle parking needs. This allowance is subject to the following restrictions: 
a.  Maximum Additional Width - The additional width of the driveway to accommodate vehicle parking may not be more than ten (10) feet greater than the curb cut bottom width (excluding driveway wings). The combined driveway and associated parking area shall be limited to no more than forty (40) total feet, measured parallel to the residential structure's frontage, and not be located in front of the living area of the structure. See Exhibit 32-4. 
b.  Surfacing - The associated parking area shall be surfaced and maintained with Portland cement concrete, asphaltic concrete, pavers, or gravel conforming to the standards prescribed by the City Engineer. The main driveway area must be paved except noted in 17.32.150(B)(4)(d) and 17.32.150 (G). 
c.  Alley Accessed Lots - For those properties which are served by an alley, no new driveways or expansions of existing driveways accessing the street are allowed unless authorized by both the City Engineer and the Director of Planning and Community Development. A driveway accessing an alley is allowed. Such driveway and associated parking area shall be surfaced and maintained with Portland cement concrete, asphaltic concrete, pavers, or gravel conforming to the standards prescribed by the City Engineer. The combined driveway and associated parking area shall be limited to no greater than nine hundred (900) square feet. See Exhibit 32-5. For lots that are one (1) acre or larger, the area of the combined driveway and associated parking area may not exceed six percent (6%) of the gross lot area. 
d.  Unpaved Streets. Where a property abuts an unpaved street, a gravel driveway and associated parking area otherwise conforming to the chapter may be installed directly off the unpaved street. 
e.  Separation for Sidewalk and Street Boulevard - For properties that do not contain sidewalks or have a sidewalk connected to the curb, associated parking areas shall not encroach beyond the front property line into the street boulevard. See Exhibit 32-4a. For properties where the sidewalk is separated from curb, the associated parking area shall only connect at a point where the driveway intersects the sidewalk. The remaining associated parking area must be set back from the sidewalk as shown in Exhibit 32-4b. 
f.  Gravel Driveway and Parking Area Maintenance - All gravel driveways and associated parking areas shall be maintained to ensure that they do not become rutted, contain standing water, or contain noxious or nuisance weeds. Gravel shall not be tracked, erode, nor spill over any paved driveway or onto any public sidewalk, path, paved street, or adjacent property.

Chapter 36 - PARKING 
Articles: 
Article 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Sections: 

17.36.1.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  The design of parking areas is critically important to the economic viability of commercial areas, pedestrian and driver safety, the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets, and community image and livability. 
2.  Standards are needed to establish the minimum and maximum number of parking spaces that are needed to serve various land uses. 
3.  Excessive parking lots reduce density, increase the cost of development, create an unhealthy built environment, contribute to the heat island effect associated with urban areas, and decrease the infiltration of stormwater into the ground. 
4.  Special standards are needed to accommodate the needs of the disabled. 
5.  A growing number of people use or would like to use bicycles for recreation, commuting, and general transportation. 
6.  Inadequate bicycle parking facilities and fear of theft are major deterrents to bicycle transportation. 
7.  Shared parking can reduce parking facility costs (including aesthetic and environmental impacts), allows greater flexibility in facility location and site design, and encourages more efficient land use. 
8.  Parking lots and their access represent a vital connection between the local transportation network and land development. 
9.  Incorrectly designed parking lots and site access have negative impacts on the site itself, the adjacent and nearby public roadways and the image of the business district, river corridor, and the City. 
17.36.1.020 - Purpose. 
This chapter is established to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes: 
1.  Increase the safety and capacity of public streets by requiring off-street parking or off-street loading facilities. 
2.  Minimize adverse effects of off-street parking and off-street loading facilities on adjacent properties and surrounding neighborhoods through the requirement of design and maintenance standards. 
3.  Lessen congestion and prevent the overtaxing of public streets by regulating the location and capacity of accessory off-street parking or off-street loading facilities. 
4.  Maintain and enhance a safe and efficient transportation system. 
5.  Provide adequate and safe facilities for the storage of bicycles. 
17.36.1.030 - Applicability.

Chapter 54 - AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

17.54.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  The runway protection zone is entirely located on the property under control of the Great Falls International Airport (GFIA). 
2.  Based on statistics compiled by the National Transportation Safety Board, the majority of aircraft accidents occur at airports or in the immediate area of the extended centerline of the runway. 
3.  Given the increased level of risk associated with landings and takeoffs, it is important to protect the approach and departure ends of each runway. 
4.  Some types of land uses can be located near airports because they are compatible with the proper functioning and continued operation of airports, while others are not. Examples of incompatible land uses include tall structures and buildings, residential, places of public assembly, and uses that cause electronic interference, glare, smoke emissions, or dust, or that attract birds and wildlife. 
5.  Some types of buildings can be designed to reduce the effects of airport-related noise on its occupants, while others cannot. 
6.  Inappropriate development near airports increases the perceived impact of aircraft noise. 
7.  Uncontrolled growth and development around airports present a clear threat to the safety of those in aircraft and those on the ground. 
8.  The State has authorized the City to adopt regulations regarding the height of structures and uses of land around airports. 
9.  In developing the regulations contained in this chapter, the following factors were considered: the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain within the area, the character of surrounding land uses, and the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and adaptable 
10.  In developing the noise regulations contained in this chapter, the following factors were considered: the safety of airport users and persons and property in the vicinity of the airport; the character of the flying operations conducted or expected to be conducted at the airport; the magnitude and duration of noise produced by aircraft and the number of aircraft flybys; the nature of the terrain; the future development of the airport; and the views and mandates of the federal agency charged with fostering of civil aeronautics as to the aerial surfaces necessary for flying operations. 
17.54.020 - Purpose. 
This chapter is established to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes: 
1.  Minimize the conflicts between airport operations and surrounding land uses by imposing limitations on the height of structures and objects of natural growth and land use. 
2.  Ensure that people buying property near the airport are aware of the potential noise levels and risks associated with the continued operation of the airport.

Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Ch. 56 pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Article 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Sections: 

17.56.1.010 - Floodplain Hazard Management Regulations. 
These regulations are known and may be cited as the "Floodplain Hazard Management Regulations." 
(Ord. No. 3102, § 3(Attach. A), 3-5-2013) 
17.56.1.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  Delineation and designation. Flood hazard areas specifically adopted herein as regulated flood hazard areas have been delineated and designated by the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) and/or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) pursuant to 76-5-201, MCA. 
B.  State and Federal approval. The proposed regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to meet the prescribed minimum standard for development and procedures. 
(Ord. No. 3102, § 3(Attach. A), 3-5-2013) 
17.56.1.030 - Purpose. 
These regulations promote public health, safety and general welfare of the residents and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in regulated flood hazard areas. These regulations are intended to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business and public service interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood disruptions; and, 
7.  Ensure compliance with the minimum standards for the continued participation in the National Flood Insurance Program for the benefit of the residents. 
(Ord. No. 3102, § 3(Attach. A), 3-5-2013) 
17.56.1.040 - Methods to reduce losses. 
These regulations are intended to reduce flood losses through the following methods: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or that may cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses of land vulnerable to floods, including public facilities, be developed or constructed to at least minimum standards or to otherwise minimize flood damage; 
3.  Regulate the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are needed to accommodate floodwaters; 
4.  Regulate filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will impact other land, flood water depth or velocity of floodwaters; 
6.  Distinguish between the land use regulations applied to the floodway within the regulated flood hazard area and those applied to that portion of the regulated flood hazard area not contained in the floodway; 
7.  Apply more restrictive land use regulations within the floodway of the regulated flood hazard area; and, 
8.  Ensure that regulations and minimum standards balance the greatest public good with the least private injury. 
(Ord. No. 3102, § 3(Attach. A), 3-5-2013) 
17.56.1.050 - Jurisdictional area. 
A.  Applicability. These regulations apply only to the flood hazard areas specifically adopted herein as regulated flood hazard areas and are more fully and specifically described in Article 4 of this chapter. The requirements and approvals for alterations to the specific jurisdictional area are also included in Article 4 of this chapter. Areas within the regulated flood hazard area also include areas specifically identified, labeled and illustrated on maps as floodway, or flood fringe that have differing uses allowed and minimum building standards that apply. The jurisdictional areas are those areas of the 100-year floodplain illustrated and depicted in the referenced studies and maps. 
B.  Study and maps. The regulated flood hazard area supporting study and maps illustrating the regulatory area are generally studies and maps completed for the DNRC by FEMA or the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) that have been adopted by DNRC pursuant to 76-5-201, MCA, et seq. The regulated flood hazard area may include those areas collectively identified as special flood hazard areas by FEMA on flood insurance rate maps and are those areas subject to flood hazard caused by the 100-year flood. FEMA also utilizes the maps of special flood hazard areas and accompanying flood insurance studies for determining flood risk for National Flood Insurance premiums. The maps and accompanying study becomes the regulatory flood hazard area only when formally adopted by DNRC and community within an ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 3102, § 3(Attach. A), 3-5-2013) 
17.56.1.060 - Floodplain Administrator.

B.  Special considerations for variance approval. 
1.  If the new construction or substantial improvements on a lot of one-half (1/2) acres or less is contiguous to and surrounded by lots of existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, a variance may be approved. However, as lot sizes increase beyond one-half (1/2) acre additional technical justification may be required; and 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum relief necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

Chapter 57 - SOUTHSIDE BUSINESS OVERLAY DISTRICT 
Sections: 

17.57.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  Historic structures on the southern periphery of the central business core represent a unique set of buildings with a long history of a mixture of commercial uses, many of which focused on light industrial and warehousing. 
2.  Most light industrial and storage uses are currently prohibited on most of the properties in this overlay district. 
3.  While adaptive reuses of the buildings may occur over time, it is desirable to ensure continued occupancy as a necessity to the health of the commercial area and nearby central business core through creation of an overlay district to allow certain light industrial and warehousing uses in existing buildings. 
(Ord. No. 3087, § 1(Exh. A), 6-19-2012, eff. 7-19-2012) 
17.57.020 - Purpose.

17.64.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  Within the districts established by this title, or within districts established or changed by future amendment, there may exist uses and signs which were lawful before the adoption of this title, or amendment, but which are nonconforming under the provisions of this title or amendment thereto. 
2.  It is reasonable to generally allow, but not encourage, nonconformities to continue until such time as they are moved, removed or discontinued. 
(Ord. 2950, 2007) 
3.  Nonconformities that are moved, removed, discontinued, changed, extended, or enlarged shall be made to conform with the regulations that apply to all other parcels of land within the district. However, changes in use may be allowed under certain circumstances. 
(Ord. 2950, 2007) 
4.  It is reasonable to allow a nonconforming use to resume in certain circumstances if the structure in which it takes place is only partially damaged or destroyed. 
17.64.020 - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  Generally. A nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  Change or expansion of nonresidential uses. 
a.  A nonconforming nonresidential use may be changed to another nonconforming nonresidential use, or may be increased or expanded, if the Planning and Community Development Director determines the application for the proposed, expanded or increased use meets the following criteria, without requiring or requesting any dimensional, lighting, parking, landscaping or other similar variance: 
i.  The off-street parking and loading requirements for and traffic generated by the proposed, expanded or increased use do not exceed that of the existing or most recent use. 
ii.  The proposed use is permitted in the same zoning district in which the existing or most recent use is first permitted in Table 20-1 of Chapter 20 to this Title. For the purposes of this Chapter, "first permitted" shall mean the first zoning district in Table 20-1 in which a "P" occurs, when reading the table from left to right. 
iii.  The intensity of onsite and offsite impacts from noise, dust, smoke and other environmental impacts associated with the proposed, expanded or increased use is equal to or less than that associated with the existing or most recent use. 
Such application may require a fee, as may be established by the City Commission. (Ord. 2950, 2007) 
b.  Alternatively, a nonconforming, nonresidential use may also be changed to another nonconforming use, or may be increased or expanded, through a conditional use permit procedure as set forth in Chapter 16. 
2.  Expansion of residential uses. The expansion of nonconforming residential dwellings is allowed, in compliance with applicable building codes, up to twenty (20) percent of the existing total residential area, as long as the number of dwelling units on the lot is not increased. 
3.  Change of location. A nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or to another structure than what was occupied at the effective date of this title or any amendment thereto which creates said nonconforming use. 
4.  Discontinuance of use. If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for more than twenty-four (24) months, any subsequent use shall conform with this Title. 
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 8-17-2010; Ord. No. 3087, § 1(Exh. A), 6-19-2012, eff. 7-19-2012) 
17.64.030 - Nonconforming structures. 
A.  Generally. A nonconforming structure may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  Change in extent. A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in a way to increase its nonconformity. 
2.  Conformance required if moved. If a nonconforming structure is moved for any reason for any distance, it shall thereafter conform with this Title. 
3.  A nonconforming structure that is removed, razed or damaged by fire or other cause shall be rebuilt in conformance with this Title to the maximum extent feasible. If it is determined that it is not feasible for the structure to be rebuilt in conformance with this title the structure may be rebuilt on the structure's original foundation or on a new foundation in the same location. Construction must be completed within twenty-four (24) months of the date of such damage, removal or razing. If repair or rehabilitation does not occur within twenty-four (24) months, the structure shall be reconstructed only in conformance with this Title without resort to variance. 
B.  Unsafe conditions, ordinary maintenance, and remodeling. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof, ordinary repair and maintenance, or remodeling.

Chapter 68 - TIMING OF IMPROVEMENTS, IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENTS, AND DEDICATIONS 
Sections: 


17.68.010 - Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  Required improvements installed in a timely manner protect the public health, safety, and welfare. 
2.  There may be instances where the installation of all required improvements is not possible, or desirable, prior to commencing construction of buildings. 
3.  To minimize the risk that the City would have to use public funds to install the required improvements subject to an improvement agreement, the amount of the financial security should be greater than the estimated installation cost to account for the administration of the agreement, pricing uncertainties, product availability, inflation, and other similar factors that may exist during the life of the agreement. 
17.68.020 - Purpose. 
This chapter is established to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and is intended to accomplish the following purposes: 
1.  Ensure that the improvements needed to accommodate development projects are provided in a timely manner. 
2.  Ensure that land dedicated to the City is suitable and acceptable for the intended purpose. 
17.68.030 - Timing of improvements. 
A.  Generally. Improvements shall be installed consistent with the schedule shown in Exhibit 68-1. For some of the improvements, it is possible to enter into an improvement agreement with the City consistent with this chapter.

B.  Uses not listed. For improvements not listed, improvement agreements may be used at the City's discretion. 
C.  Exceptions. The City shall not enter into an improvement agreement when a delay in the completion of the improvement could present a tangible danger or hazard. In addition, the City may limit the number, type, and scope of improvements subject to the agreement and subsequent agreements. 
(Ord. 2950, 2007) 
17.68.040 - Improvement agreements. 
A.  City Attorney approval. The improvement agreement and form of financial security shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney. 
B.  Amount of security. The amount of the financial security shall be the total cost of the improvements subject to the agreement, as estimated by a registered professional engineer, or other qualified professional as appropriate, plus thirty-five (35) percent. The City Engineer may require the developer to submit a second cost estimate from another source to verify the cost of the improvements. 
C.  Content. An improvement agreement shall contain the following: 
1.  A list of all on-site and off-site improvements subject to the agreement. 
2.  Detailed construction plans and cost estimates for the improvements subject to the agreement.

3.  A timetable for completing each of the improvements subject to the agreement. 
4.  A description of the type of financial security used to secure the completion of the improvements subject to the agreement. 
5.  A provision allowing the City to claim the financial security when the developer has not satisfactorily completed the improvements by the date specified in the agreement or has not otherwise complied with the terms of the agreement. 
6.  The financial security shall be released in full only upon submission of as-built plans when required and written certification by a registered professional engineer, or other qualified professional, that the improvements have been installed in accordance with the development approval and other applicable provisions of this Title. 
7.  A provision stating that the City may release a portion of the financial security in an amount equal to one hundred thirty-five (135) percent of the estimated cost of the improvement that has been satisfactorily completed. 
8.  A provision that the developer indemnifies, defends, and holds the City, its employees, agents and assigns harmless from and against any and all liabilities, loss, claims, causes of action, judgements and damages resulting from or arising out of the execution of the improvement agreement. 
9.  A provision stating that if the developer has not satisfactorily completed the improvements by the date specified in the agreement, the City can use a portion of the security as reimbursement for time and expense in administering the installation and inspection of the improvements subject to the agreement, 
10.  A provision stating that the City Engineer must inspect the improvements to verify compliance with the development approval and this Title before releasing the financial security, in whole or part. 
11.  The term of the agreement. 
12.  A provision allowing amendment with the written consent of all parties, provided the minimum requirements of this Title are satisfied. 
13.  Any other provision deemed appropriate by the City to accomplish the purposes of this Title and to protect its interests. 
14.  A provision that the developer indemnifies and holds the City, its employees, agents, and assigns harmless for and against all claims, attorney fees, judgments, demands and/or liability of every kind and nature, arising out of, or attributable to soil conditions and/or groundwater associated with the property being developed. 
D.  Types of financial security. The following types of financial security may be acceptable: 
1.  Cash paid directly to the City Treasurer and held in a separate account. 
2.  As irrevocable letter of credit from an approved financial institution. 
3.  Cash escrow held by the City or an approved escrow agent and subject to an executed escrow agreement. 
4.  Bank assignment of funds. 
5.  Performance bonds, at the discretion of the City Attorney. 
(Ord. No. 3056, § 1, 8-17-2010) 
17.68.050 - Dedication of improvements. 
A.  Minimum standards. All improvements to be dedicated to the City shall meet the standards and requirements of this title, State law, and other standards and specifications the City may adopt. 
B.  As-built. Record drawings, meeting City specifications, shall be submitted for review and approval prior to acceptance. 
C.  Certification required. All improvements to be dedicated to the City shall be certified by a registered professional engineer prior to acceptance. 
D.  Lien release required. Lien releases from contractors, suppliers, and others as appropriate shall be submitted prior to acceptance. 
(Ord. 2950, 2007) 
17.68.060 - Dedication of land. 
For all land dedicated to the City, the City Commission shall affirm the dedication before it becomes effective. Prior to acceptance, the City shall ensure that all property taxes that have been levied and assessed have been paid proportionate to the amount of land being dedicated. 
17.68.070 - Dedication of parks: process. 
Residential subdivisions, which for the purposes of this section also include mixed-use subdivisions and planned unit developments that will include both residential and nonresidential uses, must comply with the park dedication requirements established by Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621. Compliance shall be determined using the following process. 
A.  Pre-Application . All pre-applications for residential subdivisions shall show one or more proposed neighborhood parks that meet the standards established here; indicate that the applicant prefers to make a cash payment in-lieu of the dedication of park land; or show, in writing, how the application is exempt for any of the reasons listed in Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621(6). 
B.  Pre-Application Review . The Director of Planning and Community Development or his designee will review the pre-application and suggest any changes to the proposed park dedication that are needed before an application is filed. The review will be based on the requirements of Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621; the standards adopted in 17.68.080 of this article; the City's parks plan; and the growth policy. 
C.  Planning Board Review . In preparing its recommendation to the City Commission on an application for a residential subdivision, the Planning Advisory Board shall include a specific determination of whether or not the proposed residential subdivision complies with the requirements of Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621; the standards adopted in 17.68.080; and the City's parks plan. 
D.  City Commission Review . In deciding whether or not to approve an application for a residential subdivision, the City Commission shall make a specific determination of whether or not the proposed residential subdivision complies with the requirements of Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621; the standards adopted in 17.68.080; and the City's parks plan. 
E.  Improvement Agreement . Where an improvement agreement is required for a residential subdivision, the draft improvement agreement presented to the Planning Advisory Board and the City Commission shall include the language necessary to provide for the dedication of the proposed park or parks (dedication may, at the City's discretion, be phased); for the payment of the fee in-lieu of dedication; or for the recording of the documents needed to demonstrate that the proposed subdivision is exempt, as provided by Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621(6). 
F.  Enforcement . No Certificate of Occupancy for any structure in a residential subdivision shall be issued until a final plat bearing a certificate of park dedication has been recorded with the Cascade County Clerk and Recorder; a payment in lieu of park dedication has been received; the documents demonstrating that the subdivision is eligible for an exemption have been recorded with the Cascade County Clerk and Recorder; or an improvement agreement providing for the phased dedication of one or more parks or phased payments in-lieu of park dedication has been executed and recorded with the Cascade County Clerk and Recorder. 
(Ord. No. 3130, § 1(Exh. A), 5-19-2015) 
17.68.080 - Dedication of parks: standards. 
A.  Basic Dedication Requirement . As provided in Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621(1), the park dedication requirement is: 
i.  Eleven percent (11%) of the area proposed to be divided into residential parcels of 1/2 acre or less; 
ii.  Seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the area proposed to be divided into residential parcels that are larger than 1/2 acre, but smaller than 1 acre; 
iii.  Five percent (5%) of the area proposed to be divided into residential parcels that are larger than 1 acre, but smaller than three (3) acres; 
iv.  Two and one-half (2.5%) of area proposed to be divided into residential parcels that are larger than three (3) acres, but five (5) acres or smaller; or 
v.  Where acceptable to the City, a cash payment of the value of the un-subdivided, unimproved land that would, otherwise, be dedicated in one or more parks. The calculation of payments in-lieu of the dedication of park land is described in 17.68.090. 
vi.  There is no park dedication requirement for subdivisions that create parcels that are larger than five (5) acres. 
vii.  For mixed-use subdivisions or planned unit developments that will include both residential and nonresidential uses, only the land that is to be developed for residential use will be used as a basis for the calculation of the area to be dedicated. 
B.  Exceptions to the Basic Dedication Requirement . Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621(6) offers exceptions to the park dedication requirement. 
i.  Private Parks. An applicant may propose to provide one or more privately developed and maintained parks that include at least as much land as would be dedicated in accord with 17.68.080.A. An applicant who wishes to use this exception must present a detailed plan for the development and use of the private park or parks, including the phasing of park development, if that is proposed, as well as a proposed mechanism for perpetual maintenance of the private parks. The applicant shall also provide a security sufficient for the completion of the private park or parks as if they were public improvements. 
ii.  Open Space. The second exception is where the applicant provides for the permanent protection of open space resources on at least as much land as would be dedicated through the gift of a conservation easement or land fee simple to an accredited land trust or to a public agency charged with the management of such resources. 
iii.  At Another Location. Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621(6) also makes it possible for an applicant to propose to provide the required park space at another location, outside the proposed residential subdivision. This will be acceptable to the City only if the park proposed outside the proposed residential subdivision complies with the standards adopted in this section and is consistent with the City's parks plan. 
C.  Distance from Another Park . A park land dedication generally will not be accepted where it is within 3/8 mile (1,980 feet) of an existing or future (already dedicated, but not developed) neighborhood park or a community or regional park that serves neighborhood park functions. Exceptions to this rule may be permitted where the dedication will add land or provide trail access to an existing park, consistent with the City's parks plan. 
D.  Distance from Homes Served . A proposed park should be within 3/8 mile of the majority of the homes it is intended to serve. It is recognized, however, that the terrain and existing land use patterns may make meeting this standard a challenge for some proposed subdivisions. If no suitable site is available within 1,980 feet, the Planning Advisory Board may recommend and the City Commission may accept a site that is within a half-mile (2,640 feet) of the majority of the homes it is intended to serve. 
E.  Accessibility . Proposed neighborhood parks must be accessible to the homes they are intended to serve by a generally continuous system of sidewalks and/or trails that do not cross arterial streets at grade. They must also have safe, adequate access via public streets along which on-street parking is permitted. This standard shall not be read to mean that a proposed neighborhood park must have street frontage on all sides. 
F.  Minimum Area . The minimum area of a proposed neighborhood park should be three (3) acres. The Planning Advisory Board may recommend and the City Commission may accept exceptions to this rule where a smaller area can be added to an existing park or will provide a trail right-of-way or another significant recreational or open space asset, and the remainder of the applicant's park land dedication obligation, if any, will be fulfilled by a payment in-lieu of dedication. 
G.  Useful Shape . While linear park and open space areas serve many useful functions, any land offered for dedication must include areas that are suitable for and large enough for the installation of typical neighborhood park facilities including playgrounds, basketball or multi-sport courts, picnic areas or shelters, and areas for informal field games like soccer or softball. 
H.  Suitable Lands . Lands offered for dedication must contain areas that are suitable for the construction or installation of typical neighborhood park facilities. This means lands that have a slope of less than four (4) percent and soils that do not impose severe limitations on the development of picnic areas or playgrounds, as shown in the Soil Survey of Cascade County Area, Montana issued by the US Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service in January 1982. 
I.  Open Space Lands . If sufficient land suitable for the development of typical neighborhood park facilities is provided, dedicated parks may also include open space lands that are not as suitable for park development, but provide community services like flood control, storm water treatment, microclimate modification, urban wildlife habitat, and/or aesthetic enjoyment. 
(Ord. No. 3130, § 1(Exh. A), 5-19-2015) 
17.68.090 - Calculation of fees in-lieu of park dedication. 
    As established in 17.68.080(A)(v), the City may accept cash payments in-lieu of the dedication of park land. The amount of the payment required will depend on the value of the land, which may be determined using either of the two methods described below. 
A.  Appraisal . The applicant may submit a current, which for this purpose means made within the past year, appraisal of the un-subdivided, unimproved land proposed for subdivision to serve as a basis for the calculation of fees to be paid in lieu of park land dedication. Such appraisals shall be prepared by an appraiser who is licensed and certified to practice in the State of Montana pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. 37-54-101, et seq. 
B.  Formula . The City Commission may, by resolution, adopt a standard formula for payments to be made in-lieu of the dedication of park land. If adopted, applicants may choose to base their payment in-lieu on this formula rather than submitting an appraisal. The adopted formula shall be reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect current land values at least every three years. 
C.  Use . The Fiscal Services Department will establish procedures by which payments accepted in-lieu of dedications are tracked and it can be shown that those payments have been expended in compliance with the requirements of this code and Mont. Code Ann. 76-3-621. 
(Ord. No. 3130, § 1(Exh. A), 5-19-2015) 
17.68.100 - Neighborhood park maintenance charges. 
    Improvement agreements for residential subdivisions, including mixed-use subdivisions and planned unit developments that will include residential uses may establish a reasonable neighborhood park maintenance charge on all residential parcels, including all residential condominium units, created. Lots used for attached dwellings that remain in one ownership will pay the required charge for each dwelling unit permitted on that lot.

Appendix E - CITY OF GREAT FALLS EVASION CRITERIA FOR LOCAL DETERMINATION OF EVASION OF THE SUBDIVISION AND PLATTING ACT 
Legislative findings. 
The City Commission makes the following findings: 
1.  The legislature, in adopting and amending the Subdivision and Platting Act, 76-3-101 et seq., MCA, (ACT) has presumed: 
a.  That parcels of land containing less than one hundred sixty (160) acres are building sites and that the creation of these parcels should be reviewed and approved by the local governing body applying the primary review criteria set forth in 76-3-608 MCA. 
b.  That the exemptions from subdivision review under 76-3-201 and 76-3-207 MCA, are intended to relieve a landowner from the requirements of local review when the division of land either creates no additional building sites or creates so few building sites that only minimal impact will likely result. 
c.  That the purpose of the exemptions is not to provide a means of creating numerous building sites without subdivision review, but rather to deal with the exceptional circumstances when subdivision review is unnecessary. 
2.  The Montana Supreme Court decisions in Florence-Carlton School District vs. Ravalli County Board of Commissioners, 1978; Leach v. Visser, 1989; and State ex rel. Dreher v. Fuller, 1993; have recognized a governing body's right to narrowly interpret and enforce the provisions of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, especially those pertaining to the use of exemptions. 
3.  The parcels of land created by exemptions often do not provide for: 
a.  The coordination of roads within the divided land or with other roads, both existing and planned. 
b.  The dedication of land for roadways and public utility easements. 
c.  The provision of adequate open spaces for travel, light, air, and recreation. 
d.  The provision of adequate transportation, water drainage, and sanitary facilities. 
e.  The avoidance of minimizing of congestion. 
f.  The avoidance of land division that would involve unnecessary environmental degradation. 
g.  The avoidance of danger or injury to health, safety, or welfare by reason of natural hazard or the lack of water, drainage, access, transportation, schools or other public services, or would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services. 
4.  The likelihood that land development problems will occur is greatly increased when building sites are created without public review and are further divided without review. 
5.  The City Commission of the City of Great Falls has established the necessary procedures for expedient review of subdivisions creating five (5) or fewer parcels and thus has diminished justification for avoiding review through use of exemptions. 
Purpose. 
To provide criteria to guide the City of Great Falls in determining when the use of an exemption from subdivision review is adopted to evade the purpose of the Subdivision and Platting Act. 
Procedures and general requirements. 
A.  Evidence of claimed exemption. Any person seeking exemption from the requirements of the Subdivision and Platting Act (76-3-101 et seq., MCA) shall submit to the Planning Department or other designated agent: 
1.  A certificate of survey or, where a survey is not required, an instrument of conveyance, and 
2.  Evidence of, and an affidavit affirming, entitlement to the claimed exemption. 
B.  Review of evidence. When a certificate of survey or instrument of conveyance is submitted, the Planning Department or other designated agent shall cause the documents to be reviewed by the Planning Department and the City Engineer. The Planning Department and the City Engineer shall review the proposed land division to determine whether it complies with the requirements set forth herein, in the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, and the Montana Sanitation in Subdivisions Act. 
C.  Written determination. After the review to evaluate compliance with the requirements contained herein, the agents shall submit a written determination whether the use of the exemption is intended to evade the purposes of the Act. 
D.  Following compliance determination. If the designated agents find that the proposed use of the exemption complies with the statutes and these criteria, they shall advise the Clerk and Recorder to file the certificate of survey or record the instrument of conveyance and accompanying documents. If the agents find the proposed use of the exemption does not comply with the statutes and these criteria, they shall advise the Clerk and Recorder to not file or record the documents and the clerk shall return the materials to the landowner. 
E.  Denial of exemption and rebuttable presumption - appeal. Any person whose proposed use of exemption has been denied by the designated agents because the use of the exemption raised a rebuttable presumption established by these guidelines may appeal the agents' decision to the City Commission of the City of Great Falls. The person may request a hearing, and may submit additional evidence to show that the use of the exemption in question is not intended to evade the Act, and, thereby overcome the rebuttable presumption. If the governing body concludes that the evidence and information overcomes the presumption that the exemption is being invoked to evade the Act, they may authorize the use of the exemption in writing. A certificate of survey claiming such an exemption from the subdivision review, which otherwise is in proper form, may be filed (or an instrument of conveyance recorded) if it is accompanied by written authorization of the governing body. If the use of an exemption is determined to be an evasion of the Act, the landowner may submit a subdivision application for the proposed land division. 
F.  Advisory Examination. Landowners or their representatives are encouraged to meet with the City's designated agents to discuss whether a proposed land division or use of an exemption is in compliance with these criteria. The agents may issue an advisory opinion only, and the opinion creates no commitment on the local officials when the documents creating the proposed land division are submitted to the local governing body. 
G.  Consideration of surrounding circumstances. The City Commission of the City of Great Falls and its agents, when determining whether an exemption is claimed for the purpose of evading the Act, shall consider all of the surrounding circumstances. These circumstances may include but are not limited to: the nature of the claimant's business, the prior history of the particular tract in question, the proposed configuration of the tracts if the proposed exempt transaction are completed, and any pattern of exempt transactions that will result in the equivalent of a subdivision without local government review (State ex rel. Dreher v. Fuller, 50 St. Rptr 454, 1993). 
H.  Development pattern equivalent to a subdivision. Exempt divisions of land that would result in a pattern of development equivalent to a subdivision shall be presumed to be adopted for purposes of evading the Act. A "pattern of development" occurs whenever three (3) or more parcels of less than one hundred sixty (160) acres with common covenants or facilities have been divided from the original tract. 
I.  Creation of non-conforming lots. The City of Great Falls will not allow to be filed any subdivision plats or certificates of survey that create lots that are not conforming to the zoning district in which those lots are located. The City of Great Falls will not allow to be filed any subdivision plats or certificates of survey that further exacerbates an existing non-conforming parcel including but not limited to reducing the sizes of existing non-conforming parcels through boundary line changes, or creating parcels in which setbacks are in violation of the City Land Development Code. 
J.  Physical access requirements. The City of Great Falls will not allow to be filed any certificates of survey where legal and physical access is not provided to each lot shown on the certificate of survey. Legal and physical access shall be at least sixty (60) feet in width to allow for access to parcels for public health, safety, and welfare concerns. If a sixty (60) foot wide access is not physically possible, the City may, upon a showing of good cause, allow for an access of less than sixty (60) feet in width. 
Pattern of development. The scope of review of a pattern of development shall apply to the creation of a parcel of land or multiple divisions of land by use of or proposed use of an exemption(s). 
A.  Original tract less than twenty (20) acres. A pattern of development occurs whenever three (3) or more parcels (i.e., two (2) exempt parcels and a remaining parcel) have been divided from the original tract of less than twenty (20) acres regardless of ownership by use of exemptions from the Act. 
B.  Original tract twenty (20) acres or more. A pattern of development occurs whenever more than four (4) parcels under twenty (20) acres (i.e., three (3) exempt parcels and a remaining parcel) have been divided from the original tract of twenty (20) acres or more, regardless of ownership, by use of exemptions from the Act. A pattern of development may be evidenced by the use of exemptions contiguous to platted lots where common roads are shared or the exempted tracts have similar shape or size to the platted lots, or the exempted tracts are being created by the same landowner who created the platted lots. 
Exemption as a gift or sale to a member of the immediate family (76-3-207(1)(b) MCA) 
A.  Statement of intent. The intention of this exemption is to allow a landowner to convey one (1) parcel to each member of the immediate family without local subdivision review. A single parcel may be conveyed to each member of the immediate family under this exemption in each County where the landowner owns property. A proposed division of land as a family transfer may be declared to be an evasion of the Act if it is determined that one (1) of the following conditions exists: 
1.  The proposed parcel would result in a pattern of development; 
2.  The division is made for the purpose of speculation by the grantor, or for resale for the benefit of the grantor by using the grantee as a "strawperson;" 
3.  The transfer is the second or subsequent family transfer to the same member of the immediate family where the first transfer occurred prior to April 7, 1993; 
4.  The name of the grantee and relationship to the grantor do not appear on the face of the proposed certificate of survey; 
5.  The grantee is also one (1) of the grantors. 
B.  Immediate family definition. The Montana Subdivision and Platting Act defines "immediate family" as the spouse, children by blood or adoption, and parents of the grantor. 
C.  Filing requirements. Filing of any certificate of survey (or recording of an instrument of conveyance) that would use this exemption to create a parcel for conveyance to a family member must show the name of the grantee, relationship to the landowner, and the parcel to be conveyed under this exemption, and the landowner's certificate of compliance. Also, the certificate of survey or instrument of conveyance shall be accompanied by a deed or other conveying document. 
D.  Family conveyance limitations. One (1) conveyance of a parcel to each member of the landowner's immediate family is eligible for exemption from subdivision review in accordance with the provisions contained herein. However, the use of this exemption may not create more than one (1) remaining parcel of less than one hundred sixty (160) acres. 
E.  Evasion determination. Any proposed use of family conveyance exemption to divide a tract that was created through use of an exemption will be presumed to be adopted for purposes of evading the Act. This presumption is in effect regardless of previous ownership of the tracts and pertains to remaining tracts of less than one hundred sixty (160) acres as well as to those tracts that were created through the exemptions. 
F.  Family conveyance and development plans. The use of the family conveyance exemption to divide tracts that were created as part of an overall development plan with such characteristics as common roads, utility easements, restrictive covenants, open space or common marketing or promotional plan shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the use of the exemption is adopted for purposes of evading the Act. 
Exemption to provide security for a construction mortgage, lien or trust indenture. See: 76-3-201(1) MCA 
A.  Statement of intent. Under policies by many lending institutions and federal home loan guaranty programs, a landowner who is buying a tract with financing or through a contract for deed is required to hold title to the specific site on which the residence will be built. The intended purpose of this exemption is to allow a landowner that is buying a tract using financing or contract for deed to segregate a smaller parcel from the tract for security for financing construction of a home on the property. 
B.  Portion of parcel excluded from mortgage. That portion of the parcel not included in the mortgage cannot be conveyed in any manner without subdivision review and approval by the governing body. This exemption is not available to simply create a parcel without review by claiming that the parcel will be used for security to finance construction of a home or other structure on the proposed lot. This exemption may not be properly invoked unless: 
1.  The claimant is purchasing a larger tract through financing or a contract for deed (and thus does not hold title); and 
2.  A lending institution requires the landowner to hold title to a smaller parcel of the tract because the smaller tract is required as a security for a building construction loan. 
C.  Submittals required. When this exemption is to be used, the landowner shall submit to the Cascade County Clerk and Recorder: 
1.  A statement of how many parcels within the original tract will be created by use of the exemption; 
2.  The deed, trust indenture, or mortgage for the exempt parcel (which states that the tract of land is created only to secure a construction mortgage, lien, or trust indenture); 
3.  a statement explaining who will have title to and possession of the balance of the original parcel after title to the exempted parcel is conveyed; and 
4.  A signed statement from a lending institution that the creation of the exempted parcel is necessary to provide security for mortgages, liens, or trust indentures for the purpose of construction, improvements to the land being divided, or refinancing purposes. 
D.  Evasion determination. The use of this exemption is presumed to have been for the purpose of evading the Act if: 
1.  It will create more than one (1) building site; 
2.  The financing is not for construction on the exempted parcel; 
3.  The person named in the statement explaining who would have possession of the remainder parcel, if title to the exempted parcel is conveyed, is anyone other than the borrower of funds for construction; 
4.  Title to the exempted parcel will not be initially obtained by the lending institution if foreclosure occurs; or, 
5.  It appears that the principal reason the parcel is being created is to create a building site and using the parcel to secure a construction loan is a secondary purpose. 
E.  Requirements and status of exempted parcel boundaries upon satisfaction of construction mortgage, lien or trust indenture. Once the loan for construction mortgage, lien or trust indenture has been satisfied, the exemption is no longer applicable and the boundaries delineating the exempt parcel are extinguished and the acreage previously identified reverts back into the acreage of the initial parcel. This will be accomplished by the filing of the warranty deed for the parent parcel when the conditions of the contract are satisfied, in the event that the parcel is being purchased in that manner. 
Exemption for agricultural purposes. See: 76-3-207(1)(c) MCA 
A.  Statement of Intent. The intention of this exemption is to allow a landowner to create a parcel without local review where the parcel will be used only for production of livestock or agricultural crops and where no residential, commercial, or industrial buildings will be built. 
B.  Agricultural purposes. For purposes of these evasion criteria, "agricultural purposes" means the use of land for raising crops or livestock, or for the preservation of open space, and specifically excludes residential structures or facilities for commercially processing agricultural products. Agricultural lands are exempt from review by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, provided the property owner properly invokes the applicable exemption. 
C.  Conditions to be met. The following conditions must be met or the use of the exemption will be presumed to have been adopted for the purposes of evading the Act: 
5.  The parties to the transaction must enter into a covenant running with the land and revocable only by mutual consent of the City Commission of the City of Great Falls and the property owner that the divided land will be used exclusively for agricultural purposes or open space. The property owner, the buyer or lessee, and the City Commission of the City of Great Falls or its designated agent must sign the covenant. 
6.  The landowner must demonstrate that the planned use of the exempted parcel is for agricultural purposes and that no residential, commercial, or industrial buildings will be constructed; for example, a statement signed by the buyer. 
7.  Any change in the use of the land for anything other than agricultural purposes subjects the parcel to review as a minor subdivision. 
8.  Residential, commercial, or industrial structures, including facilities for commercial processing of agricultural products are excluded uses on parcels created under this exemption unless the covenant is revoked. 
Relocation of common boundary. See: 76-3-207(1)(a) MCA 
A.  Statement of intent. The intended purpose of this exemption is to allow a change of the location of a boundary line between two (2) parcels and to allow a one-time transfer of a tract to effect that change in location without subdivision review. 
B.  Boundary identification requirements. Certificates of survey claiming this exemption must clearly distinguish between the existing boundary location and the new boundary. This shall be accomplished by representing the existing boundary with a dashed line and the new boundary with a solid line. The appropriate certification must be included on the certificate of survey. 
C.  Deed required. Certificate of survey showing the relocation of common boundary lines must be accompanied by a deed or from adjoining property owners for the entire newly described parcel(s) for that portion of the tract(s) that is being affected. 
D.  Additional parcel creation. If the relocation of a common boundary would result in the permanent creation of an additional parcel of land, the division of land must be reviewed as a subdivision. 
E.  Evasion determination. A proposed relocation of common boundary lines may be considered an evasion of the Act if it is determined that: 
1.  The documentation submitted does not support the stated reason for relocation; or 
2.  It creates a parcel of less than one hundred sixty (160) acres in size, which prior to the relocation had more than one hundred sixty (160) acres. 
Court Order. A certificate of survey filed citing this exemption must be accompanied by a copy of the court order (see: 76-3-201). 
Remainder Parcels. 
A.  Statement of intent. A "remainder" parcel is that part of an original tract that is left following the segregation of other parcels from the tract for the purpose of transfer. A "remainder" may not be created for the purpose of conveyance and must be retained by the owner. A "remainder" that is created by the segregation of a subdivision from a larger original tract is not part of the subdivision nor is it subject to the surveying requirements of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act (MSPA). Although the term "remainder" does not appear in the MSPA, the possibility that remainder parcels may exist is implicit in the express provisions of the MSPA (Attorney General Letter opinion to Robert McCarthy, April 22, 1987). 
B.  Evidence of remainder status required. A landowner claiming that a parcel is a "remainder" must present evidence that the parcel is in fact intended to be retained and is not to be transferred. Examples of such evidence include the existence of the landowner's residence on the parcel or building plans for a structure to be built by or for the landowner.
