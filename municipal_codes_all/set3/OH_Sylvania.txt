before the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Sylvania, Lucas
County, Ohio, six members elected thereto concurring:
   SECTION 1.  That the ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the

   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Sylvania was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Sylvania Codified Ordinances is indicated.

nor shall the City be annexed to any other municipality or body politic without
the consent of the City's Council and of a majority of its electors voting on
such questions at an election held and conducted in the manner provided by law.

same manner and for the same purpose as the original book, ordinances, minutes
or journal would be received. If a revision, codification or rearrangement of

affirmative vote of at least five (5) of its members, submit to the electors
any proposed amendment or amendments to this Charter; or, upon petition signed
by not less than ten percent (10%) of the electors of the City setting forth
any proposed amendment or amendments to this Charter, the Council shall submit
such proposed amendment or amendments to the electors in accordance, in each
instance, with the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Ohio now or

any proposed amendment or amendments to the electors to the extent that such

Ohio.
   If any such proposed amendment or amendments shall be approved by a majority
of the electors voting thereon, it or they shall become a part of this Charter;
except that if two or more inconsistent proposed amendments on the same subject

electors of the City. For all other purposes, the Charter shall be in effect on

behalf of or against the City or any officer thereof, or any contract entered
into by the City, or any franchise granted by the City, or any pending
proceeding for the authorization of public improvements or the levy of
assessments therefor. All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations in
force in the City when this Charter takes effect and which are not inconsistent
with the provisions of this Charter, shall continue in full force and effect
until amended or repealed.

elective office in the City shall be called into active military service during
his elective term, his office shall thereupon become vacant and it shall be
filled as provided by this Charter.  Membership in military reserve

   Any officer or member of Council of the City who shall at any time during

in this Charter shall forfeit his office and the same shall thereupon become
vacant. The forfeiture of such office shall not render void or ineffective any
action taken by such officer or member of Council in his official capacity
prior thereto.
SECTION 7.0 INTERPRETATION.
   The Article and Section headings herein have been inserted for convenience
for purposes of reference and are not intended to define or limit the scope of,
or otherwise affect, any provision of this Charter.
   In order that a ready means may be at hand for reconciling any conflicts,
resolving any inconsistencies and clarifying any obscurities, which may be
discovered in the language of this Charter, the power is hereby vested in the
Council to interpret the various sections and parts of this Charter, in harmony
with the spirit thereof, by ordinance, resolution or other measure of said
Council adopted by the affirmative vote of five (5) or more of its members.

with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)    Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action

incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)    If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC  1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.  (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.  (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history; 
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

purposes of such special meeting is given to the news media that have requested
such advance notification in accordance with subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)    News media requests for such advance notification of special meetings
shall specify:
      (1)    The municipal body that is the subject of such request;

   Any such request shall be effective for six months from the date of filing
with the Clerk or until the Clerk receives written notice from such medium
cancelling or modifying such request, whichever is earlier. Each requesting
news medium shall be informed of such period of effectiveness at the time it
files its request. Such requests may be modified or extended only by filing a
complete new request with the Clerk. A request shall not be deemed to be made
unless it is complete in all respects, and such request may be conclusively
relied on by the City, the municipal body that is the subject of such request,
and the Clerk.
   (c)    The Clerk shall give such oral notification or written notification,
or both, as the Clerk determines, to the news media that have requested such
advance notification in accordance with subsection (b) hereof, of the time,
place and purposes of each special meeting, at least twenty-four hours prior to
the time of such special meeting.
   (d)    In the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action, a
special meeting may be held without giving twenty-four hours advance
notification thereof to the requesting news media. The persons calling such

person giving such notification determines, of the time, place and purposes of
such special meeting to such news media that have requested such advance
notification in accordance with subsection (b) hereof. The minutes or the call,
or both, of any such special meeting shall state the general nature of the
emergency requiring immediate official action. (Ord. 46-76, Passed 7-19-76.)
105.06  NOTIFICATION OF DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF PUBLIC BUSINESS.
   (a)    Any person, upon written request and as provided herein, may obtain
reasonable advance notification of all meetings at which any specific type of
public business is scheduled to be discussed.

order payable to the City, in the amount of two dollars ($2.00) for each month
covered by the request, which amount has been determined by Council to

notification,
   Such requests may be modified or extended only by filing a complete new
request with the Clerk. A request shall not be deemed to be made unless it is
complete in all respects, and such request may be conclusively relied on by the

notification, by copies of the agendas, of all meetings of the municipal body
that is the subject of such request.

office's regular office hours to determine, based on information available at

notifications under Sections
105.04 through

or notices published thereunder.

111.01  COUNCIL RULES.
   (a)    Meetings.
      (1)    Regular meetings.  Regular meetings of Council shall be held in
the Council chambers at 7:30 p.m. on the first and third Monday of each month,
provided that regular meetings may be held once only during the months of July
and August. Regular meetings shall be held in the Council chambers on Wednesday
at 7:30 p.m. whenever the date of a regular meeting falls on a legal holiday.
Council may, by majority vote, change the day and hour of holding any regular
meeting, or adjourn the same to a day and hour determined by a like vote of the
members present, if constituting a quorum.
      (2)    Special meetings.  Council shall hold such special meetings as may
be found necessary, which may be called by the Clerk upon the written request
of the Mayor, or the President of Council, or upon the written request of three
members of Council. Any such vote or request for the calling of a special
meeting shall state the subject, or subjects, to be considered thereat, and no
other subject, or subjects, shall be considered, except upon the approval of
five or more of the members of Council in attendance at such special meeting.
Twenty-four hours notice in writing of such special meeting, if called by the
Mayor, the President of Council, or by three members of Council, shall be given
to each member of Council and to the Mayor by personal service or delivery
thereof at their usual place of residence, but members of Council may waive
such notice by their attendance at such special meeting.
   (b)    The Chair; Powers and Duties.
      (1)    Roll call. The Mayor, or in his absence, the President of Council,
shall take the chair at the hour appointed for Council to meet, and immediately
shall call Council to order. The roll shall be called by the Clerk, who shall
enter in the journal of each meeting the names of members present thereat. In
the absence of a quorum at the time appointed for a meeting, the members
present may, by a majority vote, take a recess or recesses, and cause the Clerk
to procure the attendance of absent members.
      (2)    Temporary chairman.  In the case of the absence of the Mayor and
the President of Council, the Clerk shall call the Council to order. The Clerk
shall call the roll, and if a quorum is found to be present, Council shall
proceed to elect, by a majority vote, a temporary chairman of the meeting until
the appearance of the Mayor or of the President of Council.
      (3)    Substitute chairman.  The chair, i.e. Mayor, President of Council,
or temporary chairman, may call any other member to take his place in the
chair, such substitution not to continue beyond adjournment.
      (4)    Appeals from decisions of the chair.  The chair shall preserve
decorum and decide all questions of order, subject to appeal to Council. If any
member transgresses these rules of Council, the chair shall, or any member may,
call him to order, and in the latter instance the chair shall render a decision
as to the point of order. In case of an appeal from a ruling of the chair, the
question shall be, "Shall the decision of the chair stand as the decision of
Council?" The chair shall be sustained unless overruled by a majority vote of
the members of Council present.
      (5)    Votes.  All questions shall be stated and put by the chair as
follows:
         A.    Roll call votes. The chair shall declare the vote after the
Clerk has announced the number of votes on each side.
      (6)    Chair's power to vote.  See Article IV Section
6.0 of the Charter.
   (c)    Members' Duties and Privileges.
      (1)    Seating arrangement.  Seats in the Council chamber shall be
numbered in order and all new members shall occupy all vacant seats after
drawing same by lot at the beginning of their term, except in the case of the
President of Council who shall sit at the right of the Mayor, and his seat
shall be number one.
      (2)    Addressing chair.  Members when about to speak to a question or
make a motion, shall address the chair as "Mr. Mayor, " "Mr. President, " or
"Mr. Chairman, " who shall pronounce the name of the member entitled to the
floor. Members addressing Council shall confine themselves to the question
under debate and avoid personalities.
      (3)    Limitation of debate.  No member shall be allowed to speak more
than once upon any one subject until every member choosing to speak shall have
spoken, nor more than twice upon the same subject, nor for a time longer than
five minutes, without leave of Council as expressed by a majority vote of the
members present. 
      (4)   Voting.  Every member present when a question is put shall vote on
the same, unless Council, for special reasons, excuses him from voting.  Such
excuse shall be granted only if the member states reasons for the request
before voting begins and Council, by majority vote of the members present,
accepts them.  There shall be no debate upon this question.
      (5)   Division of a question.  On demand on any member, a question under
consideration which covers two or more points shall be divided where the
question admits of such division.
      (6)   Excusal from attendance.  No member shall be excused from
attendance at a Council meeting, except upon request to and permission by the
Mayor prior to such meeting or by a vote of a majority of the members present.
      (7)   Excusal during meeting.  No member shall be excused while Council
is in session except upon permission of the chair.

         D.   Call of the members in alphabetical order that each may present

resolutions.
There shall be no interruption of business under this call.  All such
petitions, communications, motions, ordinances and resolutions shall be filed
with the Clerk not later than 12:00 noon on the Friday next preceding the
meeting day, and it shall be the duty of the Clerk to include the same in the
calendar of such meeting day, in their order upon the call.  Matters not filed
with the Clerk and introduced upon such call shall not be read or referred to,
but shall be held over until the next meeting, to be placed on the calendar and
taken up on the regular call of the members, unless leave for immediate
consideration is granted by a majority vote of the members present.

      (2)   Old business.  Following the roll call and reading of the journal
of the preceding meeting or waiver thereof, the business of regular meetings
shall commence at the point where the order of business at the preceding
meeting was interrupted by the adjournment, unless the order of business is
altered as provided herein.  For special meetings, see Article III Section
 9.0(b) of the Charter.
         (1964 Code §20.1)
   (e)   Committees.
      (1)   Appointment.  The following standing committees consisting of four
members each are hereby authorized.  Appointment of members to such committees
shall be made by the President of Council, subject to confirmation of a
majority vote of Council.
         A.   Finance Committee;
         B.   Safety Committee;
         C.   Streets Committee;
         D.   Utilities and Environment Committee;
         E.   Buildings and Grounds Committee;
         F.   Parks and Forestry Committee;
         G.   Annexation and Zoning Committee;
         H.   Employee and Community Relations Committee.
The Mayor may appoint such special committees as he deems necessary provided
that matters referred to or pending before a standing committee without consent
of its members be referred to or considered by a special committee.  (Ord. 12-
2004.  Passed 2-18-04.)
      (2)   Committee of the Whole.  The President of Council shall preside
when Council resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole.  These rules of
Council shall govern the Committee of the Whole except that no limit shall be
placed on time or frequency of speaking and that the previous question cannot
be moved.  All questions shall be decided by a majority vote of those members
present.  When this Committee arises, any measure, together with any amendments
thereto, reported out, shall receive the immediate consideration of Council
unless otherwise ordered placed upon the calendar.
      (3)   Meetings.  Committees shall meet on call of the chairman, or on
request of two members, communicated to the Clerk.
      (4)   Quorum.  A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute
a quorum.
      (5)   Temporary chairman.  In the absence of the chairman, the member
named next shall act as temporary chairman.
      (6)   Secretary to committees.  The Clerk or one of his assistants shall
act as secretary to each committee and shall keep a record of attendance and
business transacted at meetings thereof.
      (7)   Reports.  Reports of committees shall be agreed to by a majority
thereof.  All documents referred shall be returned to Council with the report
of the committee.  Upon motion, and by a majority vote, Council may relieve a
committee of further consideration of any question, and order it placed on the
calendar.  When any matter is referred to a committee with instructions to
report at a time named in the order of reference, failure to repot at such time
shall be considered as if reported back without recommendation, unless the time
for report is extended by Council. If no such extension is granted, the
committee shall forthwith return to the Clerk the documents pertaining thereto,
and the matter shall take its appropriate place on the calendar.
   (f)   Motions.
      (1)    Motions.  When a motion is made it shall be stated by the chair
before debate. Any member may demand that it be reduced to writing. A motion
shall not be withdrawn by the mover without the consent of Council. Unless
otherwise required by law, or the Charter, a motion shall be deemed passed if
it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present including
the chair, if entitled to vote thereon.
      (2)    Order of precedence.  When a question is before Council, no motion
shall be entertained except the following:
         A.    To adjourn.
         B.    To lay on the table.
         C.    The previous question.
         D.    To postpone to a certain time.
         E.    To refer.
         F.    To amend.
         G.    To postpone indefinitely.
         Such motions shall have precedence in the foregoing order.
      (3)    Motion to adjourn.  Motions to adjourn shall be in order at any
time, except as follows:
         A.    When repeated without intervening business or discussion.
         B.    When made while another member is speaking.
         C.    When the previous question has been ordered.
         D.    While a vote is being taken.
   A motion to adjourn is not debatable, except as to the time to which the
meeting is adjourned.
      (4)    Motion to lay on the table.  A motion to lay on the table shall
preclude all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If the
motion prevails, the consideration of the subject may be resumed only upon
motion of a member voting with the majority and with the consent of the
majority of the members present.
      (5)    Previous question.  The previous question shall be stated in these
words: "Shall debate now close ?" The motion shall pass if two-thirds of the
members present favor it. If the motion is ordered, there shall be no further
amendment or debate, but the question shall be put immediately.
      (6)    Motion to postpone.  Motions to postpone may be amended as to
time, excepting a motion to postpone indefinitely. If a motion to postpone
indefinitely is carried, the principal question shall be declared lost.
      (7)    Motion to amend.  A motion to amend shall be susceptible of but
one amendment. An amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the same
form.
      (8)    Motion to suspend rules.  A motion to suspend the rule which
requires three readings shall be debatable. Upon the passage of such motion,
the main question shall be open to debate. All other rules may be suspended by
a majority of members of Council present without debate.
      (9)    Motion to reconsider.  A motion to reconsider a proposal that has
been acted upon favorably must be made before adjournment of the session of
Council at which the vote was taken. A motion to reconsider any other action
taken by Council may be made not later than the next regular meeting after the
vote of Council thereon. In either case such motion may be made only by a
member who voted with the prevailing side. The concurrence of a majority of the
members present shall be sufficient for reconsideration of a vote. If a motion
to reconsider is lost, it shall not be entertained again.
   (g)    Miscellaneous.
      (1)    Procedure in absence of rule. In the absence of a rule to govern a
point of procedure, reference shall be had to the approved practice in
parliamentary bodies.
      (2)    Decorum in Council chambers.  The chair shall maintain decorum in
Council chambers during sessions. Persons, other than members of Council, City
officials, and members of the press, shall not be permitted upon the floor of
Council, or to address Council, except upon introduction by the chair or a
member of Council. If anyone, other than a City official, desires to speak to a
member of Council while it is in session, the member, if agreeable to the
request, shall leave his seat and retire to the rear of the Council chambers or
elsewhere until the conversation is finished.
      (3)    Rule on readings and suspension of rules.  See Article III Section
11.0(b) of the Charter.
      (4)    Emergency measures.  A roll call shall first be taken on the
emergency clause and then a roll call on the legislation as a whole.
      (5)    "Majority."  Whenever the term "majority" is used herein, unless
otherwise expressly indicated, it shall be held to mean a majority of those
members elected to Council.
      (6)    Amending rules.  A majority vote is required to alter, amend,
rescind or supplement these rules. Any proposed alterations, or amendments or
supplements shall be submitted in writing at a regular meeting and placed on
the calendar for the next regular meeting under the order of new business. By
unanimous recorded vote of all members elected to Council, such proposed
alterations, amendments or supplements may be adopted at the meeting at which
the same are submitted.
      (7)    Quorum.  A majority of all members elected to Council shall
constitute a quorum.
      (8)    Director of Law.  The Director of Law shall, when requested by a
member of Council, give a verbal opinion on any question of law concerning City
affairs, in open Council, but he may, if he deems the matter of importance,
take a reasonable time to submit his opinion in writing. He shall not be
required to draw any ordinance or resolution except upon a majority vote of the
members.

(100%) of the cost of tuition (excluding specifically, but not in limitation,
books and laboratory fees) for approved courses of study at an accredited
institution of learning when such study is undertaken in a field reasonably
related to the employee's work duties.  To qualify for such tuition
reimbursement, an employee must obtain advanced approval in accordance with
procedures established by the City, must submit proof of tuition cost
acceptable to the City, and must achieve a passing grade of "C" or its
equivalent or better.  An employee shall not be entitled to such tuition
reimbursement for courses which will qualify the employee for a new job or
profession.

successive steps.  Upon recommendation of the Mayor, Council may approve
initial compensation at a rate higher than the entrance rate in the pay range
for the class when the needs of the service make such action necessary;
provided that any such exception is based on the outstanding and unusual
character of the employee's experience and ability over and above the
qualification requirements specified for the class, or that a critical shortage
of applicants exists.  Such employee shall have his longevity computed as if he
had already acquired the minimum service represented by the step into which
hired for purposes of future salary increases only.  In the latter case any
incumbents receiving a lower rate shall have their rates increased to the rate
established for entrance of new employees.

in the same class of positions after a separation from the City service of not

circumstances, such employee shall receive the base rate in the pay range
corresponding to the base rate received at the time of separation and shall
subsequently serve there for at least such period as is normally required for
advancement to the next higher skill/merit step rate.
      (3)   Starting rate in new position.  Whenever an employee is assigned to
duty in a position not previously held by him and such change is not in the
nature of a promotion, he shall receive the entrance rate in the range
established for such position or such other rate within the applicable range as
he may be entitled to by reason of crediting him in his new position with such
prior service that is found to meet the following conditions:  the character
and nature of the duties of the position to which the employee was assigned are
similar to those of the new position; and the service in the former position
provided experience valuable to the performance of the new position.
   (b)   Salary Advancement Within Range by Skill/Merit Steps.  Salary within
the ranges for the respective classes shall be based on skill and/or merit and
advancement shall be from the entrance rate or one of the skill/merit steps to
the next higher available skill/merit step.  There shall be a first year skill/
merit step, a second year skill/merit step and a third year skill/merit step
which may be granted at minimum intervals of one year between such steps over
the first five years of employment.  Upon the completion of five years of
continuous service within the City, an employee shall advance to the fifth year
skill/merit step.  Advancement from the entrance rate to the first year skill/
merit step may be granted after the first eleven months of employment. 
Advancement to any skill/merit step shall not be available and shall not be
granted after five years and one day of employment.
 
   (c)   Longevity Factors.  Longevity factors are provided in the Compensation
Plan to provide financial recognition for long and faithful service where the
opportunity for promotion is limited and where there is no provision for
further advancement within the base pay range.  Such longevity factors shall be
applied as follows:
      (1)   Any employee performing satisfactorily in a position classified
hereunder, specifically excluding, however, those listed in Section
139.03(d)(3) and (4), who has been continuously employed by the City for a
period of five years or longer shall have his compensation increased to that
amount which results from multiplying his base rate of pay by the longevity
factor of base pay set forth in Section
139.10(a), Schedule I, to the right of the number of full years of service such
employee has continuously been employed by the City.
      (2)   Effective January 1, 1999, the positions of Police Captain, Sewage
Maintenance Crew Leader, Street Maintenance Crew Leader, Water Maintenance Crew
Leader, Vehicle Maintenance Manager and Parks and Forestry Crew Leader shall be

      (3)   All full-time employees hired after January 1, 2000, specifically
excluding all those listed in Section 139.03(d)(3) and (4), with five or more
years of continuous service with the City shall be entitled to annual longevity
payments in accordance with the following schedule:

20 years through 24 years 1300.00
25 years or more          1600.00
 
      (4)   This “Longevity Factors” provision does not apply to promotions
into the positions listed in Item (2) above or new hires on or after January 1,
2015.
   All such longevity payments shall be paid on the pay date following the
employee’s anniversary date. (Ord. 4-2000.  Passed 1-3-00; Ord. 10-2013. 
Passed 1-22-13; Ord. 29-2015.  Passed 5-4-15.)
   (d)   Requirements as to Continuity of Service and Limitation on
Applicability of Longevity.  Service requirements specified in this chapter
shall have the implication of continuous service, which means employment in the
City service without break or interruption.
      (1)   Leaves of absences with pay and leaves without pay of ten or less
days shall not interrupt continuous service nor be deducted therefrom. 
Absences on leave without pay in excess of ten days shall be deducted in
computing total service and shall be deemed to have interrupted continuous
service except as provided in Section
139.07(e)(1).
      (2)   Except as provided for in Section
139.07(e)(1) any employee of the City whose employment with the City is
terminated for any reason whatsoever, voluntary or involuntary, and who is
subsequently re-employed by the City within one year of such termination, shall
not be eligible for a base rate higher than skill/merit step five and shall
not, anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, be eligible to have his
base rate on re-employment increased by the longevity factor until after five
continuous years from the time of being re-employed and then only by the
longevity factor on the salary and wage scale to the right of that total number
of full years of service comprised of five years plus the years of service
prior to termination and the years of service after being rehired, with no
retroactivity permitted.  If such a terminated employee is not re-employed
within one year of such termination, he shall never have the right to any
longevity benefits.
   (e)   Initial Adjustments to the Compensation Plan.  In order to bring all
pay rates into conformity with the new pay schedule provided in this chapter,
the following rules for application and adjustment shall be effective, subject
to dates of promotion, in fixing the rates of pay of incumbents of positions of
January 1, 1979, the time of the effective date of this chapter:
      (1)   An employee’s base rate on January 1, 1979, depending upon years of
service, shall be as follows:
 
YEARS OF SERVICE         BASE RATE
Less than one            Entrance

Two, but less than three Second year merit step
Three, four and five     Third year merit step
 
      (2)   Each employee’s rate of pay under this chapter effective January 1,
1979, shall be compared with such employee’s rate of pay as it was immediately
prior to January 1, 1979, and the higher of the two shall be utilized for the
inauguration of this new plan effective January 1, 1979.
      (3)   The Treasurer is hereby authorized to promulgate such additional
rules as may be necessary to implement the legislative intent on changing from
a two-schedule salary and wage schedule to one schedule and from an automatic
base rate step plan to a skill/merit base rate step plan.
      (4)   An employee’s base rate on and after January 1, 1991, depending
upon years of service, shall be as follows:
 
YEARS OF SERVICE          BASE RATE
Less than one             Entrance
One, but less than two    First year merit step
Two, but less than three  Second year merit step
Three, but less than five Third year merit step
Five and more             Fifth year merit step
 
      (Ord.  57-91.  Passed 6-17-91.)
   (f)   Rate of Pay Upon Demotion.
      (1)   An employee demoted while being paid within the base salary range,
from a position in one class to a position having a lower salary range shall
receive a salary decrease of not less than one salary step.
      (2)   An employee whose salary includes a longevity factor for his class
and is subsequently demoted to a position in a class having a lower salary
range shall have the longevity factor appropriate for his years of service
applied to the base rate in the lower salary range.
   (g)   Rate of Pay Upon Transfer.  An employee who is transferred to another
position in the same class grade shall continue to receive the same pay rate
until he is promoted or demoted, or until his pay rate is adjusted in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
 
   (h)   Rate of Pay on Promotion.  Upon promotion to a class grade having a
higher salary range an employee shall receive the pay commanded by his new
position at the base rate thereof increased by the appropriate longevity factor
for his years of service.  Advancement subsequent to promotion shall be on the
same basis as described in subsection (b) hereof with the service prior to
promotion being taken into account.
 
   (i)   Reassignment of Classes to Salary Groups.  Whenever a class of
positions is reassigned to a higher salary group, all employees occupying
positions in such class at the time of reassignment shall be paid at the same
step in the higher salary group to which the class of positions is reassigned. 
(Ord.  51-86.  Passed 5-5-86.)
139.05  OVERTIME AND EMERGENCY CALL-IN PAY.
   (a)   Overtime Administration.  A department may prescribe reasonable
periods of overtime work to meet operational needs.  Such overtime shall be
reported and justified as required by the Treasurer.  Complete records of
overtime of employees shall be maintained by each department head and the
Director of Finance.
(Ord.  56-96.  Passed 6-3-96.)
 
   (b)   Overtime Compensation for Certain Salaried Employees.  A salaried
employee included on the list of occupational titles in a position of Water
Maintenance Crew Leader, Sewer Maintenance Crew Leader, Street Maintenance Crew
Leader, Parks and Forestry Crew Leader, and Vehicle Maintenance Manager when
required to work pursuant to subsection (a) hereof shall be paid at the rate of
time and one-half the regular rate for all hours worked over eight in any one
day or for all hours worked over forty in any one week, whichever is greater,
but not for both.  The work schedule shall be maintained by the division's
administrative head or his appointed deputy and filed with the employee's work
record with the Treasurer.
(Ord. 10-2013.  Passed 1-22-13.)
   Those employees listed above may elect to take compensatory time off in
place of overtime pay.  Should an employee elect to accumulate compensatory
time in lieu of overtime pay for any overtime worked, the employee may request
such compensatory time using the applicable form provided by the City.  Request
for compensatory time must be submitted to the employee’s Foreman no later than
when the employee’s pay sheets are submitted, otherwise the employee will be
paid for the overtime.
   No employee may accumulate more than forty hours of compensatory time within
one calendar year and it shall be accumulated at the overtime rate. 
Compensatory time must be used by the last pay period of each calendar year and
those hours not used at that time will be paid in cash at the rate of pay of
when they were earned.  Compensatory time must be taken in increments of not
less than one hour.  Requests for leave chargeable to compensatory time will be
formulated in accordance with procedures established by the City and must not
present a scheduling conflict or interfere with the orderly operation of the
division or section.
(Ord.  5-2001.  Passed 1-2-01.)
      (1)   All hours not worked Monday through Friday, or through the normally
scheduled work week, for any personal reason of the employee, shall be offset
against hours worked on Saturday and Sunday, or the sixth and seventh day of
the normal work week, and shall be paid at the straight time rate.  For
example, an employee with a normal work week of Monday through Friday who has
an excused absence for eight hours on Friday for personal reasons and then
returns to work on Saturday, a normal day off, and works eight hours, shall not
be permitted to count as hours worked for overtime purposes those hours for the
excused absence and thus the Saturday hours shall be paid at straight time.
      (2)   On legal holidays as so recognized herein by the City, an employee
who has worked the last scheduled full work day preceding the holiday and the
first scheduled full work day following the holiday shall receive credit for
overtime purposes, for the number of hours he was normally scheduled to work. 
For example, an employee with a normal five day, forty hour week has a holiday
on Monday and works the balance of the week as follows:
 
Monday - holiday                                  
Tuesday through Friday - 8 hours each            32 hours
Saturday - 8 hours                               8 hours
Total actually worked                            40 hours
                                                 
Such employee’s calculation would be as follows 
                                                 
Hours worked                                     40 hours
Holiday credit - not worked                      8 hours
Hours credited for overtime                      48 hours
                                                 
8 hours’ overtime at 1.5                       12 hours
Hours worked at straight time                    32 hours
Straight time pay - hours worked                 44 hours
Holiday pay - 8 hours not worked                 8 hours
Total at straight time                           52 hours
(Ord. 56-96.  Passed 6-3-96.)
   (c)   Emergency Call-In. An employee, other than those listed in Section
139.03 (d(3) and (4), except the Water Maintenance Crew Leader, Sewer
Maintenance Crew Leader, Street Maintenance Crew Leader, Parks and Forestry
Crew Leader, and Vehicle Maintenance Manager called into work to do
unscheduled, unforeseen or emergency work other than during his regularly
scheduled work period shall be paid a minimum of four hours' pay at the regular
rate or actual hours worked at the applicable overtime rate, whichever is
greater; provided, however, that this emergency call-in provision shall not
apply when an employee is called in early to his regular scheduled work period
and works continuously from the time of so reporting for such early call-in to
his regular scheduled work period.  For example, if an employee's regular work
day is 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., no call-in pay would be applicable if the
employee was called in at 7:30 a.m. and worked through to the beginning of his
regular work day of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  (Ord. 10- 2013.  Passed 1-22-13.)
   (d)   Duplicating or Pyramiding of Overtime Pay.  There shall be no
duplicating or pyramiding of any overtime pay for the same hours worked.  When
one or more premium or overtime rate is payable, the single higher rate shall
apply.
(Ord.  56-96.  Passed 6-3-96.)
139.06  HOLIDAYS.

probationary period, which, for purposes hereof, shall mean not to exceed
ninety days, in addition to the holidays otherwise provided for under this

prior written notice to the employee's immediate superior of the date of the
floating holiday selected by the employee.
(Ord. 10-2013.  Passed 1-22-13.)

163.01  CIVIL OFFENSE DEFINED.
   A civil offense means an offense against the City of Sylvania set forth in
the Sylvania Codified Ordinances made subject to a civil fine by this chapter. 
Charging a person with a civil offense is an alternative to criminal
prosecution.  A person may not be charged with a civil offense if that person
has been charged with a misdemeanor of the same offense.  A person charged with
a civil offense may not be arrested for the commission of the offense.
(Ord. 39-2008.  Passed 5-5-08.)
163.02  CLASSIFICATION OF CIVIL OFFENSES.
   A person who violates a standard of conduct set forth in a section or
chapter of the Sylvania Codified Ordinances listed below is liable for the
civil fine specified in Section
163.99 for a civil offense.  If the provision is listed below, the otherwise
applicable civil fine is reduced by fifty percent (50%) if the person charged
shows in accordance with Section
163.04 that the violation has been corrected.  If a person has previously been
found to have violated the same provision of the Sylvania Codified Ordinances
within one year that person may be charged as a second offender and on being
found to have committed a second or subsequent offense is liable for the civil
fine specified in Section
163.99 for the offense provided below, which fine is not subject to reduction
for correction of the violation.

within 10 days of the date of the mailing of the decision by the hearing
examiner.  The City officer or employee who issued the notice of violation
which gave rise to the request for review or a supervisor to the issuing
officer may file a written response to the request for review.  The response

Prosecutor.  The Sylvania Municipal Court may set aside the decision of the
hearing on finding from review of the proceedings before the hearing examiner
that the findings of fact and conclusions of law are not supported by the

the civil fine would cause an undue hardship and that the underlying infraction
has been cured or is unlikely to reoccur.  The Sylvania Municipal Court may
investigate a claim that an infraction has been cured, make findings with
respect to the claim of cure, and include those findings within the record. 
The decision of the Sylvania Municipal Court may be appealed to the Sixth
District Court of Appeals in the same manner in form as any civil action filed
with the Municipal Court.

the end of each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Commissioner if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under Section
 171.09 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any

   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Commissioner.

file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Commissioner listing the

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Commissioner shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
171.05 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
171.02 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Commissioner may require the employer to
provide the Tax Commissioner with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Commissioner and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
171.05 of this Chapter.

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.

for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041

lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Commissioner all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records

interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.

fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

returns required under this section.  (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.06  DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT

   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
171.02(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner
of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
171.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
 171.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Commissioner or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Commissioner and taxpayer
before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or

         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            (Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the

commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
171.08 of this Chapter.
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
 171.02 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that

that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
171.80 of this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(B)(1) or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.

   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations

shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
 171.02(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
171.02 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
171.061 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
 171.061 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
171.061 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Sectio
n 171.061 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.

the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first
time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

provided in this section.
         (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year

month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability
for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year.
            (Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.  When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
 171.09 of this Chapter.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless
extended pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)     For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the

described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
171.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
(Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY
   It is the intent of this section that a taxpayer, subject to tax in more
than one municipality on the same income, who has complied with the provisions
hereof shall not be required by this chapter to pay a total municipal income
tax on such income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
     Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter:
   (a)     When a resident of Sylvania is subject to and has paid or has
acknowledged liability for, a municipal income tax in another municipality on
the same income taxable under this chapter and such other municipality does not
allow a credit to its nonresidents, such Sylvania resident may claim a credit
of the amount of such tax paid to the other municipality but not in excess of
the tax imposed by this Chapter.  The taxpayer claiming such credit must attach
proof of the amount paid to another municipality to the tax return.
   (b)     If the tax due such other municipality has been paid to or withheld
in such other municipality, a resident of Sylvania may claim credit for and
assign Sylvania any claim for refund to which he may be entitled from such
other municipality. In the event an amount is not received by Sylvania equal to
such credit claimed by reason of tax payments made to, or withheld in such
other municipality, then the taxpayer shall be liable to Sylvania for an amount
by which the claimed credit exceeds the amount recovered on such assignment by
Sylvania, together with penalty and interest. If satisfactory evidence is
offered, however, that the taxpayer is entitled to the claim covered by the
assignment, such taxpayer shall not be deprived of credit therefor because of
fault or neglect on the part of either municipality.
   (c)     Assignment of any claim for refund to which a Sylvania resident may
be entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment
of that portion of the Sylvania income tax represented by such assignment;
provided that an overpayment resulting from the credit allowed by reason of
such assignment shall not be refunded until such assignment has been remitted
to Sylvania by such other municipality.
   (d)     The credits provided for shall not be allowed unless the same are
claimed in a timely return or form acceptable to, and filed with the
Commissioner. In the event a taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to file such
timely return or form he shall not be entitled to such credit and shall be
liable for the full amount of tax assessed by this chapter, together with such
interest and penalties, both civil and criminal, as are prescribed in this
chapter.
   (e)     No credit shall be given for any tax paid to a school district or
county taxes.
      (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.081 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the

compensation.  (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.082 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
 171.08 of this Chapter.  (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.083 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
 171.095 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
171.095, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
171.095 of this Chapter.

171.08 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.  (Ord.
67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.09  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)     The Tax Commissioner shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
171.05(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
Municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers shall file an annual municipal
income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of income or liability.

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. 
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this

who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Commissioner unless the Tax Commissioner requests such copies after the return
has been filed.  An individual taxpayer requesting an extension shall also
provide a copy of the federal extension form to the municipal corporation.

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Commissioner. 
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Commissioner
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Commissioner on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax

profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
Commissioner on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax Commissioner or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Commissioner.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
171.091 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
171.091 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
171.091 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
171.05 of this Chapter. 
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Commissioner or other municipal official with which the report,
claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to which the
payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on the cover
in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed
shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment. "The date of
postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)     If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Commissioner for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may  not  be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
171.05 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as
credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with
the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld. 
   
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Commissioner to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax  Commissioner with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Commissioner for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Commissioner and
has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Commissioner about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Commissioner from contacting
the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Commissioner of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Commissioner, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
171.051 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Commissioner that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax Commissioner is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Commissioner shall not require the person to file any tax
return for the taxable year unless the Tax Commissioner possesses information
that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the
affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results in work
being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that results
in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the taxable
year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax Commissioner for the taxable year.  Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Commissioner from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Commissioner of the

Commissioner considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Commissioner ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Commissioner shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Commissioner shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Commissioner
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.  (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.092 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law.  The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.  (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.093 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

be the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
Tax Commissioner on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Commissioner grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject

thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Commissioner before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
171.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
171.095 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.095 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Commissioner of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Commissioner shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Commissioner shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer
whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall
state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Commissioner denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Commissioner shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
171.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal  income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
171.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)     As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as
in Section
 171.10 of this Chapter.  (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Commissioner shall prescribe a form by which
a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the taxpayer in
the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax Commissioner.
If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax Commissioner may accept
other evidence, as the Tax Commissioner considers appropriate, that a person is

the nearest whole dollar.  If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document. 
(Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.13  AUTHORITY OF TAX COMMISSIONER; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
COMMISSIONER.

TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Commissioner may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Commissioner may require.
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Commissioner may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Commissioner shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement.  (Ord. 67-2015. 
Passed 12-7-15.)
171.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX COMMISSIONER; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Commissioner believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee
to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal and state
income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Commissioner believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Commissioner of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Commissioner determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person
to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records,
and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession or
control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This
division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

with the Tax Commissioner to provide identifying information, which may include
the person's social security number, federal employer identification number, or
other identification number requested by the Tax Commissioner. A person
required by the Tax Commissioner to provide identifying information that has
experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify the Tax
Commissioner of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax document
requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Commissioner makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Commissioner does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Commissioner from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
 171.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
 171.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Commissioner to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Commissioner of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Commissioner
from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
171.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
171.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
171.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Commissioner by law.
         (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Commissioner of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Commissioners of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Commissioner, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Commissioner as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Commissioner shall be an "opinion of the Tax Commissioner" and shall bind the
Tax Commissioner, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Commissioner's response is signed by the Tax Commissioner
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Commissioner."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Commissioner's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Commissioner
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Commissioner;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
              (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Commissioner was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
171.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Commissioner provides written advice under this section, the

   (F)    A Tax Commissioner may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Commissioner only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Commissioner issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Commissioner binds that Tax Commissioner only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Commissioner of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Commissioner shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Commissioner has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Commissioner issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Commissioner shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Commissioner may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Commissioner or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the person
to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Commissioner as
prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Commissioner
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Commissioner originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Commissioner or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Commissioner or other official from entering into a compromise
with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the
Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 67-2015.  Passed 12-7-15.)
171.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code

preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,

authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.

qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Commissioner issues an assessment, the Tax
Commissioner shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Commissioner's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Commissioner may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.

adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Commissioner. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any

any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
171.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as

171.81  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
171.02 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
171.80 to
 171.95 of the Codified Ordinances.

municipal corporation under section
171.82 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal

section
171.02 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable

income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,

the     computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
 171.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or

171.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B) of section
171.02 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (23)(E)(ii) of section
171.02 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a

respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
171.02(47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
171.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)

profession in the Municipality and that has made the election under section
171.80 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
171.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and  services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax  commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by  division (A) of section
171.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment  method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.

sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Municipality
from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.

Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the

sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Municipality in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Municipality to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section
 171.02 of the Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or
substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal
corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case
shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to
the Municipality any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would
be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

171.80 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to

prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)   If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the Municipality reserves its right
to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
171.85  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF  FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

information.
         (b)   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission

to which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for  filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner  grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or  before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall  grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (C)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
171.01 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (D)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.

171.86   CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of  providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or  special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or  loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section    5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file  a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must  be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1)of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
171.80 of the     Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer
under division (B)(1) or (2) of section 171.063 of the Codified Ordinances is
binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section
171.80 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that

   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section,  corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
171.81 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income"  wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
171.81 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
171.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
171.82 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in section
171.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
171.82 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
171.87  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.

sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section 194.90 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
171.88  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for  the taxable year;

beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;   
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not    accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable
year, the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the  commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state.  The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in
division (B) of  section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless  the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent  of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of  the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
171.89  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.

 171.80 to
 171.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the

      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
 171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to

penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
171.90 of the Codified Ordinances without regard  to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
 171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
171.90   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
171.91 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time.    There shall
be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a
return subject to assessment as required by sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section 194.91 of the Codified Ordinances, with
interest on that amount as provided by that section.  (Ord.  15-2018.  Passed
3-5-18.)
171.91   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
171.90 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten  dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater  than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance  with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each  municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that  municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next  distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
171.92    AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
section
171.80 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
 171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
171.90 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
171.91 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
171.91 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.  (Ord.  15-2018.  Passed 3-5-18.)
171.93  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
 171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
171.80 to
171.95 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

the credit is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Municipality and  taxpayer of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify
the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.

175.01  DEFINITIONS.
   When used in this chapter and unless otherwise distinctly expressed, the
following words and phrases shall have the meanings set out herein:
   (a)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)    "Director" means the Director of Finance of the City.
   (c)    "Hotel or motel" means every establishment, including motor inns,
kept, used, maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place
where sleeping accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in
which five or more rooms are used for the accommodations of such guests,
whether such rooms are in one or several structures, and referred to in this
chapter as "hotel."
   (d)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)    "Operator" means any person who is the proprietor of the hotel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee or any other capacity. Where
the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or
character, other than an employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an
operator for the purposes of this chapter, and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by
either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be
compliance by both.
   (g)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibits, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes. (Ord.106 -2002. Passed 10- 21-2002.)
175.02  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City, for the use of the general fund of the City, an excise tax is hereby
levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests.
   (b)    The tax is three percent (3%) on all rents paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the
transient guest to the City, which is extinguished only by payment to the
operator as trustee for the City, or to the City. The tax applies and is
collectible at the time the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when
the price is paid.
   (c)    For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels
in the City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is
established.
(Ord. 106 -2002. Passed 10-21-2002.)
175.03  EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)    No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)   Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or the laws of Ohio or the United States;

shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the Director shall give not less than five days written
notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time
and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be
fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may
appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should
not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Director shall determine the proper
tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in

within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.
The Board shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give
notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of business. The
findings of the Board shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.
Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the
service of notice.

natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor

residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give  the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a

the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.

storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

to 4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the

   (g)   Whoever violates subsection (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the  transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;

      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains

storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if

possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a

   (EDITOR’S NOTE:  The provisions of former Section
303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.  (ORC 4513.65)

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole

administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.

in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

335.01  DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   No person shall receive a driver's license, or a motorcycle operator's
endorsement of a driver's or commercial driver's license, unless and until he

jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio.  No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.  The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

the owner presents proof of ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing
and storage fees normally imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing
motor vehicles.  If the motor vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be
released to the lessee until the lessee presents proof that that person is the
lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles.

or for the transport of a handicapped person and is displaying a parking card
or special handicapped license plates, the motor vehicle is permitted to park
for a period of two hours in excess of the legal parking period permitted by

351.23  SNOW EMERGENCY PARKING BAN.
   (a)    Determination of Snow Emergency. A snow emergency shall be declared
by the Mayor, or his designee, to be a period of time prior to, during and
after a snow fall during which period of time the parking of motor vehicles on
public streets would in the determination of the Mayor, or his designee,
hinder, delay and obstruct the safe flow of traffic and emergency vehicles and
the proper cleaning, clearing and making safe of all public streets of this
City. The Mayor, or his designee, using a combination of available forecasts,
may declare a snow emergency to exist when the City is expected to receive a
snow fall of four inches or more. The snow emergency may be declared prior to
the City receiving the snowfall if the snow is expected to accumulate overnight
or during snow plowing operations. Such emergency shall continue in effect
until an announcement by the Mayor, or his designee, that the snow emergency is
no longer in effect. The City shall make a reasonable effort to announce the
existence of the snow emergency and shall make similar reasonable efforts to
announce the termination of such emergency. Owners and operators of motor
vehicles shall have full responsibility to determine existing weather
conditions and to comply with emergency parking regulations when a snow
emergency is in effect.
   (b)    No Parking During Snow Emergency. During the period of snow
emergency, and continuing until the street is plowed to the curb, no person
shall park or cause or permit to be parked, or permit to remain parked or
abandon or leave unattended any motor vehicle of any kind or description, upon
any and all public streets. However, attended vehicles may be parked for a
reasonable period of time (generally not to exceed five minutes, but
recognizing additional time may be reasonable to accommodate elderly or
handicapped persons) to allow for the actual loading or unloading of
passengers, or for actual loading or unloading of property, provided that an
operator of such vehicle is immediately available, and provided further that
the operator of the motor vehicle shall move the motor vehicle promptly to
accommodate emergency or snow removal vehicles.
   (c)    Removal of Illegally Parked Vehicles. The Director of Public Service,
Police Chief or any member of the Police Division is hereby authorized and
empowered to provide for the removal of any vehicle parked on any of the
designated snow emergency streets or roads during the period of snow emergency,
to a garage or other place as any such person deems proper. Any costs incurred
in such removal and storage shall be paid for by the owner of the vehicle and
such costs shall be in addition to any fines or penalties which may be imposed
on the owner or  operator of the vehicle, and shall be paid before the violator
can recover his vehicle.
   (d)    Snow Removal. After such emergency has been declared as set forth
herein, no person shall push or place additional snow and ice upon streets or
portions of streets from driveways, sidewalks, parking lots or from any other
places.
   (e)   Penalty.  The owner or operator of a motor vehicle found in violation
of the prohibitions of this chapter shall be deemed to have committed a minor
misdemeanor parking infraction. On a second offense within one year after the
first offense, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If
within one year of the first offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of two or more offenses hereunder, whoever violates a section of this
chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to the
penalties allowable by law, the
owner or operator of a motor vehicle found in violation of this chapter shall
be responsible for all towing and storage costs for such vehicle during the
snow emergency.

the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.  (ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section by attempting to commit a violation of
Chapter
513 or a felony of the fourth degree contained in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925, shall
be punished in accordance with the provisions of Section
501.99(c).
(Ord.  110-93.  Passed 9-8-93.)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude
or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may
affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion, and
require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY HELD BY POLICE DIVISION.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.)
501.14  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:

legal formalities have been complied with and that the work has been done
properly and satisfactorily, and shall be full notice to every person concerned

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,

A permit shall be issued only after the application is processed by the Service

(Ord. 35-69. Passed 8-4-69.)
901.02  MOVING A PERMANENT BUILDING.
   No person shall move a permanent building over, upon, through or across any

hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for street cleaning costs.  The street cleaning
deposit shall be paid to the Director of Public Service prior to the issuance
of a building permit and, with respect to a subdivision, prior to the
commencement of any subdivision improvements, including soil removal.  The
Director of  Public Service may waive the street cleaning deposit for any

streets, the Zoning Administrator shall notify him in writing of the
violation.  The permit holder or developer shall promptly correct the violation
within eight hours after receiving such notice.  In the event that the
violation is not corrected within that period, the City may proceed to clean
the street itself and deduct the reasonable value of the street cleaning from
the deposit made pursuant to subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   If, in the opinion of the Director of Public Service or his designee,
a hazard to the public exists because of the amount, type, or condition of
material in a street, the street may be immediately cleaned by the City, and
the cost of the cleaning deducted from the permit holder’s or developer’s
deposit without prior notification to the depositor of the violation.
   (d)   If during the course of construction or improvements, the deductions
for street cleanings made by the City reduce the deposit balance to less than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the original deposit amount, the permit holder or
developer who made the deposit shall make an additional deposit in order to
bring the balance to not less than 100 percent (100%) of the original deposit
amount.  If such additional deposit is not made within three days after the
depositor has been notified by the Director of Public Service, the City may
order all construction or improvement stopped until such time as the additional
deposit is received.
   (e)   As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

905.01  PERMIT REQUIRED; FEE.
   (a)    No person, firm or corporation shall make any excavation in any
street, alley, sidewalk or public way within the City unless a permit to make

administrative officer. Application shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Service Director, giving the exact location of the proposed excavation, the
kind of paving, the area and depth to be excavated and such other facts as the
Service Director may deem necessary. The permit shall be issued only after a
cash deposit sufficient to cover the cost of restoration, as determined by the
Service Director, has been deposited with the Clerk-Auditor, conditioned upon
prompt and satisfactory refilling of excavation and restoration of all surfaces
disturbed. The fee for such permit, payable prior to issuance of the permit,
shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00). Public utilities nevertheless may supply the
City with a written undertaking satisfactory to the Director of Public Service
and the Director of Law, in lieu of such cash deposit and may, in lieu of

905.03  METHOD OF EXCAVATION; TUNNELING.
   In opening any street, public easement, alley, sidewalk, street right of way
or public way all materials for paving and ballasting must be removed with the
least possible injury or loss of the same and together with excavating material
from the trench must be placed where they will cause the least practicable
inconvenience to the public. As little as possible of the trench shall be dug
until the junction piece in the utility line is found unless it is first
determined that a new opening into the line should be made. Whenever the sides
of the trenches will not stand perpendicular sheeting, braces must be used to
prevent unnecessary caving, and in no case shall the work be done by tunneling,
unless authorized and directed by the Director. Safety rules promulgated by the
Director shall be adhered to.
(Ord. 35-69. Passed 8-4-69.)
905.04  BARRIERS AND WARNING LIGHTS.
   All excavations in any street, public easement, alley, sidewalk, street
right of way or other public way shall be carefully guarded at all times with
sufficient barriers, which during the nighttime shall be indicated by colored
lights or torches or such other precautions as shall be necessary to guard the
public against accidents. At all times the work shall be done so as to cause
the least inconvenience to the property owners and the general public. The cost
of such barricades, warning lights or such other features the Director may
require shall be borne by the contractor. (Ord. 35-69. Passed 8-4-69.)
905.05  RESTORATION OF PAVEMENT.
   (a)    The restoration of pavement or other surface shall be performed under
the direction and to the satisfaction of the Service Director.
   (b)    The backfilling over the drains, sewers or other utility lines, after
they have been laid and accepted by the proper official, shall be done with
granular material and tamped to the top of the pavement. All backfill and
bedding shall be performed as directed by the Service Director. All paving
which is removed must be replaced within forty-eight hours after the completion
of the work in the excavation, unless instructed by the Service Director. The
restoration shall be done so as to make the pavement at least as good as it was
before it was disturbed. The contractor shall be responsible for any subsequent
settlement of the ground or pavement. All other utility lines must be protected
from settlement or injury. All utilities whose lines are encountered shall be
immediately contacted by the contractor.
   (c)    Upon failure or refusal of the permittee satisfactorily to fill the
excavations, restore the surface and remove all excess materials within the
time specified in the permit, or, where not specified therein, within a
reasonable time after commencement of the work, the Service Director shall have
it done and the cost thereof shall be deducted from the deposit posted as
provided in Section
905.01. If the cost of such restoration exceeds the amount of such deposit, the
proper officer of the City shall proceed to collect the remainder due from such
permittee, and no permit shall be subsequently granted until such amounts are
paid.
(Ord. 35-69.  Passed 8-4-69.)

agreement to annex to the City, the owner of such land must also agree to
require a similar agreement from anyone to whom they sell all or any part of
their land.

the City, and which newly annexed lots and lands have not been especially
assessed for the construction of any such water mains or lines whether such tap
is directly into such water mains or lines or by way of newly constructed water
mains or lines, such owner of any such lots or lands shall, for the right and
privilege of tapping and using such water mains or lines, pay in addition to
the regular tapping fee a sum equal to the special assessments charged against
comparable lots and lands bounding and abutting any such water mains and lines
or charged against lots and lands that benefit from such water mains and lines.

922.01  BACKFLOW PROTECTION.
   If, in the judgment of the Director of Public Service ("Director"), the
integrity of the public water system is, or can be, endangered by backflow from
an actual or a potential cross connection within the plumbing system of a water
consumer, the Director may order the installation of an approved backflow
prevention method or device consisting of either an air-gap, vacuum  breaker,
reduced pressure principle backflow preventer or any combination thereof at the
water service connection to the premise. The water consumer shall install the
designated device or method per the Director's Rules at their own expense, and
failure, refusal or inability to install such device or method immediately
shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premise until
such device or method has been installed and approved by the Director. The use
of the approved backflow preventer at the water service connection does not in
any way affect or eliminate the need for individual fixture devices or air-gaps
as required by the laws of the State of Ohio.
(Ord. 59-2017.  Passed 9-18-17.)
922.02   CROSS CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED
   (a)   No person shall install or maintain a water service connection to any
premises where actual or potential cross connections to a public water system
or a potable consumer's water system may exist unless such actual or potential
cross connections are abated or controlled to the satisfaction of the Director.
   (b)   No person shall install or maintain any connection whereby water from
an auxiliary water system may enter a public water system or potable consumer's
water system unless the auxiliary water system and the method of connection and
use of such system shall have been approved by the Director and by the Ohio
E.P.A. as required by Ohio R.C. 6109.13-15.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall install
or maintain a water system wherein any air gap separation distance is less than
twice the diameter of the water supply pipe or faucet or is less than one inch,
whichever is the greater distance.
(Ord. 59-2017.  Passed 9-18-17.)
922.03  SURVEYS AND INVESTIGATIONS.
   (a)   The Director, or their authorized representative, shall have the right
to enter premises served by the public water system at all reasonable times for
the purpose of making surveys and investigations of water use practices within
the premises.
   (b)   On request by the Director, or their authorized representative, the
consumer shall furnish the water purveyor, or its authorized representative,
information on water use practices within the consumer's premises.
   (c)   Subsection (a) hereof does not relieve the consumer of the
responsibility for conducting, or causing to be conducted, periodic surveys of
water use practices on their premises to determine whether there are actual or
potential cross connections in the consumer's water system through which
contaminants or pollutants could backflow into a public water system or a
potable consumer's water system.
(Ord. 59-2017.  Passed 9-18-17.)
922.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter for which another penalty is
not specifically provided shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree,

932.01  MINIMUM CONTROL MEASURES
   (a)   Public Education and Outreach on Storm Water Impacts.
      (1)   Permit Requirement.  The City has implemented a public education
program to distribute educational materials to the community or conduct
equivalent outreach activities about the impacts of storm water discharges on
water bodies and the steps the public can take to reduce pollutants in storm
water runoff.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process.
         A.   The City of Sylvania has chosen BMPs that will help educate
homeowners, students, and owners and employees of commercial facilities
including but not limited to restaurants, automobile repair and related
businesses.  The BMPs will address pollutants including pesticides and
fertilizers from home and commercial applications, used motor oil and other
vehicle fluids from home and auto repair shops, restaurant oil and grease, dry
cleaning chemicals released to the environment through improper disposal, and
pathogenic organisms from improper or illegal connections of sanitary systems
to the MS4.
         B.   The City will use a variety of means to provide educational
materials to its citizens.  Informational flyers will be available to
homeowners and businesses, the City's website will include a section on storm
water activities and information, a storm water information booth will be
available during City events, and presentations relating to storm water
activities will be made available to school, church, civic and senior citizen
groups in the community.
         C.   In addition, the City will work with the Sylvania School System
and the Lucas County Soil and Water Conservation District to provide
educational materials on water pollution and storm water runoff to students.

      (1)   Permit Requirement.  The City will comply with State and local
public notice requirements when implementing a public involvement/participation
program.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process.
         A.   The City of Sylvania has chosen BMPs that will involve the public
in their Storm Water Management Plan.  The City will hold a public meeting to
discuss the Storm Water Management Plan and provide a method to receive input
from the public.  The City will also involve school and service groups in
stream cleanup activities.  The City also intends to involve scout troops and
school science classes with the identification of storm drains.  In addition, a
storm water hotline will be implemented and its availability advertised as part
of the public education process.
         B.   By offering a range of opportunities to the public, Sylvania
hopes to actively involve a variety of people in the implementation of a number
of storm water activities.

   (c)   Illicit Discharge, Detection and Elimination.
      (1)   Permit requirement.
         A.   The City will develop, implement, and enforce a program to detect
and eliminate illicit into its MS4.
         B.   The City will develop, a GIS-based storm sewer map showing the
location of all outfalls and the names and location of all surface waters of
the State and receive discharges from those outfalls.
         C.   The City has already completed a paper copy of such map.  The
City will develop a list of all home sewage treatment systems (HSTS) connected
to discharge to your MS4 including the addresses and indicate on a storm sewer
map the location of HSTS's connected to the MS4.  The map shall include details
on the type and size of conduits/ditches in the MS4 that receive discharges
from the MSTS's, as well as the water bodies that receive discharge from its
MS4.  This information will be submitted to Ohio EPA.
         D.   The City has prohibited, through ordinance, illicit discharges
into your storm sewer system and implemented appropriate enforcement procedures
and actions.
         E.   The City has developed and implemented a plan to detect and
eliminate non-storm water discharges, including illegal dumping to its system.
         F.   The City has and will continue to inform public employees,
businesses, and the general public of hazards associated with illegal
discharges and improper disposal of waste.
         G.   The City does not consider the following categories of non-storm
water discharges to be significant contributors of pollutants to your small
MS4; water line flushing, landscape irrigation, diverted stream flows, rising
ground waters, uncontaminated ground water infiltration, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, discharges from potable water sources, foundation drains, air
conditioning condensation, irrigation water, springs, water from crawl space
pumps, footing drains, lawn watering, individual residential car washing, flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges,
street wash water, and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities (by
definition, not an illicit discharge).
      (2)   BMP Decision Process.  The City of Sylvania has identified a plan
to eliminate illicit discharges from their MS4.  The plan consists of an
ordinance with penalty provisions, a map of the system, procedures to locate
and eliminate illicit discharges and an educational component aimed at not only
the public but also businesses located within the City.  Best management
practices include a storm water hotline, educational pamphlets and displays,
and monitoring.  It is hoped that this comprehensive plan involving the
residents, business community and City personnel will facilitate the discovery
and elimination of illicit discharges from Sylvania's MS4.

   (d)   Construction Site Storm Water Runoff Control.
      (1)   Permit Requirement.  The City has developed, implemented, and
enforced a program to reduce pollutants in any storm water runoff to its MS4
from construction activities that result in a land disturbance of greater than
or equal to one acre.  Reduction of pollutants in storm water discharges from
construction activity disturbing less than one acre is included in the program
if that construction activity is part of a larger common plan of development
for sale that would disturb one acre or more.  The program includes:
         A.   An ordinance that requires erosion and sediment controls, as well
as sanctions to ensure compliance to the extent allowable under State or local
law;
         B.   Requirements for construction site operators to implement
appropriate erosion and sediment control BMPs;
         C.   Requirements for construction site operators to control waste
such as discharged building materials, concrete truck wash out, chemicals,
litter, and sanitary wastes at the construction site that might cause adverse
impacts to water quality;
         D.   Procedures for site plan review which incorporate consideration
of potential water quality impacts;
         E.   Procedures for receipt and consideration of information submitted
by the pubic; and
         F.   Procedures for site inspection and enforcement of control
measures.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process.  Sediment and erosion controls from
construction sites are important mechanisms for helping to reduce pollutants in
storm water.  The City of Sylvania's construction site runoff control program
consists of an ordinance requiring sediment and erosion controls from
construction sites as well as penalty provisions.  An inspection plan including
site review and inspection goals has been developed and existing personnel
trained in these procedures.  A storm water "hotline" has been implemented to
facilitate receiving public input.  A meeting has been held with contractors
through a collective TMACOG effort explaining the regulations and enforcement
procedures.  The City has included the construction permit, created by Ohio EPA
into Sylvania's Storm Water Management Plan.  The implementation of these
measures will help minimize the impact of sediment runoff pollution.

   (e)   Post Construction Storm Water Management in New Development and
Redevelopment.
      (1)   Permit Requirements.
         A.   The City will develop, implement and enforce a program to address
storm water runoff from new development and redevelopment projects that disturb
greater than or equal to one acre, including projects less than one acre that
are part of a larger common plan of development or sale, that discharge to its
MS4.  The program will ensure that controls are in place that would prevent or
minimize water quality impacts.
         B.   The program will develop and implement strategies which include a
combination of structural and/or non-structural BMPs appropriate for Sylvania.
         C.   The program will ensure adequate long-term operation and
maintenance of BMPs.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process.  The City of Sylvania has the unique
situation of having very little developable land.  The City is almost entirely
"built out".  Redevelopment would be the primary focus of the Post Construction
- Minimum Control Measure.  The City will prepare and adopt an ordinance
requiring control of runoff from new and redevelopment as well as penalty
provisions.  Existing regulations will be reviewed for the applicability to
this control measure.  An inspection/compliance plan will be developed to make
certain post construction requirements are being met as well as citizen
complaints are answered.  The City will host a workshop, likely in partnership
with TMACOG, for developers to explain the ordinance and inspection plan and
their long-term impact.  Zoning and sewer department personnel will be trained
on storm water runoff implications to the community.

   (f)   Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations.
      (1)   Permit Requirement.
         A.   The City has developed and implemented an operation and
maintenance program that includes a training component and has the ultimate
goal of preventing or reducing pollutant runoff from municipal operations.
         B.   Using training materials that are available from Ohio EPA or
other organizations, the program includes employee training to prevent and
reduce storm water pollution from activities such as park and open space
maintenance, fleet and building maintenance, new construction and land
disturbances and storm water system maintenance.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process.
         A.   The City of Sylvania's Divisions of Streets, Utilities and Parks
and Forestry are all subject to an operations and maintenance program designed
to prevent or reduce pollutant runoff.  The City wants to provide their
employees with information on how to best minimize the release of pollutants as
well as the benefits to the environment by these activities.  The City will
train both new and existing employees in the proper handling and disposal of
both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.  Proper maintenance and operation of
salt spreading, street sweeping and sewer cleaning vehicles will also be part
of the City's training program.
         B.   In an effort to minimize pollutant loading to the storm sewer
system the City will sweep all curbed streets and city owned parking lots four
times per year, inspect and clean if necessary, 1/4 of the storm catch basins
yearly, and inspect and clean their ditches yearly.  Those activities will be
documented and records retained.
         C.   The City currently has a used automobile and truck fluid
recycling program and a covered salt storage building.  The City currently uses
drying beds for materials removed from catch basins and ditches prior to land
filling.  The system presently used will be reviewed and changed if necessary.
         D.   A copy of the City's Anti-Litter Law is attached.  The law is
enforced and has penalty provisions.
         E.   The selection of BMPs and their impact on preventing or
minimizing pollutant runoff will be evaluated through a survey that will be
developed by the City and made available to all residents and business.  The
responses to the survey will be evaluated and recommendations made on BMP
selection.

   (a)   The City shall provide and pay for the removal and disposition of
refuse from all residents, owners, householders and buildings within the City,

prospectively and shall be made effective only on and after January 1, of any
particular year.  The City shall arrange for the distribution of special
disposable containers whereby the resident, owner or householder may dispose of
refuse in excess of the maximum container per week limit then in force, with

is imposed and paid, such persons shall be entitled to a refund of such refuse
fee upon application to the City on forms provided by the City and upon proof
of such applicant’s payment of the annual fee and verification by the Tax
Commissioner that such combined gross income, from all sources, from all

Commissioner an application for exemption form provided by the Tax Commissioner
and upon verification by the Tax Commissioner of such income received.

prior to the year for which the annual fee is imposed, of all persons residing
in a particular residence in the City during such second year prior as
determined by the Commissioner of Taxation, is equal to or exceeds the annual

and filing with the Tax Commissioner an application for exemption form provided
by the Tax Commissioner and upon verification by the Tax Commissioner of such
income tax paid or credited to have been paid.

technically feasible criteria applied in a non-discriminatory manner that
reasonably match the aesthetics and character of the immediate area regarding
all of the following, which the City shall consider in reviewing an
application:
      (1)   The location of any ground-mounted Small Cell Facilities;
      (2)   The location of a Small Cell Facility on a Wireless Support

and separate from, the Design Guidelines so long as the information, materials,
forms, or requirements do not conflict with this Chapter or other applicable
state or federal law.
   (c)   Waiver of Guidelines.  In the event that strict compliance with any
provision in these guidelines, as applied to a specific proposed Small Cell
Facility, would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless
services, the Director of Public Service may grant a limited, one-time

Right of Way, any agent, officer, director, representatives while installing,
repairing, or maintaining facilities in the Right of Way.
   (e)   Surety Bond or Equivalent Financial Tool for Cost of Removal.  All

to removal, Operator must make application to the City and receive approval for
such removal.  Operator must obtain a right of way work permit for the
removal.  The City may require the Operator to complete additional remedial
measures necessary for public safety and the integrity of the Right of Way.
      (2)   The City may, at its option, allow a Wireless Support Structure to
remain in the Right of Way and coordinate with the owner to transfer ownership
of such Wireless Support Structure to the City, instead of requiring the owner
and/or Operator to remove such Wireless Support Structure.
   (e)   Restoration.  Operator shall repair any damage to the Right of Way,
any facilities located within the Right of Way, and/or the property of any
third party resulting from Operator's removal or relocation activities (or any
other of Operator's activities hereunder) within ten (10) calendar days
following the date of such removal or relocation, at Operator's sole cost and
expense.  Restoration of the Right of Way and such property must be to
substantially the same condition as it was immediately before the date Operator

such location (even if Operator did not first obtain a Small Cell Permit). 
This includes restoration or replacement of any damaged trees, shrubs, or other
vegetation. Such repair, restoration and replacement shall be subject to the
sole, reasonable approval of the City.  (Ord.  54-2018.  Passed 1-17-19.)

      (4)   Location of exits.
      (5)   Cleaning and painting.
      (6)   Elimination of nonconforming uses of land or nonconforming signs.
      (7)   Direction and intensity of outdoor illumination.
      (8)   Off-street parking and loading.
      (9)   The duration of approval of a variance or exception, after which
such approval shall expire.
   (b)   Violations of conditions imposed by the Board in conjunction with
approval of an administrative appeal, variance, exception or industrial use
shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and punishable under
Section
1103.99.
1105.06  ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   (a)   Appeals.  The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in any administrative order, requirement, interpretation or
decision made by the Zoning Administrator in the administration and enforcement
of this Zoning Ordinance. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by an officer or bureau of the governing body of the City affected
by any decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeals shall be taken within
a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days or such lesser period as may be
provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the Zoning Administrator and
with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   (b)   Decision.  In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Zoning Ordinance,
and after the required public hearing is held, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the administrative order, requirement, interpretation or
decision appealed from and may make such administrative order, requirement,
interpretation or decision as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all
the powers of the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken.
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from, unless the administrative official from whom the
appeal is taken certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in
his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board, or by a court of record on application, on notice to the
administrative official from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown. 
1105.07  VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Board may authorize, upon appeal or written application, such
variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.
For the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, a "variance" shall be defined as a
relaxation of the terms of the Zoning Ordinance where such variance will not be
contrary to the public interest and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the
property and not the result of the actions of the applicant, a literal
enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary and undue
hardship. As used in this Zoning Ordinance, a variance is authorized only for
height, area and size of structure or size of yards and open spaces.
Establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed
by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of
nonconformities in the zoning district, or adjoining zoning districts.
(Ord. 55-2011.  Passed 7-18-11.)
   (b)   A variance from the terms of this Zoning ordinance shall not be
granted by the Board unless the required public hearing is held, and unless and
until all of the following findings are made by the Board:
      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other
properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
      (4)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Ordinance to the owners of
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
      (5)   The variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
   And after considering the above, the Board thereafter finds that:
      (6)   The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance, will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, will not impair the adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property, will not unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, will
not unreasonably diminish property values within the surrounding area or
otherwise be detrimental to the public interest.
         (Ord. 64-2011.  Passed 9-19-11.) 
1105.08  EXCEPTIONS.
   The Board may hear and approve exceptions as specifically authorized herein,
which are in harmony with the purposes and intent of this Zoning Ordinance, and
which will not adversely affect the public interest. The following exceptions
may be granted by the Board, after written application is submitted therefore,
and after the required public hearing is held:
   (a)   The location of a temporary building for commerce or industry in a
residence district which is incidental to the residential development, such
permit to be issued for a period of not more than one year.
   (b)   The location of a temporary sign pertaining to the development of the
land upon which the sign is located, provided it is not located in a required
front yard, such permit to be issued for a period of not more than one year.
   (c)   The enlargement, erection and use of a building or the use of premises
in any location for a railroad or other public utility purposes not otherwise
allowed by this Zoning Ordinance, which the Board deems reasonably necessary
for the public convenience or welfare.
   (d)   A reduction of the parking and loading requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance whenever it has been clearly demonstrated that the provision of the
full parking or loading facilities is unnecessary, or where such a requirement
would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted
with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
   (e)   The placement of required parking spaces on a parcel separated from
the parcel upon which the building or use served by such parking spaces is
located, provided that the parking spaces are sufficiently close enough that
they will serve the intended purpose and provided a written agreement assuring
the retention of the parking spaces is properly executed and filed with the
application for a zoning certificate.
   (f)   The waiver of yards or setbacks and screening required for a parking
area adjacent to a residential district, whenever a wall of approved height,
design and material is erected.
   (g)   Within any district, the placing of more than one main building on a
lot, when all of the buildings are intended to be operated as a single
enterprise and the lot and all portions of it are owned, leased or under option
by a single party.  In such cases, the yard requirements shall apply along all
edges of the lot, but shall not be required for the internal arrangement of the
buildings on the lot, provided that adequate light and air will reach all
habitable rooms.  Height, bulk and lot area per family shall apply as in the
case of one main building located on a lot. An application for the placing of
more than one main building on a lot shall be accompanied by a Site Plan.
Proposals for placing more than one residential main building on a lot shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for review of the Site Plan, and Planning
Commission approval of the Site Plan shall be prerequisite to final approval by
the Board.
   (h)   The waiver of screening required in front of parking areas across a
street from a residentially zoned parcel. 
1105.09  INDUSTRIAL USES.
   The Board shall hear and approve or disapprove proposals for location of
industrial uses in the M-1 Light Industrial District when there is a question
concerning the expected performance of the use, according to Section
1145.06(s) and also proposals for location of certain industrial uses in the M-
2 Heavy Industrial District which, because of their performance, need special
consideration according to Section
1147.07. Written application shall be made to the Board or referral shall be
made by the Zoning Administrator, the public hearing shall be held, and the
applicant or his agent shall appear before the Board with drawings of the
proposed use and with other evidence, such as expert engineering testimony, to
indicate the expected performance of the proposed use. In addition, the Board
may accept written or oral testimony from other experts and from the staff of
the Board of Health, the Service Director or other governmental or private
agencies. In considering the proposed use, the Board shall evaluate the effect
on adjacent neighborhoods, other businesses and industries from the possible
emission of vibrations, noise, light, smoke, fumes, odor or dust.

1109.01  SITE PLAN REQUIRED.
   (a)   Site Plans are required when construction projects involve individual
buildings on individual sites, and when the proposed construction, alteration,
relocation, or change of use involves any of the following elements:
      (1)   The proposed land use involves a Special Use in the zoning
district.
      (2)   The development involves construction of five (5) or more new or
additional parking spaces in off-street parking areas.   
      (3)   The construction of any number of housing units in a multifamily
structure(s). 
      (4)   The construction of a new industrial building, or the expansion of
an existing industrial structure by more than 5,000 square feet of gross floor
area.
      (5)   The construction, or expansion, of a commercial, office or public
building that involves more than 5,000 square feet of gross floor area. 
      (6)   Any proposed development that involves the preparation of a Traffic
Impact Study pursuant to Chapter
1110.
   (b)   Site Plans may be approved administratively unless any of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   The proposed development involves a Special Use pursuant to Chapter
1153.
      (2)   The proposed development involves the need for a variance pursuant
to Section
1105.07.
      (3)   The proposed development is located within an Overlay District that
requires design review approval.
      (4)   The proposed development involves the need to prepare a Traffic
Impact Study pursuant to Chapter
1110.
   (c)   In such instances, other associated procedures and review requirements
shall be followed. 
1109.02  SITE PLAN SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS, IN GENERAL.
   The purpose of Site Plan review procedures is to provide a mechanism to
review proposed construction projects with potentially greater impacts upon the
community, ensure compliance with development standards and aid in the
implementation of land use planning policies.  Applicants have the option of
requesting that the submittal of one or more of the required elements of a Site
Plan be deferred.  The request to defer is made by the applicant and the
decision to grant this request rests with the Service Director or his/her
designee.  Before any Site Plan is approved all of the required elements must
be submitted before a decision is rendered.  The applicant may also request a
two-step Site Plan review and seek preliminary approval of a Site Plan without
a full submittal of all required material.  The request for a two step review
process is made by the applicant and the Service Director or his/her designee. 
The Planning Commission and/or City Council may take action on an incomplete
Site Plan as deemed appropriate to offer guidance toward full approval.  A
preliminary approval of a Site Plan does not guarantee final approval.
1109.03  SITE PLANS AND VARIANCES.
   If a proposed Site Plan includes a request for a variance, such variance
must first be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
1109.04  SITE PLAN SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Site Plans shall meet the following requirements:
   (a)   All Site Plan drawings shall be prepared by a professional engineer or
architect and shall bear their professional seal, unless it is determined by
the Service Director or his/her designee, that due to the simplicity of the
project, a professional seal is not required at this stage of the project
development.  The Service Director or his/her designee may also waive any
submission requirement by determining that such information is not needed or
relevant to making a determination regarding compliance with requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance. 
   (b)   The cover letter shall indicate the applicant name, address, and phone
number; the owner name, address, and telephone number; and provide an overview
of the project being proposed.
   (c)   Site Plan drawings should include the following information:
      (1)   Name, address, telephone number and State of Ohio registration

proposed features.
      (10)   Format.  Site plan drawings shall be submitted in a hard copy
format on 11" x 17" or 24" x 36" paper (plan sizes greater than 24" x 36" in
size shall not be excepted), or in an electronic media format acceptable to the
Zoning Administrator. 
      (11)   Legal features:  A property boundary line survey, as surveyed by a
registered surveyor, showing bearings and distances including the geometric
layout of the site showing complete dimensions of existing and proposed
buildings, roads, drives, parking areas, utilities, landscaping and other site

1109.05  ACTION ON SITE PLANS.
   Unless the proposed development is reviewed by the Planning Commission and/
or City Council, the Service Director or his/her designee shall take one of the
following actions:   
   (a)   Approval - An officially approved Site Plan shall expire within one
(1) year of its date of approval, unless a longer period of completion is
granted along with such original approval.  Extensions may also be granted upon
petition of the applicant when an original period of approval expires.

consider a Design Plan, Site Plan and Special Use.  If a proposed development
involves a Special Use, the Special Use Approval Procedures Defined in Chapter
1153 shall be followed and the Planning Commission shall offer consideration
and a report to the Sylvania City Council in terms of both Site Plan Review and
Special Use Approval.     
1109.08  SITE PLAN COMPLIANCE.
   After a Site Plan has been approved, no zoning certificate may be issued by
the Service Director or his/her designee, except in compliance with such
approved Site Plan. 
1109.09  AMENDMENTS TO APPROVED SITE PLANS. 
   Amendments to approved Site Plans may be made in the same manner as an
original Site Plan approval except that an applicant need not resubmit
information that has already been submitted as part of a previous Site Plan
review process.   
1109.10  SITE PLAN REVIEW CRITERIA. 
   All Site Plans shall be reviewed on the basis of uniform criteria that
advance the principals of good site design to provide safe vehicular access and
pedestrian movement.  Site plans shall also be reviewed on the basis of
achieving site designs that will promote a healthy natural and built
environment for residents and will advance principles defined in applicable
community planning documents and this Zoning Code.  Specific approval criteria
include the following:
   (a)   The Site Plan shall show (consistent with the findings of a Traffic
Impact Study if included) that a proper relationship will exist between
thoroughfares, service roads, driveways, sidewalks, bike lanes and parking
areas to encourage pedestrian, bicyclist and vehicular traffic safety on both
public and private lands.
   (b)   All development features, including the principal buildings, open
spaces, service roads, driveways and parking areas, shall be so located and
related as to minimize the possibility of adverse effects upon adjacent
development.
   (c)   Building location and placement shall be developed with consideration
given to minimizing removal of large trees (in accordance with change of
topography).
   (d)   Visual and auditory privacy for surrounding properties and occupants
shall be provided through the design of the relationship among buildings,
fences and walls, landscaping, topography, and open space.
   (e)   Parking area landscaping and screening shall channel traffic flow in a
safe manner, and on-site traffic circulation shall be designed to provide
adequate access for fire and police protection, and minimize interference with
the traffic carrying capacity of adjacent streets.
   (f)   Refuse storage and pick-up facilities shall be indicated on the Site
Plan and shall be fenced, screened, or landscaped to prevent blowing or
scattering of refuse, and to provide an adequate visual barrier from locations
both on- and off-site.
   (g)   All utilities on-site shall be located underground.
   (h)   Grading and surface drainage provisions shall be designed to minimize
adverse effects on abutting properties, streams, and public streets, and to
minimize the possibility of erosion in a manner consistent with the
requirements of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3).
   (i)   The design and construction standards of all private roads, driveways,
and parking areas, shall conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code and/or
as may be recommended through engineering review.  All private streets,
driveways, and parking areas are to be of a useable shape and improved with
asphalt, concrete, or other durable and dustless pavement or surface.
   (j)   The design of the site and physical structures advances applicable
community planning principles expressed in the Sylvania Land Use Plan and any
area or neighborhood-specific planning documents. 
1109.11  DEVELOPMENT PLAN REQUIRED.
   Development Plans are required when projects involve multiple buildings on
multiple sites, common ownership of property within a proposed development and
the allocation of private or public open spaces.  Development Plans are also
required when development activity will be phased in over time.    Development
Plans are specifically required for all Planned Developments proposed pursuant
to Chapter
1155 and may be required in the B-4 District where multiple properties are
involved or the project is proposed to be phased in. 
1109.12  DEVELOPMENT PLAN SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS, IN GENERAL.
   Development Plans shall include all applicable elements required for Site
Plans as related to areas that will be developed in an initial phase.    When
Development Plans involve future development phases and specific uses are
unknown, some required Site Plan elements may be waived, but the applicant
shall provide the following additional requirements: 
   (a)   The location of building footprints or envelopes within which dwelling
units are to be constructed in later development phases.    Future building

1110.01  PURPOSE.
   These access management regulations are intended to provide for efficient
access to and from property and to maintain a safe level of service on all
roads and highways in the City of Sylvania.    It is further the purpose of
these regulations to ensure that new development or redevelopment generating
significant vehicular trips occurs with careful consideration as to how to
balance access needs with the need to maintain the capacity of existing
roadways to carry existing and future traffic volumes.   
1110.02  REQUIREMENTS - ACCESS MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   An Access Management Plan shall accompany any Site Plan submitted pursuant
to Chapter
1109.  This Access Management Plan shall illustrate proposed and/or existing
driveways, parking areas, and drive aisles, along with road details, such as
public right-of-way, vehicular traffic lanes, bike lanes, traffic signal
locations and traffic control signs, such as "STOP" and "YIELD," along with
anticipated daily and peak hour traffic volumes at site access points.   
1110.03  REQUIREMENTS - TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   A Traffic Impact Study shall accompany any Site Plan submitted pursuant to
Chapter
1109, when any development, expansion, or change of use is proposed and
generates one hundred (100) or more peak hour trips (as defined by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual).  This
Traffic Impact Study shall document the development's impact on internal and
external vehicular and pedestrian circulation and safety.  Based on the
findings and recommendations of the Traffic Impact Study, an access drive,
shared driveway approach for adjoining parcels, signal improvements, pedestrian
walks, bike lanes, turn lanes, and limited direction driveways may be required
as part of Site Plan approval.
1110.04  TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY - CONTENT. 
   The Traffic Impact Study shall be prepared by a Professional Engineer at the
expense of the property owner or developer and include all elements of an
Access Management Plan. The study shall also investigate and recommend the
feasibility and benefits of improvements such as signals, turn lanes, driveway
movement limitations to protect the safety and welfare of the traveling
public.  The Traffic Impact Study analysis shall include descriptions for the
following:
   (a)   Site and area within limits of the traffic impacts. 
   (b)   Roadway network within the limits of the traffic impact area; the
proposed site, adjacent roadway and the nearest major intersection in each
direction; shall include traffic volumes, levels of service, and physical
features such as number and type of lanes and traffic control devices.
   (c)   Existing development adjacent to and surrounding the subject site and
a description of future development as proposed by the Sylvania Land Use Plan.
   (d)   Trip generation consistent with the current ITE Trip Generation and
distribution, including a description of all assumptions/predictions used to
generate findings of trip distribution.
   (e)   Projected future traffic conditions within limits of the traffic
impacts, including opening day of proposed development; ten (10) year and
twenty (20) year projections.
   (f)   Evaluation of the effects the proposed development will have on the
existing level of service for site driveways, public rights-of-way, roadways
and adjacent intersections in each direction including traffic volumes.
   (g)   Recommendations for site access and transportation improvements needed
to mitigate site-generated traffic within the limits of the traffic impacts, to
at least the level of service that currently exists.
   (h)   Signal warrant analysis and highway capacity analysis shall be
conducted, consistent with the current Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (OMUTCD) and Transportation Research Boards (TRB), Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) and associated software, at all multi-movement driveways. 
Determination of a signal installation will be based on the signal warrant
analyses with consideration for system capability and signal spacing.
   (i)   When questions arise concerning the development of Access management
and Traffic Impact Studies, Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) standards
shall provide guidance.
1110.05  REVIEW ELEMENTS.
   Review of Access Management and Traffic Impact Studies shall include
consideration of:
   (a)   The potential for existing or future access drives (front or rear)
   (b)   The need for reciprocal easement agreements (on-site only)
   (c)   Adequacy of proposed driveway geometry serving proposed development
   (d)   Limitation on the number of driveways
   (e)   Necessary turn lane improvements
   (f)   Limited left/right turn direction driveways
   (g)   Restricted left/right turn
   (h)   Reduction/elimination/shared driveways
   (i)   Road/drive alignment (including alignments with drives and roads on
opposite sides of the street or road. 
   (j)   Traffic control devices associated with site access
   (k)   Right turn deceleration lanes
   
1110.06  ACCESS DRIVES.
   (a)   The preferred type of access to a lot is a drive that is located in
the rear of a property and which connects adjoining parcels. In those instances
where a rear access drive is not feasible, a front access drive to connect
adjoining parcels may be considered.  An access drive may be a publicly
dedicated right-of-way, constructed at the owner's expense and built to City of
Sylvania standards. If a private access road is proposed, requirements such as
curbing, width of rights-of-way, and road width may be modified or approved by
the Service Director or his/her designee.  If a private access road is
permitted pursuant to this Section, reciprocal easement agreements between
adjoining parcels are required. 
   (b)   The distance between the adjacent road and an access drive shall be
subject to the recommendations of a Traffic Study that addresses local
conditions and considerations.  When a front access drive is permitted, the
required landscape area may be located between the existing roadway and the
front access drive.  The access drive shall be constructed before any occupancy
or use is permitted.  A bond, escrow or other assurance may be provided to
guarantee the completion of the access drive. Where access drives are not
appropriate, driveway sharing and/or cross access between parking areas of
adjacent parcels may be approved.
1110.07  CURB CUTS, SIGNALS.
   As part of the Site Plan review process, The Service Director or his/her
designee may approve a Site Plan with a specific driveway location on condition
that an agreement be made between the property owner and the City requiring
that such driveway(s) be closed when specific conditions are met.  Such
conditions may include the completion of an access drive or shared drive
approach on adjacent lots or for other road specific circumstance.  When public
roadway improvements are required by a proposed development such as the
construction of left or right turn lanes or installation of traffic signals,
completion of such improvements shall be assured by the owner by posting a bond
or escrow.

1125.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a location for residential
dwellings having two or more separate dwelling units per individual structure
including two-family dwellings, townhouses, apartments, garden apartments and
motel apartments. The R-3 District is medium density in terms of dwelling units
per acre. Open space requirements provide substantial play and recreation
areas.
1125.02  LOCATION.
   The boundaries of the R-3 District are shown on the Official Zoning Map.  R-
3 zoning is generally located in relation to the following urban facilities and
services:
   (a)   Collector or arterial streets;
   (b)   Public transportation;
   (c)   Shopping facilities;
   (d)   Schools;
   (e)   Parks and recreation areas;
   (f)   Public sewer and water facilities; and
   (g)   Police and fire protection.
   The moderate population density of this R -3 District and the limited
elevation of structures therein tend to make such District reasonably
compatible with single-family and lesser density two-family residential areas,
and such District can be located in close proximity thereto under good design
principles. The R-3 District is also especially suited as a transition between
lesser density residential areas such as single-family and two-family
residential areas and those areas having medium high density multiple-family
dwellings or commercial activities.

total area of such lot used for buildings. There shall be not less than 2. 3
square feet of open space for each square foot of floor area.
      Floor area x 2.3 = minimum open space (square feet)
1125.07  LIVABILITY SPACE.
   Livability space is that part of the open space as hereinabove defined
remaining after excluding therefrom the nonenclosed space for vehicular parking
and vehicular movement. There shall be not less than 1. 3 square feet of
livability space for each square foot of floor area.
      Floor area x 1.3 = minimum livability space (square feet)
1125.08  MAXIMUM HEIGHT.

1127.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a location for multiple-family
apartment structures having a greater dwelling unit density than is permitted
in the R-3 District including duplexes, townhouses, apartments, garden
apartments, motel apartments and other residential multi-story construction.
The R-4 District is medium high density in terms of dwelling units per acre.
Open space requirements provide limited play and recreation areas.
1127.02  LOCATION.

   (d)   Schools;
   (e)   Parks and recreation areas;
   (f)   Public sewer and water facilities; and
   (g)   Police and fire protection.
   Due to the substantially greater intensity of land use, and also to the
greater permitted heights of the building structures, the R-4 District is
generally noncompatible with single-family and two-family residential areas.
The R-4 District is compatible with R-3 Multiple Dwelling Districts and the
several commercial districts.

actions do not involve the provision of additional parking or other exterior
building modifications other than signage. 
1141.05  REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Floor to Area Ratio:    The maximum Floor to Area Ratio shall be 1.5
for mixed-use buildings and 1.0 for all other buildings. 
   (b)   Building Setbacks and Heights:    No interior side setbacks are
required in the B-4 District, except when B-4 zoned property abuts property in

4 district shall be the same as required for the adjacent zoning district.   
The maximum building height shall be 45 feet.
   (c)   Residential Density:   The maximum residential density is 15 dwelling
units per acre.   
1141.06  DESIGN STANDARDS.   
   More specific design standards may be developed by the City of Sylvania to
augment planning polices expressed in the Land Use Plan and this Zoning
Ordinance.  At a minimum, both individual Site Plans and Development Plans
shall advance the following development standards.
   (a)   Architectural Design:
      (1)   The architectural features and treatments on a building shall not
be restricted to a single facade. All sides of a building open to view by the
public, whether viewed from public or private property, shall display a similar
level of quality and architectural interest.  Architectural features such as
windows, awnings, projections, reveals, changes in pattern, and trellises
should be used on all sides for visual interest.
      (2)   The first floor of all buildings should provide for a pedestrian-
friendly environment, with human-scale and natural building materials;
extensive storefront windows for display and views into the business; and
access directly from adjacent sidewalks. When transparency is in conflict with
internal functions of the building, other means should be used to activate the
street facing facades such as public art, architectural ornamentation or
details, or color patterns. 
      (3)   Architectural scaling elements, such as banding, belt coursing,
sills, lintels, mullions, and changes in texture, material module and pattern,
should be used to break down the appearance of large building forms.  Building
facades should include a combination of details to enhance the architectural
interest. 
      (4)   Exterior walls greater than 40 feet in length should break any
flat, monolithic façade with discernible architectural elements.  Building
facades oriented to the street or public space should provide architectural
variety and scale by incorporating elements such as bay windows, recessed
entrances and windows, display windows, balconies, cornices, columns, vertical
plane breaks, and other types of architectural detailing to provide visual
interest   
      (5)   Building designs should provide varied rooflines in order to create
interesting skylines are encouraged.  Roof shapes should be an integral part of
the building architecture and create interesting and varied appearances. Sloped
roof forms are encouraged to be a minimum of 6/12 pitch.  Design elements for
flat roof buildings should include parapets with variable height and/or changes
in setback. 
      (6)   Exterior building facades should exhibit high levels of design,
detailing, and material quality. A mix of quality, compatible materials is
strongly encouraged on all facades facing streets, or other public spaces or
areas.  Buildings should be constructed of combinations of durable, high-
quality materials such as: brick, stone, architectural pre-cast concrete,
architecturally cast concrete, cast stone, integrally colored split or ground
face concrete masonry units, terra-cotta, stucco or EIFS (exterior insulated
finishing system), architectural metal, or any combination of the materials
listed.
   (b)   Parking.
      (1)   Shared parking is permitted and is encouraged, subject to approval
of a shared parking study. Parking requirements may be met on-site, or at a
distance of up to 300 feet from the subject use. 
      (2)   At least 10 percent of the area of surface parking lots shall
include trees and shrubs surface parking areas should also use landscaping and
pedestrian walkways to divide the lot into smaller modules.   
      (3)   On-site street and parking areas shall be lit with full cutoff type
lighting fixtures no more than 25 feet tall.  Parking lot lighting should be
integrated into landscape islands wherever possible, should minimize light
trespass and glare, and should be compatible with the overall design of the
associated project.
   (c)   Lighting.
      (1)   Private sidewalks, internal pedestrian paths, and bicycle paths
shall be lit with full cutoff lighting fixtures no more than 16 feet tall and
providing consistent illumination.  Pedestrian area lighting should be human-
scaled and also reflect the overall character or design of the project to which
it is associated. 
      (2)   Building lighting should be full cutoff fixtures and should reflect
the architectural characteristics of the overall building.  Building lighting
should complement the overall building architecture in design and nighttime
illumination. Building lighting should primarily be used to light pedestrian
ways adjacent to the building.
1141.07  FACADE LIGHTING.
   Illuminated tubing shall be permitted in B-4 Shopping Center District. 
Provided, however, that such illuminated tubing shall not be permitted on a
facade that faces a bordering residential zoning classification.  (Ord. 25-
2013.  Passed 5-6-13.)

1143.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a location for office, retail and
residential district including multiple-family apartment structures having a
greater dwelling unit density than is permitted in other residential zoning
classifications including duplexes, townhouses, apartments, and other
residential multi-story construction.  The design of the structures and
permitted uses will generally tend to make the B-5 District compatible with R-
3, R-4 Districts and all B districts.  The B-5 District is high density in
terms of dwelling units per acre.
(Ord. 27-2017.  Passed 6-5-17.)
1143.02   LOCATION.
   The B-5 District should generally be located in relation to the following
urban facilities and services:
   (a)   Collector or arterial streets;
   (b)   Public transportation;
   (c)   Shopping facilities;
   (d)   Schools;
   (e)   Parks and Recreation Areas;
   (f)   Public sewer and water facilities;
   (g)   Police and fire protection; and
   (h)   Contiguous to a B zoned property.
   Due to the substantially greater intensity of land use, and also to the
greater permitted
heights of the building structures, the B-5 District is generally incompatible
with single-family and two-family residential areas.  The B-5 District is
compatible with R-3 Multiple Dwelling Districts, R-4 Multiple Dwelling Medium
High Density District and the several B districts.

1149.001 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Sylvania has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
         generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (c)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
         (Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)
   (d)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Lucas County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Study for Lucas County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
both effective March 15, 2016 and any revisions thereto hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this section.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Sylvania as required by Section
1149.36(d) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 6730 Monroe Street, Sylvania, OH  43560.  (Ord. 14-
2016.  Passed 3-7-16.)
   (e)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (f)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.

1149.01  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined herein, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

year) flood elevation” (BFE)) means the water surface elevation of the base
flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually
expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  In Zone AO areas, the base flood
elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3
feet).
      (Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)

together with all floors, and any openings in such walls or floors, sited at an
elevation below the regulatory flood protection elevation, shall be made
watertight and impermeable to passage of water, whether flood water or waste
water backup, promoted by flood-related causes. Further, such walls and floors
shall be designed and constructed with sufficient structural strength to resist
the combined hydrostatic, hydrodynamic and buoyant stresses resulting from the
base flood without suffering structural damage, either internally or
externally.
   (j)   Elevations. All elevations are expressed in terms of feet above mean
sea level.
   (k)   "Existing construction" means any structure, or substantial
improvement thereto, either completed or in the process of active construction
upon the date of the initial City of Sylvania Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
   (l)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency" (FEMA) means the agency with the

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (q)       “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
      (Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)

11.)
   (u)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A  "Exhibit B-1" floodway is typically determined through a
hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase
in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a
designated height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one
foot at any point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous
area, and is usually characterized by any of the following:  Moderate to high
velocity flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and
moderate to high erosion forces.
      (Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)
   (v)   "Floodway fringe" means that portion of the flood plain outside of the
floodway which may be completely obstructed without increasing the base flood
water surface elevation by more than one foot at any point on the flood plain.
   (w)   "Floodway Fringe District" (FF) means that District commencing at the
extreme edge of the Floodway District and extending laterally across the flood
plain, encompassing that portion of the flood plain that could be completely

or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park.  A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.

of the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or

   (ss)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (tt)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" are Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of the
community.  Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   "Zone A" means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   "Zones A1-30 and Zone AE" mean special flood hazard areas inundated
by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   "Zone AO" means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   "Zone AH" means special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood

the 500-year floodplain.
   (uu)   "Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)" means the Flood Protection
Elevation, or  FPE, is the base flood elevation.  In areas where no base flood
elevations exist  from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (vv)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above
a flood level  for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to
compensate for  the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (ww)   "Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis" means an analysis
performed  by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.

letter, to  Amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and  Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.  LOMCs are broken down into
the  following categories:
      (1)   "Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)" means a revision based on
technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special
flood hazard area.
      (2)   "Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)" means a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   "Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)" means a formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (yy)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" is a Federal program
enabling  property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection  against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to
provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating
costs of repairing damage  to building and their contents caused by floods. 
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (zz)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to

1149.001(d) including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
Sylvania.
(Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)
1149.03  COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations,
unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in
Section
1149.151.
   (b)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a violation
of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with Section
1149.99.
 
   (c)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1149.99.
(Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)
1149.04  FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY.
   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
"Flood Insurance Study, Lucas County, Ohio and Incorporated Communities". This
study, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated October 6,2000, and
any revisions thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of this section.
1149.05  BASE FLOOD WATER SURFACE ELEVATIONS.
   Pursuant to Sections 1917.3 and 1917.4 of Title 24, Code of Federal
Regulations, the base flood water surface elevations for those streams and the

FR 56951 on December 30, 1976, are adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this Chapter.
1149.06  FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The flood protection elevation shall be set at an elevation which is not
less than two feet above the base flood water surface elevation. It is the
minimum elevation to which uses regulated by this Chapter are required to be
elevated or floodproofed. The purpose of this flood protection elevation is to
provide a reasonable margin of safety to allow for possible increases in the
base flood water surface elevation, resulting from factors such as ice jams and
urbanization.
1149.07  ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   The special flood hazard areas (flood plains) within the jurisdiction of
this Chapter are hereby divided into the three following zoning districts: a
Floodway District (FW), a Floodway Fringe District (FF) and a Limited Special
Flood Hazard District (LSD). The boundaries of these three districts shall be
shown on the current Official Zoning Maps. Within these districts all uses not
allowed as permitted uses shall be prohibited. 
1149.08  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sylvania, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)

   (a)   Composition. The Floodway District shall include all those lands
comprising the floodway, as delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. By
definition, the floodway includes the channel of a stream, plus any adjacent
floodplain areas that must be kept free of encroachment, in order that the 100
year flood may be discharged without substantially increasing the base flood
water surface elevation at any point in the floodplain or contributing to
hazardous flow velocities.
   (b)   Use Standards.
      (1)   Lands comprising the Floodway District shall not be developed nor
encumbered in any manner which will cause or contribute to an increase in the
base flood water surface elevation at any point within the flood plain.
Further, no development shall be permitted which will induce a current flow
velocity during the base flood exceeding that set forth in Table 2 of the Flood
Insurance Study, City of Sylvania, for the nearest listed reference location.
      (2)   The bed or floor of the stream channel of a floodway may not be

existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section

description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
Variance Application Fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the City of
Sylvania.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1149.31 (d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
(7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the attendance
of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and service
shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lucas Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)
1149.32  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of this Chapter be declared by the courts to
be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the Chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to
be unconstitutional or invalid.
1149.33  CHANGE IN WATERCOURSE.
   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered
if any change occurs within its banks.
1149.34  ALTERATION OF COMMUNITY BOUNDARIES.
   Upon occurrence, notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City's Flood Insurance
Rate Map accurately represent the City of Sylvania's boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction,
clearly delineating the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority. 
1149.35  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind,
heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator
shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the  floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, 
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

highest adjacent natural grade. Where flood protection elevation data are not
available, the structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent natural grade.
   (g)   Accessory Structures.  Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures containing no more than 600
square feet. Such structures must meet the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;

   (j)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways. 
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1149.221 (a);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Sylvania and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1149.36(j)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Sylvania specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1149.221 (a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 75-2011.  Passed 8-15-11.)
1149.99  PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense, and
shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations
or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof
be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the City of Sylvania. Each
day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the City of Sylvania from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City of
Sylvania shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with

1153.01  PURPOSE.
   Most types of land use covered by this Zoning Ordinance are grouped
according to compatibility and function, and each group is permitted outright
in one or more of the various districts established in the Ordinance. In
addition to these permitted uses, there are other uses which it may be
necessary or desirable to allow in certain districts, but because of their
potential impact on adjacent land or public facilities, need particular and
individual consideration prior to location in the community. Such uses are
classified in this Zoning Ordinance as Special Uses and fall into two general
categories:
   (a)   Uses municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated utilities,
and uses traditionally affected by public interest.
   (b)   Uses entirely private in character which, because of their peculiar
locational needs or the nature of the service they offer to the public, may
have to be established in a district in which they cannot reasonably be allowed
as a permitted use under the zoning regulations.
1153.02  SPECIAL USES.
   Council shall have authority to permit, by ordinance, the following uses of
land or structures in any district, except as herein qualified and subject to
the conditions and procedures set forth herein:

business or industrial zoning district, according to the additional procedures
and conditions of Chapter
1157.
   (r)   Mobile or manufactured home parks in R-3, R-4, B-1 and B-2 Districts
   (s)   Automobile service stations in the B-1, B-2, B-3 and B-4 Districts.
Gasoline pumps and pump islands which are more than fifty feet from the
boundary of a residential zoning district may be located within a required
yard, provided they are more than fifteen feet from any street line.
   (t)   A charitable or public service organization chartered as a nonprofit
corporation or organization by the State in any R District any B-I District or
B-2 District.  Any such facility located within any R District shall not

site and shall be set back from any required yard at least two such feet for
each foot of height of that structure located nearest such line.
   (u)   Commercial motor truck terminal, truck repair station and/or garage
and commercial parking lots and/or parking garage for commercial trucks
exceeding 7,000 pounds net weight.
   (v)   Commercially operated transmission pipelines, located either above or
below ground surface, and used for transferring such substances as:
      (1)   Petroleum derived substances;
      (2)   All other types of liquid organic substances;
      (3)   All types of liquefied gases;
      (4)   All noxious gases such as ammonia, chlorine, benzene, etc.;
      (5)   Coal slurries;
      (6)   Any substance having a pH of 3.0 or lower;
      (7)   Any substance having a pH of 12.0 or higher.
Excluded are local service lines installed to distribute natural gas to

   (w)   Sexually-oriented businesses subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   A sexually-oriented use shall not be permitted in any Zoning
District other than the B-3 Central Business District.   
      (2)   Because of relevant studies of sexually-oriented businesses which
document the potential harmful secondary effects of sexually-oriented
businesses, separation distances between sexually-oriented businesses and other
sensitive land uses are deemed necessary.  Secondary effects studies include
those produced in many cities and states and cite the incidence of crime, and
the adverse impacts on property values.  Also, of concern is the potential that
children could be exposed to sexually-oriented material.  As a result of these
considerations, a sexually-oriented business establishment shall not be located
within 250 feet of any property that is zoned as a residential district (R-1,
R-1-A, R-2, R-2-A, R-3, R-4), or from any property line associated with a
publicly-owned park.    Further, a sexually-oriented business may not locate
within, 500 feet of the property line of an educational facility (elementary
school, junior high school, high school, nursery school or preschool,
vocational or trade school), place of religious worship or public library.  A
sexually-oriented business establishment shall also not be located within 1,000
feet of another existing sexually-oriented business establishment.  All
measurements referenced herein shall be made in a straight line, without regard
to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion of the building
or structure where a sexually-oriented business establishment exists (or is
proposed to be established), to the nearest property line of the specific uses
referenced herein.  For leased spaces in multi-tenant and/or multi-level
properties, the measurements shall be from the outer boundaries of the entire
building (projected to ground level, if applicable). 
      (3)   No person shall knowingly allow a person less than 18 years of age
on the premises of a sexually-oriented business. 
      (4)   A sexually-oriented business which features persons who appear in a
state of nudity or semi-nudity or live performances, shall not allow a patron
to have any physical contact with any entertainer on the premises during any
performance.
      (5)   Operations at any such center or establishment may not be conducted
between hours of 2:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m local time. 
      (6)   No personnel at any such center or establishment involved in nude
entertainment activities shall be permitted to prepare, handle or serve any
food or beverage;

1155.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to make this Zoning Ordinance flexible in
relation to new development ideas and changing conditions by providing a means
for considering and approving new and creative developments which do not meet
the exact requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, but which do meet the general
purposes of the Ordinance and are not detrimental to the community.  The
Planned Development (PD) is a voluntary procedure that provides an overlay
zoning district that encourages innovative urban and architectural design,
conservation of significant natural features or consolidation of open space in
order to provide for a mixture of uses with an open space in order to provide
for a mixture of uses with an integrated design. 
1155.02  DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION.
   A Planned Development is a tract of land which is planned to be developed by
the owner or owners thereof, and which comprises an area of one or more net
acres.  The Planned Development may be a residential, commercial, or industrial
development or may be a combination of uses with no minimum site area
required.  All planned developments shall be platted in accordance with
applicable subdivision rules and regulations. 
1155.03  PROCEDURE.
   Applications for planned developments and the procedures for consideration
and approval shall be the same as for Special Uses as described in Chapter
1153.    All PD applications shall include a Development Plan prepared in
accordance with Chapter
1109.    Additional information may also be required to adequately review the
proposed development, including environmental assessments and other studies for
the development.  The expense of providing this information is the
responsibility of the applicant. 
1155.04  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Dwelling units may be any single or combination of single family, zero lot
line, attached house, duplex, or multi-family housing unit.    Housing density
may not exceed permitted densities applicable to the existing zoning district
by more than one and one half times.  Residential areas to be developed
adjacent to existing residential areas shall be developed with comparable
housing types and at comparable densities. 
1155.05  DESIGN.
   The applicant for PD approval is encouraged to demonstrate excellence in
architectural and site design.  Specific development standards are
intentionally broad and general to allow maximum flexibility and creativity. 
It is anticipated that applicants for PD approval will utilize this flexibility
to enable the creation of highly attractive and functional urban spaces.  The
architectural design and materials must however, be compatible with surrounding
and internal development.    Developers are encouraged to identify local
historic elements to build upon in the design process to help create an
authentic sense of place and interest.    The PD should also advance design
concepts that incorporates motorized and non-motorized travel and creates
functional and attractive mobility choices.    Sidewalks or other approved non-
motorized transportation facilities should be provided to link nonresidential
areas with residential areas, both inside and outside the PD.   
1155.06  AMENDMENTS / CHANGES.
   All amendments to approved and existing Planned Development applications
require full review and approval in accordance with the original approval
procedures.

CHAPTER 1160
Landscaping
1160.01   Purpose.
1160.02   Landscaping for vehicular use areas.
1160.03   Landscaping for service structures.
1160.04   Vegetated buffers and screening.
1160.05   Plant materials.
1160.06   Landscaping plan.
1160.07   General requirements for submission of  landscaping plan.
 
 
1160.01  PURPOSE. 
   The purpose of these regulations are to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare of residents by establishing minimum standards for the
maintenance of existing natural amenities, and design and installation of
landscape improvements.  Landscaping is a critical element of the physical
environment contributing to development quality and compatibility between land
uses by reducing negative physical, visual, noise, and lighting impacts. 
1160.02  LANDSCAPING FOR VEHICULAR USE AREAS. 
   Landscaping within parking areas, whether ground cover or upright plant
material, is necessary not only to reduce the generation of heat and water
runoff, but to break up, visually, the expanse of paved areas.  The use of
parking islands or peninsulas strategically placed throughout the parking lot
is required to landscape parking lot interiors. The use of shade trees in these
landscape areas is required.  All off-street parking areas containing more than
6,000 square feet of area, or 20 or more vehicular parking spaces, whichever is
less, shall provide areas of landscaping plantings of grass, shrubs or trees
according to the following minimum requirements: 
   (a)   An area equal to five percent (5%) of the total area devoted to
parking space and parking lanes shall be landscaped and permeable.  Parking
lots shall also have a perimeter buffer of a minimum of five feet with a
vertical six inch concrete curb on the parking lot side. The perimeter buffer
shall contain elements such as mounding, trees, ground cover and shrubs that
will achieve an effective, continuous screen of a height of at least three feet
at maturity.  Mounding shall not exceed a 3 to 1 slope.
   (b)   Two trees shall be installed for every 6,000 square feet of total
ground covered by pavement. To retain visibility, deciduous trees have a clear
trunk of at least five feet above the ground. The remaining area shall be
landscaped with hardwood mulch, shrubs, and/or ground cover, not to exceed two
feet in height. Trees shall be planted at least four feet from the edge of
pavement where vehicles overhang.
1160.03  LANDSCAPING FOR SERVICE STRUCTURES.
   Service structures shall be screened in all zoning districts.  Service
structures shall include but not be limited to: loading docks, propane tanks,
dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults and other equipment or
elements providing service to a building or a site. Structures may be grouped
together; however, screening height shall be based upon the tallest of the
structures. A continuous planting of evergreen, fence, wall or earthen mound
must enclose any service structure on all sides, unless such structure must be
frequently moved or accessed, in which case screening material shall be
established on three sides and shall be at least one foot taller than the
height of the enclosed structure, but shall not be required to exceed ten feet
in height in any case. If the fourth side is visible from the public right-of-
way, it shall be gated and screened. Plant material used to screen a service
structure shall be an evergreen species that retains its needles throughout the
year. Deciduous plant material cannot be used to fulfill this screening
requirement. The height of the evergreen plant material at installation must be
equal to, or greater than, two-thirds of the height of the service structure(s)
and meet the height and one hundred percent (100%) opacity requirement within
four years.  All plant material shall be nursery grown, installed, and
maintained in accordance with good horticultural practices. Plant material
shall meet current standards set by the American Association of Nurserymen and
shall be freshly dug, have outstanding form and be free of disease, insects
and/or damage. Alternatives to these materials that can be shown to meet both
the intent and requirements of this Zoning Code may be approved if adequate
evidence is presented that alternative means of screening will be equally
effective.
1160.04  VEGETATED BUFFERS AND SCREENING.
   (a)   Buffers and screening may be required help mitigate impacts associated
when different land use types are located next to each other and to eliminate
or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights,
signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas, or to provide spacing to
reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions. 
Physical buffers and visual screens between different, adjoining land uses are
critical design elements that should be utilized to reduce undesirable visual
impacts. In highly developed urban areas, visual screens should be a
combination of structural elements (walls and fences) and non-structural,
natural elements (berms and plantings).  Structural screens should appear as
extensions of a building's design repeating architectural features including
building materials, textures and colors.  Screening walls should not be
painted, but constructed from high quality, long-lasting materials (such as
brick, stone, and decorative block).  A combination of structural screens and
natural landscape plant materials should be provided between parking lots and
sidewalks or other pedestrian use areas.
   (b)   Screening shall be required when nonresidential buildings or
incompatible uses are proposed to be located next to land that is zoned with a
residential category.     
1160.05  PLANT MATERIALS.
   Whenever in this Zoning Code a planting is required, it shall be installed
within six (6) months from the date of issuance of a Zoning Certificate and
shall thereafter be reasonably maintained with permanent, live plant
materials.  The use of a variety of plant materials is encouraged to create
visual interest and the use of plant material native to the Sylvania area is
encouraged.   
1160.06  LANDSCAPING PLAN.
   Preparation and approval of a Landscaping Plan is required when a Site Plan
or Development Plan involves development or redevelopment of a single
structure, or groups of structures that exceed 5,000 square feet in gross floor
area collectively or individually.    The Sylvania Department of Parks and
Forestry shall also be consulted for recommended plant materials when Landscape
Plans are to be prepared.     
1160.07  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION OF LANDSCAPING  PLAN.
   Landscaping Plans required pursuant to Section
1160.06 shall be prepared by a Landscape Architect, registered in the State of
Ohio.

1161.01  EXCEPTION FOR ESTABLISHED FRONT YARDS.
   Where forty percent or more of the frontage on the same side of a street
between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have a front
yard greater or lesser in depth than otherwise required, new buildings shall be
erected no closer to the street than the average front yard so established by
the existing buildings, but may be erected using the average front yard so
established. In the B-2, M-1 and M-2 Districts, the front yard need not exceed
the specified front yard for the District. 
1161.02  FRONT YARDS.
   (a)   Corner Lots.  Where front yards have been established or may be
required on each of two intersecting streets, there shall be a front yard on
each street side of a corner lot, with the following two exceptions:
      (1)   In R Districts, where established front yards exceed twenty-five
feet, only one front yard in excess of twenty-five feet shall be required.
      (2)   The building width of a lot of record need not be reduced to less
than twenty-eight feet when the owner of such lot can show that ownership and
control of any adjacent lot or lots of record are by another person.
   (b)   Through Lots. In the case of through lots, unless the prevailing front
yard pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, front yards shall be
provided on all frontages. Where one of the front yards that would normally be
required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern,
the Zoning Administrator may waive the requirement for the normal front yard
and substitute therefore a special yard requirement which shall not exceed the
average of the yards provided on adjacent lots.
1161.03  BUILDING PROJECTIONS.
   The following rules shall apply to building projections into required yards:
   (a)   An enclosed balcony, fire escape, unenclosed and uncovered porch or
metal awning may project into a required front or rear yard for a distance not
exceeding ten feet, and into a required side yard not exceeding three feet.
   (b)   Sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves and ornamental features may

   (b)   Public, semipublic or public service buildings, hospitals,
institutions or schools, where permitted, may be erected to a height not
exceeding sixty feet and churches and temples may be erected to a height not
exceeding seventy-five feet when the required side and rear yards are each
increased by one foot for each foot of additional building height above the
height regulations for the district in which the building is located.
1161.05  SOLAR PANELS.
   Solar panels are allowed in any zoning district when located on a roof
surface and do not protrude more than 12 inches above the roof surface it is
attached to. Solar panels that are free-standing structures, supported on
racking systems or other structural elements permanently affixed to the ground
are considered to be a Special Uses pursuant to Chapter
1153.

1163.01  INTENT.
   (a)   Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance or
amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of
land and structures which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was passed
or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance or future amendments thereto.
   (b)   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. Such uses are declared by this Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved.
1163.02  ENLARGEMENT AND EXPANSION PROHIBITED.
   Nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be
used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the
same district. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land,
or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or
enlarged after passage of this Zoning Ordinance by attachment on a building or
premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, except
as provided in Section
1117.09(c), or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be
prohibited generally in the district involved. 
1163.03  BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner. 
1163.04  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under
the terms of this Ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   If any such nonconforming use of land is voluntarily discontinued for
two years or more, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such
land is located.
   (d)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
1163.05  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of
this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards
or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (a)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity.
   (b)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than fifty percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not
be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (c)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
1163.06  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
   If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance
that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance,
the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, finds that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals may require appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance. 
1163.07  CHANGE TO CONFORMING USE.
   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
1163.08  DISCONTINUANCE OF USE.
   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is voluntarily discontinued for two years or more, the structure
or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
1163.09  REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS.
   Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing a
nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary nonstructural repairs which
do not tend to prolong the life of supporting members of a building or
structure such as bearing walls, columns, beams or girders. Incidental
alterations are permitted which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming
use.

   (a)    Computation of Sign Area.  The aggregate surface area of a sign or of
all the signs on a property shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)    The area of a sign (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or

square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass
the extreme limits of the copy, representation, emblem, and/or other display;
      (2)    The area of a sign, or any portion thereof, shall exclude any
decorative embellishments and any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when such structures do not have letters, parts of letters,
words, figures, numerals, emblems, devices, designs, trademarks, posters,
handbills or other objects affixed thereon and is clearly incidental to the
display itself.  Freestanding sign structures may extend above the allowable
height and/or permitted horizontal dimension for the purposes of sign structure
enhancement or embellishment, provided such extension does not exceed a maximum
of twelve (12) inches on any side;
      (3)    The area of a sign, or any portion thereof, having a distinctive
or ornamental background which sets the background apart from a larger surface
so that it forms an integral part or element of the sign, including any frame
that forms an integral part of the display or is used to differentiate the sign
from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, shall include the
area of the background;
      (4)    If any portion of the words, symbols or pictorial elements of a
sign extends beyond a border or background, the area of that portion of the
sign shall be the area of a rectangle inscribed around it;
      (5)    The area of any sign hung, placed, painted or displayed on a
marquee or awning shall be included in determining the total area of signs
erected or displayed;
      (6)    The total area of a double-face sign shall be considered to be the
area of the largest face;
      (7)    The total area of a sign having more than two faces shall be the
sum of the area of all the faces of the sign, less the area of the smallest
face;
      (8)    The total area of spherical, free-form, sculptural, or other non-
planar signs shall be seventy-five (75) percent of the sum of the areas using
only the four vertical sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign;
      (9)    The total area of all signs shall not include temporary window
signs.
   (b)    Computation of Freestanding Sign Height.  The height of a
freestanding sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign
at a normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. In
cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height
shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at
the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the
crown of a public street, or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to
the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.

1175.01  CONFERENCE.
   It is suggested that before any extensive work is done on any subdivision
the owner or his representative discuss his plans with the Planning Commission,
which will give assistance concerning requirements and further procedures, the
purpose being to determine whether the proposed subdivision will fit into the
neighborhood development of the area and conform, in effect, to the Master
Plan. The steps in this chapter may be taken to secure approval of a plat.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1175.02  SKETCH DRAWING.
   A sketch drawing may be submitted in duplicate to the Planning Commission
through the Service Director for its review and recommendations. The drawing
shall contain enough information so that an accurate analysis can be made. The
Commission, with the assistance of the Service Director, shall advise and aid
the developer or owner in obtaining the best possible layout for all concerned.
After a proper solution has been worked out, the developer or owner may proceed
with his preliminary drawing.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1175.03  PRELIMINARY DRAWING.
   A preliminary drawing hereinafter referred to in this chapter as "drawing"
containing all the information as required by these regulations, may be
submitted to the Planning Commission for processing. The drawing shall be
prepared by a registered surveyor or civil engineer.
   (a)    The drawing shall be analyzed by the Planning Commission for
conformance with these regulations. If the drawing does not conform with these
regulations, the developer and surveyor or engineer shall be notified so that
the drawing may be revised.
   (b)    If the drawing is acceptable, it shall be sent to the appropriate
public agencies for their review and recommendations.
   (c)    When the recommendations of the public agencies are received they are
reviewed, and if the drawing is not acceptable to any public agency, the
developer and surveyor or engineer are notified so that the drawing may be
revised. If the drawing is acceptable and/or subject to certain modifications,
the drawing is presented to the Planning Commission for consideration.
   (d)    If the subdivision lot areas or uses do not conform with the existing
zoning classification, a petition to rezone such area shall be submitted by the
property owner and acted upon by the Planning Commission prior to consideration
of a drawing.
   (e)    The Planning Commission may introduce such changes or revisions to
the drawing as are deemed necessary to the interests and needs of the community
provided such changes are not in violation of the rules and regulations
contained herein. Any changes agreed to by the subdivider or his representative
shall be marked in red on the approved drawing. The surveyor or engineer shall
then furnish the Planning Commission with seven copies of the revised drawing
containing such agreements.
   (f)    Approval of the drawing is valid for one year and allows the
developer to proceed with the preparation of the improvements plans required by
the various public agencies. It also allows the developer to proceed with
construction of the improvements as soon as the required plans are reviewed and
approved by the appropriate public agencies.
   (g)    The Planning Commission shall disapprove the drawing if it does not
contain the necessary information, is not in accordance with the provisions of
these regulations or if the proposed improvements are not approved by the
appropriate public agencies.
   (h)    The subdivider and surveyor or engineer shall be notified in writing
of the Planning Commission action, and the notification of its action shall
also be given to the appropriate public agencies.

be filed as provided for in Chapter
1177.
   (j)    Fifteen copies of the drawing shall be submitted at least twenty days

1179.01  GENERAL.
   All plats and subdivisions within the corporate limits and within three
miles of such corporate limits, subject to the provisions of Ohio R.C. 711.09
shall conform to the rules and regulations contained in this chapter.
   (a)   Development shall conform in effect to the Master Plan as adopted.
   (b)   The proposed subdivision and its ultimate use shall be in the best
interests of the public welfare and the neighborhood development of the area.
   (c)   The tract to be subdivided should not encroach upon an area or areas
designated in the comprehensive plan for future public facilities.  Such area
or areas shall be incorporated in the drawing and reserved for a period of one
year after approval thereof, or for a longer period as may be mutually agreed,
to allow the Municipality, or other appropriate agencies, time to acquire such
land.
   (d)   Variations, exceptions and/or modifications of these rules and
regulations may be made by the Planning Commission in specific cases where it
is deemed that unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require
such modification or adjustment of these subdivision requirements, provided
that such plats are self- contained and do not encroach unfavorably on or
interfere with the most normal development of abutting properties.
      (Ord. 25-70.  Passed 5-4-70.)
1179.02  INTENSITY OF LAND USE.
   The minimum size of lots shall be as follows:
   (a)    The minimum of one net acre per lot shall be provided when either or
both wells and septic tanks are to be used except as hereinafter provided.
   (b)    A minimum of 7,200 square feet per lot shall be provided for single-
family residences when both public water and sanitary sewage systems are
available unless larger lots are required by zoning.
   (c)    Greater densities for other than single-family dwellings conforming
to the zoning requirements shall be permitted in areas where both public water
and sanitary sewage systems are provided.
      (Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1179.03  STREETS.
   (a)    Streets shall be planned for convenient circulation toward the
principal directions of travel, bus routes, schools and playgrounds. The
pattern shall be continuous, and yet indirect enough to discourage an excess
amount of through traffic. On the interior design, T-type intersections shall
be predominant, while cross-intersections shall be avoided except at major
streets. The street patterns shall include some extensions to the boundaries of
the development to provide circulation between adjoining neighborhoods.
   (b)    Right-of-way widths shall conform to the following minimums:
 
Classification            Right-of-Way Width (feet)
Limited access expressway 200

Major arterial street     100
Collector street          80
Minor street              60
   The aforesaid classifications and widths shall conform to the designation as
such contained in the comprehensive plan.
   (c)    Streets shall intersect each other as nearly at right angles as
possible.
   (d)    New streets shall be a continuation of existing streets or provide a
minimum jog of one hundred twenty feet from the existing street alignment.

the terminal shall be a circular area with a minimum diameter of one hundred
feet.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1179.04  BLOCKS.
   (a)    Blocks shall be designated to accommodate lots of a size required for
the district and to provide convenient circulation, service and safety on the
boundary streets. The block shall be designed so that rear lot lines shall
coincide with drainage courses, railroads and divisions in land uses.
   (b)    The maximum length of blocks shall generally be one-quarter mile or
1,320 feet. The Planning Commission may require a crosswalkway in blocks that
exceed nine hundred feet.
   (c)    The width of blocks shall be sufficient to accommodate two tiers of
lots, except a single tier of lots, which lots shall have a greater depth than
the minimum requirement of one hundred twenty feet may be required to separate
residential development from major streets, adjoining nonresidential uses,
unusual topographic or natural features. An easement for screen planting of at
least ten feet which shall not be traversed by vehicles may be required along
the lots abutting such a major street or nonresidential land use.
   (d)    Blocks for multi-family, commercial or industrial subdivisions shall
be adequate to accommodate the building sites and provide the yards, service
drives, off-street parking and other required facilities.

building line or conform to zoning requirements, whichever is greater.
   (c)    All lots shall abut on a public street or place.
   (d)    Corner residential lots shall have extra width sufficient for
maintenance of building lines on both streets. The minimum width shall be
seventy feet.
   (e)    Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial
to the street
line.  (Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1179.06  PUBLIC SPACES.
   Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of outstanding natural and
cultural features such as scenic spots, watercourses and historic sites.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1179.07  BUILDING LINES.
   All lots, including commercial, industrial and residential, shall have a
minimum setback or building line of twenty-five feet from the right of way,
except where the zoning requires a greater amount. In such case the greater of
the two shall be required.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1179.08  EASEMENTS.
   (a)    Utility easements five feet in width shall be provided along the rear
of each lot and/or five feet in width along side lot lines where necessary.

1179.09  COMMERCIAL AREAS.
   (a)    A commercial subdivision may show lots which need not conform to any
minimum width or area, but it shall show the location within which buildings
may be erected and the area that is to be reserved for off-street parking and
service areas.
   (b)    The location for vehicular movements between the area and adjacent
streets shall be indicated, and restrictions shall be recorded upon the plat
which shall restrict such vehicular movements to the location shown on the
plat.
   (c)    Easements may be required providing for vehicular movements through
parking areas and to and from service areas, as well as easements which can be
improved as buffer areas wherever the area adjoins property zoned for
residential use. The installation of planting, walls, fences or other
improvements that will assure a satisfactory buffer or protective screen within

1181.01 SUBDIVIDER RESPONSIBLE FOR MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
   Within the corporate limits and for the unincorporated territory within
three miles of such corporate limits subject to the limitation thereon provided
in Ohio R.C. 711.09, all plats and subdivisions of land within such City or
territory shall conform to the rules and regulations contained herein as
adopted by Council and/or the Planning Commission, and the subdivider shall
provide, construct, install and pay for the minimum improvements required by
the City and specified herein.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1181.02  GRADING.
   (a)    All lots shall be graded so that all storm water will drain
therefrom. Such grading shall not cause ponding on properties adjacent to the
plat, add areas of storm water runoff nor provide points of extreme
concentration on them not existing prior to the proposed development.
   (b)    The basement or other floor elevation shall be at a minimum elevation
of one foot above the estimated high water level of any area affected or likely
to be affected by the flooding of public watercourses. Such elevations shall be
a matter of public record and recited on the final plat. Compliance with this
section shall be a condition of obtaining building and occupancy permits.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
   (c)    Elevations shall be indicated on the plat at lot corners and
elsewhere to assure that storm water drains away from the house and lot to a
storm sewer and ditch pertaining to the subdivision. The plat should also
contain the following recitation: The minimum ground elevation at the top of
foundation shall be no less than ten inches higher than the average of
elevations shown at the street right-of-way line. The location and elevation of
a permanent bench mark shall be indicated on the plat. The Planning Commission
may, upon receipt of a petition from affected property owners, grant a variance
of the elevations of the lot corners and/or lower the minimum ground elevation
at the top of the foundation so long as the foregoing drainage regulations are
not violated in principle. The owners of lots so petitioning shall record such
approved changes and file copies of the instrument with the secretary of the
Planning Commission and the Director of Public Service of the City.
(Ord. 2-71. Passed 1-4-71.)
1181.03  STREETS.
   (a)    All streets within a subdivision shall be improved with a hard
surface pavement with adequate drainage at a minimum width of twenty-four feet,
and there shall be a curb along each side of such surfacing.
   (b)    Additional pavement lanes and/or traffic signalization may be
required for commercial or other special developments to provide acceleration,
deceleration or left turn lanes, or handle or control excessive traffic that
may be generated by such developments. Complete data with respect to character
and volume of expected traffic generated by the development may be required.
   (c)    A greater width of pavement not to exceed forty feet may be required
in industrial or special apartment developments.
   (d)    Minimum pavement gutter elevations shall be at or above hydraulic
grade line for a ten year frequency storm.
   (e)    Streets abutting the subdivisions that are not presently paved or
curbed nor have a design grade on them will normally not be required to be
paved at the time the subdivisions are to be constructed. However, all lots in
the plat abutting such streets shall have included in their deeds or portions
thereof, a waiver of objection for the assessment for paving, curbing and
draining. This waiver of objection is to be recited on the plat, and is to be
an instrument of record affecting future title of properties.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1181.04  WATER.
   (a)    When an adequate public water line is within 1,000 feet of the
subdivision, such line shall be extended so that each lot is accessible to the
public water supply.
   (b)    When a public water supply system is used and lots are less than one
acre, sanitary sewers shall be provided and connected to a public system or an
approved treatment plant, except as provided in Section
1181.05(d)(1) and (2).
   (c)    Where an adequate public water line is not available, a well may be
the source of water supply for each lot if such well and water quality meet the
health standards of the appropriate Board of Health and the lots are one acre
or more in size.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70. )
1181.05  SANITARY WASTE DISPOSAL.
   (a)    Public System.  When the proposed subdivision is located within five
hundred feet of an adequate sanitary sewer line, a connection to the line shall
be provided for each lot
by the developer.
   (b)    Independent System.
      (1)    When lots are less than one acre and a sanitary sewer is not
available, except as provided in subsection (d)(2) hereof, an adequate sanitary
treatment plant and the necessary sanitary sewer lines accessible to each lot
shall be provided by the developer. The system, where practicable, is to be
designed so it can be integrated into the master plan of sanitary sewers when
the public sewers are installed.
      (2)    Where a number of subdivisions are proposed to be on adjacent
tracts and/or sufficient buildable property is in close proximity to each
other, the legislative authority may cause to have constructed a sanitary
treatment plant and the necessary lines, except laterals, to serve the plats,
and assess the costs to the benefitted owners.
   (c)    Sanitary Manhole.  The minimum elevation at the top of any sanitary
manhole casting shall be not less than one foot higher than the estimated
twenty-five year high water level.
   (d)    Septic Tanks.
      (1)    Septic tanks may be used for lots of one acre or more in area if
soil percolation tests, as prescribed by the appropriate Board of Health, have
indicated a reasonably useful life for such disposal methods. Other methods of
disposal may be approved by the appropriate Board of Health.
      (2)    Subject to approval of the appropriate Board of Health, septic
tanks may be used on lots with less than one acre when the plat is in an area
that can expect trunk sewers to be extended to it within a two year period as
determined by the Director of Public Service, but sanitary lateral sewers
serving each lot, properly installed and blocked off shall be provided. (Ord.
25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1181.06  STORM SEWERS.
   (a)   Storm sewers shall be designed to flow just full for the five year
intensity-duration- frequency storm using the Rational Method.  The minimum
pavement gutter elevations shall be at or above the hydraulic grade line for a
ten year frequency storm.
   For the ten year hydraulic gradient checks, minimum starting point
elevation, when a proposed storm drainage system outlets into a nearby stream
or ditch, shall be based on the twenty-five year high water elevation.  If
information is unavailable, the high water elevation shall be determined by
following sound engineering principles subject to approval by the Director of
Public Service.
   (b)   All structures within a new street right of way shall be designed to
adequately handle the storm drainage of the proposed improvement as determined
by the Director of Public Service.
   (c)   All site development involving one acre or more of property, shall be
required to include on-site storm water detention/retention per the City’s
current Storm Water Management Plan (“SWMP”).  The minimum detention volume for
the site shall be equivalent to the storage volume produced from a twenty-five
year frequency (post-developed) storm inflow with an allowable discharge of a
five year frequency (pre-developed) storm outflow.  The storm water detention
calculations for the site shall be submitted with the site grading plans and
shall be subject to approval by the Director of Public Service.
   (d)   All storm water collection systems shall be designed to include, but
not limited to, storm water treatment for the removal of sediment.  The type of
storm water treatment shall be in accordance to the applicable best management
practice(s) (BMPs) as listed in the City’s current SWMP.  All construction and
maintenance  of storm water collection system shall be in accordance to the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s Permit No. OHC000002, or more current
permit update.  All construction details, involving storm water treatment and
maintenance, shall be shown on the Erosion Control Plan for the site, which
shall be submitted with the site grading plans subject to review and approval
from the Director of Public Service.  All developers or property owners shall
maintain any post-construction structural BMPs according to the maintenance
requirements of said BMP.  All post-construction structural BMPs will be
inventoried and subject to inspection by the Department of Public Service. 
Failure to properly maintain the BMP will result in penalties according to
subsection (f) hereof.
   (e)   Notification of Violation; Time Limit.  Any person found to be
violating any provisions of subsection (d) hereof shall be served by the City
with a written notice, stating the nature of the violation, sent by first class
mail to the person apparently guilty of the violation.  This notice shall be
deemed sufficient, in the event of violation, if sent to the address of that
person as shown on the Lucas County tax records or water account records.  The
notice shall, in all cases, set forth a time limit during which all noted
violations shall cease and be abated, and appropriate corrective action taken,
and if the violator shall not thus comply, the provisions of subsection (f)
hereof shall then apply.
   (f)   Violation Beyond Time Limit; Penalty.  Any person who continues any
violation beyond the time limit provided for in subsection (d) hereof is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the second degree and shall be punished as provided in
Section
501.99  of the General Offenses Code.
   (g)   (1)   Drainage ditches shall be enclosed to accommodate the estimated
ten year storm when the enclosure is equivalent in capacity to forty-eight
inches in diameter or less.  Such enclosures shall be constructed, installed
and paid for by the developer.  All other drainage ditches in or abutting the
development shall be realigned, widened and/or deepened to accommodate the
estimated storm water run-off.  All structures shall be enclosed within new
street right of way.  Such enclosures shall be adequate to handle the storm
drainage and shall be constructed, installed and paid for by the developer. 
Where flood plains are being reduced or eliminated by the site grading of the
proposed development, approval shall be obtained from the applicable agency as
to the watercourse’s adequacy to handle the additional water due to the altered
land use condition.
      (2)   Storm hydraulic grade lines shall be based on estimated run-off
conditions in watershed ten years from the time the improvement is made.  (Ord.
6- 2008.  Passed 2-20-08.)
1181.07  SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks not less than four feet wide shall be provided on both sides of
the new streets within the subdivision and on the abutting side of any existing
street contiguous to the subdivision. Installation may be deferred for a period
of three years by posting bond, as provided in Section
1181.09, to permit the building of dwellings prior to the installation of
sidewalks provided that no such deferment shall be continued in effect or
granted as to a particular block in a subdivision after seventy percent or more
of the lots in such blocks have dwellings constructed thereon. Sidewalks shall
be installed or provisions made to defer installation before occupancy permits
are issued.  (Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1181.08  MONUMENTS.
   A monument shall be placed at each change in direction on the boundary of
the plat, and one such monument shall be placed on the centerline of right of
way of each street intersection, and at the beginning and end of all street
curves. A monument as defined in Section
1173.01(19)(a) shall be placed in all unpaved areas. A monument as defined in
Section
1173.01(19)(b) shall be placed in all paved areas.
(Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)
1181.09  BOND IN LIEU OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   In lieu of the installation of the above improvements prior to the approval
and recording of the plat, the subdivider may file a surety bond or escrow
agreement. In the event the surety bond or escrow agreement is furnished, the
requirements set forth in Section
1181.10 shall be complied with as a condition precedent to the release of the
bond or escrow agreement so furnished. (Ord. 25-70. Passed 5-4-70.)

1187.03   Repair and maintenance exception.
1187.04   Boundaries.
1187.05   Specific requirements in the Neighborhood Character Architectural
District.
1187.06   Interpretation of requirements in the Neighborhood Character
Architectural District.
1187.07   Specific requirements in the Downtown Architectural District and
Gateway Architectural District.
1187.08   General standards for review; certificate of appropriateness in the
Downtown Architectural District and Gateway Architectural District.

1187.10   Certificate of appropriateness required for demolition.
1187.11   Board of Architectural Review.
1187.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Architectural Districts are to maintain a high character
of community development, to protect and preserve property, to promote the
stability of property values and to  protect the general community welfare by
regulating the exterior architectural characteristics of structures in areas
hereinafter defined.  Standards and guidelines described herein help ensure
that new development and redevelopment is compatible with existing urban form
and local plans for enhancement of unique urban areas in the City.  The
Architectural Districts also help advance the planning goals expressed in the
Sylvania Land Use Plan, Downtown Plan, Gateway District Plan, and related
planning documents.
(Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.02  THREE ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICTS AS OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   There are three Architectural Districts that apply to specific areas in the
City.  The Neighborhood Character Architectural District is created to help
maintain the distinctive appeal of older residential neighborhoods in and near
downtown Sylvania.  These residential areas are locally-significant with
historic roots associated with the earliest days of the City of Sylvania.  The
Downtown Architectural District recognizes the unique character of downtown
Sylvania and contains requirements to help ensure that new construction on
infill lots, along with the renovation of existing buildings, will blend with
the urban fabric and character of Downtown Sylvania.  The Gateway Architectural
District is established to draw attention to the importance of areas adjacent
to the US 23 interchange.  This general area serves to welcome visitors to the
City of Sylvania and therefore it is essential to maintain a quality
introductory environment that expresses a positive community image.  The Three
Architectural Districts are overlay zoning districts.  They include development
standards and requirements that are in addition to those established by
underlying zoning districts.  All standards and regulations of the underlying
zoning district apply, except where specifically modified or supplemented by
provisions of these Architectural Districts.
(Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.03  REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE EXCEPTION.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent any ordinary repair or
maintenance of an exterior architectural feature or any ordinary planting and
landscaping.
(Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.04  BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the Three Architectural Districts are illustrated on the
Official Zoning Map of the City of Sylvania.
(Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.05  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER ARCHITECTURAL
DISTRICT.
   In addition to requirements established within the underlying zoning
district, the following additional requirements shall be met:
   (a)   Building Orientation: All construction and/or renovation of a
principal structure must provide for a single principal entrance, and that
principal entrance shall face a public street.
   (b)   Building Height: No new construction and/or renovation of a principal
structure shall be constructed which is more than thirty percent (30%) above or
below the average height of residences on the same block of land and on the
same side of the street.
   (c)   Front Yard Average: All construction and/or renovation of a principal
structure shall meet the required setbacks of the zoning district in which it
is located.  Further, no principal building, or addition thereto, may be
located further away from the street right of way line than the average setback
of all structures along the block.
   (d)   Building Materials: No less than 75 percent of the exterior building
materials used for the construction and/or renovation of a principal structure
shall be materials also found on the exterior of structures along the same
block, and same side of the street.
   (e)   Lot Coverage: The proposed ratio of area occupied by principal and
accessory buildings and lot area, may not exceed the average ratio of area
occupied by principal and accessory buildings and lot area for all adjacent
buildings by more than 1.25 times.
   (f)   Rooflines and Shapes: Roof shapes and rooflines must be generally
compatible with other buildings and structures found along the same block. 
Where there is a dominant pattern of roof planes along a street, (such as roof
planes generally parallel to the right-of-way line, perpendicular to the right-
of-way line, or a certain combination of both) such pattern shall be similarly
expressed in new construction and/or renovation.  Similarly, roof pitches shall
be similar to structures found along the same block.
   (g)   Lot Combinations: To help preserve and protect the historic character
of the neighborhood and the rhythm of building mass, lot combinations are
discouraged.  Whenever applications are made to construct a new principal
structure or add to an existing principal structure, on two or more separate or
combined parcels, such an application shall be first reviewed by the Design
Review Board.  This review shall include consideration of proposed building
mass and scale in the context of neighboring property.  Plan approval may
including conditions requiring measures to reduce the visual mass of the
building to make it compatible with established residences.
   (h)   Garages: Attached garages may not occupy more than thirty percent
(30%) of the total linear front facade distance facing the street. Detached
garages also may not occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of the total linear
facade distance facing the street, unless located wholly behind the main
building.
      (Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.06  INTERPRETATION OF REQUIREMENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER
ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT.
   Any questions of interpretation of the requirements associated with the
Neighborhood Character Architectural District listed above shall be refereed to
the Board of Architectural Review for a determination.
(Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.07  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IN THE DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT AND
GATEWAY ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT.
   (a)   Whenever a structure within the Downtown Architectural District or
Gateway Architectural Districts is proposed to be constructed or erected, or
whenever an existing structure within the Downtown Architectural District or
Gateway Architectural District is proposed to be altered, reconstructed,
enlarged or remodeled, such that it involves the exterior design, material,
finish grade line, major landscaping or orientation of the structure, an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall first be obtained. The
application shall be accompanied by a line drawing indicating lot dimensions,
size, shape, and dimensions of the structure, the location and orientation of
the structure on the lot and the actual or proposed building setback lines.  In
addition, the application shall be accompanied by photos, illustrations and
narrative material that describing the proposed design or change of design, use
of materials, finish grade line, landscaping and orientation of the structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness,
which is accompanied by supporting material the application shall be referred
to the Board of Architectural Review at its next regular meeting not more than
forty-five (45) days from the date the application is filed.  The Chairperson
of the Board may also call a special meeting to consider such application.  The
Board shall consider and grant or deny the Certificate of Appropriateness
within forty-five (45) days from the date of the filing of the application. 
The applicant may agree to extend this time period. 
(Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.08  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR REVIEW; CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS IN THE
DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT AND GATEWAY ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT.
   The Board of Architectural Review, in deciding whether to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness, shall determine that the application under
consideration promotes, preservesand enhances the architectural character of
the community and would be consistent with the City of Sylvania’s Architectural
Review Guidelines.  In conducting its review, the Board shall make examination
of and give consideration to the elements of the application including, but not
necessarily limited to:
   (a)   Height.
   (b)   Building massing, which shall include the relationship of the building
width to its height and depth, and its relationship to the viewer’s and
pedestrian’s visual perspective.
   (c)   Window treatment, which shall include the size, shape and materials of
the individual window units and the overall harmonious relationship of window
openings.
   (d)   Exterior detail and relationships, which shall include all projecting
and receding elements of the exterior, including but not limited to, porches
and overhangs and the horizontal or vertical expression which is conveyed by
these elements.
   (e)   Roof shape, which shall include type, form and materials.
   (f)   Materials, texture and color, which shall include a consideration of
material compatibility among various elements of the structure.
   (g)   Compatibility of design and detail, which shall include the
appropriateness of the use of exterior design details.

which enhance pedestrian movement and environment and which relate to the
pedestrian’s visual perspective.
   (j)   Signage, which shall include the appropriateness of signage to the
building.
      (Ord. 56-2015.  Passed 4-18-16.)
1187.09  HISTORIC STANDARDS FOR REVIEW; CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS IN THE
DOWNTOWN ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT AND GATEWAY ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT.
   When a historic property is involved (50 or more years old or older), the
Board of Architectural Review shall consider the general standards listed
above, along with the ten federal standards established by the Secretary of the
U.S. Department of the Interior as follows as evaluative criteria.  These are
as follows:
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed.  The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time.  Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment.  These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible.  In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities.  Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, should be substantiated by historic, physical or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other buildings or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible.  Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be
unimpaired.
   (k)   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the U.S. Secretary of
