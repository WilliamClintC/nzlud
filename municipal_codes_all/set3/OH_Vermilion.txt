ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 87-13
PASSED  May 4, 1987

VERMILION, OHIO, 1987; REPEALING ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS IN CONFLICT
THEREWITH; PUBLISHING THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Vermilion, Ohio, has had the matter of
recodification and general revision of the legislation of the City before it
for some time; and
   WHEREAS, the Council has heretofore entered into a contract with The
Justinian Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Vermilion,
Counties of Erie and Lorain, State of Ohio:
   Section 1:  That the ordinances and resolutions of the City of Vermilion,

consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Vermilion, Ohio,
1987.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct

hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of
Vermilion, Ohio.
   Section 2:  That ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior
to February 16, 1987, which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified
Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance,
except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

without an ordinance or resolution history or with the words "Adopting
Ordinance" at the end thereof are or contain new matter ordained by this
Adopting Ordinance.
 
   Section 5:  That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency
measure necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health,
safety and welfare of the City of Vermilion and the inhabitants thereof for the
reason that it is necessary to have an up-to-date codification of the laws of
the City, one which is consistent with the latest State law, where such
consistency is required by the Ohio Constitution, with which to administer the
affairs of the City and ensure law and order; and provided it receives the
majority vote of two-thirds or more of those elected or appointed to City
Council, it shall go into full force immediately after its passage and its
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect at the earliest period
allowed by law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections.  Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Vermilion was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Vermilion Codified Ordinances is indicated.

CHARTER
OF THE
CITY OF VERMILION
PREAMBLE
We, the people of the City of Vermilion in the Counties of Erie and Lorain and
State of Ohio, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits of municipal home
rule and exercise all the powers of local self-government under the
Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, do adopt this Charter for our
Municipality.
         
ARTICLE I
THE MUNICIPALITY
SECTION I-1. Name.
   The municipal corporation now existing in the Counties of Erie and Lorain
and State of Ohio and known as the City of Vermilion, Ohio, shall continue to
be a body politic and corporate under the name of the City of Vermilion or
Village of Vermilion according to the classification of municipalities under
the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio then in effect. The provisions
of this Charter shall apply whether this Municipality is a village or a city.
         
ARTICLE II
POWERS OF THE MUNICIPALITY
                             
SECTION II-1. Powers.
   The Municipality shall have all the powers, general or special, governmental
or proprietary, that may now or hereafter lawfully be possessed or exercised by
municipal corporations under the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio.
         
SECTION II-2. Manner of Exercise.
   The powers of this Municipality shall be exercised in the manner prescribed
in this Charter, or to the extent not prescribed herein, then in such manner as
the Council may determine, and when not prescribed in this Charter or
determined by Council, such powers shall be exercised in such manner as may now
or hereafter be provided by the general laws of the State of Ohio.
         
ARTICLE III
COUNCIL
SECTION III-1. Number and Term.
   The legislative powers of the Municipality, except as otherwise provided by
this Charter and the Constitution of the State of Ohio, shall be vested in a
Council of seven members elected for terms of two years commencing on the first
day of January next following their election.
   For the terms of Councilmen beginning January 1976 and thereafter the
Council shall consist of seven persons, five of whom shall be elected by
electors of the wards of the City of Vermilion and two of whom shall be elected
by the electors of the City at large, and any vacancy shall be filled as
provided in
Section 6 of this Article.
   The Council shall after each recurring Federal census, and within six months
after the issuance of the proclamation by the Secretary of the State of Ohio of
the population of the City, subdivide the City into five wards. The wards shall
be composed of adjacent and compact territory as nearly equal in population as
practicable. If the Council fails to make the subdivision within the time
required, the subdivision shall be made by the Mayor.
(Amended 11-6-73.)
   
SECTION III-2. Qualifications.
   All members of Council shall have been residents of the Municipality for at
least two continuous years prior to their election and all members of Council
elected by the electors of the wards of the City of Vermilion shall also have
been residents of the ward from which they are elected for a period of one
continuous year prior to their election. All Council members elected at large
shall continue to be residents of the Municipality at large and all members
elected by electors of the wards shall continue to be residents of the wards
from which they were elected. A member of Council shall not hold any other
public office, except as otherwise provided in this Charter or by ordinance
enacted thereunder, and that of Notary Public or membership in the State
Militia or reserve corps of the United States.
   Any member of Council who shall cease to possess, or who violates any of the
qualifications herein enumerated shall forfeit his office, but failure to
maintain said qualifications shall not render void or ineffective any action of
Council in which such member has participated.
   The period of residence in the Municipality required under this or any other
section of this Charter shall include the period of residence in any territory
which has been annexed to the Municipality. (Amended 11-2-76.)
SECTION III-3. Organization.
   At 8 p.m. on the second day of January, 1962, and on the second day of
January of each even-numbered year thereafter (or if such date be a Saturday or
Sunday, then the following Monday), the Council shall meet in the Council
Chamber for the purpose of organization. The Council shall adopt its own rules,
regulations and/or by-laws except as otherwise provided in this Charter.
SECTION III-4. President of Council and President Pro Tem.
   The President of Council shall be elected at a general election by the
electorate of the City and the other Council at Large position so elected by
the electorate shall automatically become the President Pro-tem of Council, who
shall preside at meetings of Council in the absence of the President of
Council.  The President of Council elected at the November 2013 election shall
serve a term of two (2) years.  When the Mayor is absent or inaccessible or for
any reason is unable to perform his duties as Mayor, then the President of
Council shall become the acting Mayor, and while so acting shall have and
exercise all of the powers of the Mayor, but he shall not thereby  cease to be
a member of Council.  In the event the President of Council is absent or
inaccessible or for any reason is unable to perform his duties as acting Mayor,
the President pro tem of Council shall become the acting Mayor, and while so
acting shall have all the powers and duties of the Mayor, but he shall not
thereby cease to be a member of Council. In case of a vacancy of the office of
Mayor, which vacancy occurs more than 180 days prior to the next regular
Municipal election at which the Mayor is to be elected, a special election will
be held at the earliest period allowed by law to elect a Mayor to fill the
unexpired term of the person who vacated the office of Mayor.  Until such
special election is held, or if the office of Mayor becomes vacant 180 days or
less immediately prior to the next regular Municipal election at which the
Mayor is to be elected, the President of Council shall become the acting Mayor,
and while so acting shall have and exercise all of the powers of the Mayor, but
he shall not thereby cease to be a member of Council.  If the office of
President of Council becomes vacant, any vacancies in Council shall first be
filled in the manner provided in Section 6 of this Article, and then a new
President of Council shall be chosen by Council.
   The President of Council shall have all the powers, duties, functions,
obligations and rights of any other member of Council, including the right to
vote; shall preside at all meetings of Council; and shall appoint the various
committees of Council, coordinating the work of the various committees
appointed by him.  (Amended 11-6-12.)
SECTION III-5. Removal.
   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own
members. It may remove any member for gross misconduct, or malfeasance in or
disqualification for office, or for conviction of a crime involving moral
turpitude, or if declared legally incompetent, or for violation of this
Charter, or persistent failure to abide by the rules of the Council; provided,
that such removal shall not take place without the affirmative vote of two-
thirds of the remaining members of Council nor until the accused member shall
have been notified of the charge against him and given an opportunity to be
heard. The accused member shall not vote on the question of his removal.
SECTION III-6. Vacancies.
   Any vacancy in the Council shall be filled by a majority vote of the
remaining members of Council for the unexpired term. If the vacancy is not
filled within thirty days after it shall have occurred, the Mayor shall fill it
by appointment. Any person elected by Council or appointed by the Mayor to fill
a vacancy on Council must meet all the residence requirements contained in this
Charter which are applicable to the Council seat to which he is elected or
appointed.
(Amended 11-2-76.)
SECTION III-7. Council Meetings.
   The Council shall hold at least one regular meeting in each calendar month.
A majority of the members of the Council shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at any meeting of the Council, but a lesser number may
adjourn the meeting from time to time and compel the attendance of absent
members in such manner and under such penalties as may be prescribed by
ordinance. At any meeting at which a quorum is present, any ordinance or
resolution may be passed or adopted, or any other action may be taken, by the
affirmative vote of four members of the Council unless a larger number be
required by the provisions of this Charter. The Clerk of Council shall keep a
record of its proceedings in a journal in which the yea or nay vote of each
Councilman voting on an ordinance, resolution or other measure may be recorded.
All meetings of the Council shall be open to the public and its journal shall
be available for public inspection at all reasonable times, except that the
President of Council or the Mayor, upon oral request, or any four
Councilpersons who shall deliver a request in writing to the Council Clerk, may
cause Council to meet in a closed executive session according to the procedures
and limited to the subject matter contained in the general statutes of the

Director of Finance shall find the petition sufficient, he shall promptly so
certify to Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer
whose removal is sought, and shall make a record of such delivery. If such
officer shall not resign within five days after the day on which such delivery
shall have been made, Council shall thereupon fix a day for holding a recall
election, not less than thirty days nor more than forty-five days after the
date of such delivery, and shall cause notice of such recall election to be
published on the same day of each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper
determined by Council to be of general circulation in the Municipality. At such
recall election, this question shall be placed upon the ballot: "Shall (naming
the officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?", with the
provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively, and in the
event a majority of the vote is negative such officer shall be considered as
removed, his office shall be deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as
provided in this Charter. The officer removed at such recall election shall not
be eligible for appointment to the vacancy created thereby. If the officer is
not removed at such recall election, no further recall petition shall be filed
against him for a period of one year following such election.
ARTICLE X
FINANCES AND TAXATION
                             
SECTION X-1. General.
   The laws of the State of Ohio relating generally to budgets, appropriations,
deposits, expenditures, debts, bonds, and other fiscal matters of the
Municipality shall be applicable to the Municipality, except as modified by or
necessarily inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter and except when
provision therefor is made in the Constitution of the State of Ohio.
SECTION X-2. Limitation on Tax Rate.
   The Council shall levy annually outside of the eight and three-quarters mill
limitation hereinafter provided, but subject to the ten mill limitation imposed
by the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, such tax as may be necessary
to pay the interest on and the principal of all notes and bonds heretofore or
hereafter issued in anticipation of the levy and collection of special
assessments which the Municipality is obligated to pay.
   Except as hereinabove provided, the aggregate amount of taxes that may be
levied by the Council without a vote of the people on property assessed and
listed for taxation according to value for all purposes of the Municipality,
shall not exceed in any one year eight and three-quarters mills for each one
dollar of assessed valuation. Of said total maximum levy, an amount shall
annually be levied sufficient to pay the interest, sinking fund and retirement
charges on all notes and bonds of the Municipality heretofore or hereafter
issued without the authority of the electors which are payable from general
taxes, except special assessment notes and bonds, which levy shall be placed
before and in preference to all other levies and for the full amount thereof.
Of the remaining portion of said total maximum levy, a levy not to exceed one-
half of a mill shall be made for the purpose of acquiring or improving parks,
playgrounds and other recreational facilities having an estimated useful life
of five years or more, the unexpended proceeds of which levy may be accumulated
from year to year; and the balance of said total maximum levy not in excess of
eight and one-quarter mills may be levied annually for any other lawful
municipal purpose including the levy required by law for police and firemen's
relief and pension funds.
   Additionally, to the above aggregate amount of taxes that may be levied by
the Council, without a vote of the people on property assessed and listed for
taxation according to value for all purposes of the Municipality, there shall
be a levy of one mill for the purpose of Fire Department operations and a levy
of a similar one mill for the purpose of Fire Department capital improvements,
fire apparatus and equipment, and Fire Department buildings, which shall be
levied for each one dollar of assessed valuation, the unexpended proceeds of
which levies may be accumulated from year to year.
   The limitation of this Charter upon the power of Council to levy taxes shall
not operate as a limitation upon the power of Council to levy taxes upon such
other subjects and for such other purposes as may be lawful under the
Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, nor shall the authority of Council
to submit additional levies to a vote of the people under the authority of the
Constitution or laws of the State of Ohio be deemed impaired or abridged by
reason of any provision of this Charter. (Amended 11-5-85.)
SECTION X-3. Termination of Certain Existing Levies.
(Repealed 11-3-92.)
SECTION X-4. Submission of Extra Levy.
   The Council may, at any time at least sixty days prior to a November
election, declare by resolution, adopted by a vote of two-thirds of all the
members thereof, that the amount of taxes which may be raised within the
limitation of Section 2 of this article will be insufficient to provide an
adequate amount for the necessary requirements of the City for current
operating expenses, and other expenses payable from the general fund of the
City, and such permanent improvements and equipment as shall have an estimated
useful life of five years or more, and that it is necessary to levy taxes in
excess of such limitation, in addition to the levies authorized and limited by
Section 2 of this article, for the municipal purpose or purposes specified in
such resolution. Such resolution shall specify the additional rate which it is
necessary to levy, the purpose or purposes thereof, the number of years during
which such rate shall be in effect which shall be not more than five years, and
the date of the proposed election thereon. Such resolution shall be effective
upon its adoption and shall be certified within five days thereafter to the
election authorities, who shall place such question upon the ballot at the next
succeeding November election. If a majority of those voting thereon vote for
the approval of such additional levy, the Council shall, for a period not in
excess of that prescribed in such resolution, make such levy, or such part
thereof as it finds necessary, pursuant to such approval and certify the same
to the county auditor, to be placed on the tax list and collected as other
taxes.
SECTION X-5. Refuse Collection Charge.
(Repealed 11-3-92.)

the performance of their duties until provision shall have been otherwise made
in accordance with this Charter for the performance or discontinuance of the
duties of any such office. When such provision shall have been made, the term
of any such officer or member shall expire and his office be deemed abolished.
The powers which are conferred and the duties which are imposed upon any
officer, commission, board or department of the Municipality under the laws of
the State, or under any ordinance or contract of the Municipality in force on

authorization of public improvements or the levy of assessments therefor.
Except as a contrary intent appears herein, all acts of the Council of the
Municipality shall continue in effect until lawfully amended or repealed.
SECTION XI-5. Salaries, Compensation and Bonds.
   The Council shall have the power to fix the salaries of its members and of
all other officers and employees of the Municipality, whether elected or

necessary for the faithful discharge of their duties. The premium of any bond
required by the Council shall be paid by the Municipality. The salary of an

his office and any such contract shall be voidable at the option of Council.
SECTION XI-7. Effect of Partial Invalidity.
   A determination that any part of this Charter is invalid shall not

after such appointment, recommend to Council such alterations, revisions, and
amendments, if any, to this Charter, as in its judgment are desirable.  The
Council shall submit to the electors not later than the next succeeding general
election any such proposed alterations, revisions, or amendments. The members
appointed to said Commission shall serve without compensation. Meetings of the
Charter Review Commission shall be open to the public.  (Amended 11-4-97.)
SECTION XI-10. Interpretation.
   The article and section headings herein have been inserted for convenience
in reference and are not intended to define or limit the scope of, or otherwise

the Council, the multiplicand shall be seven reduced by the number of vacancies
then existing in the Council.
SECTION XI-11. Rural Water Service.

description, however, lands which are currently provided with water service by
Vermilion.
   With respect to such lands, the Council of the City of Vermilion by duly
enacted ordinance or ordinances shall take, immediately upon the adoption of

and Section 6119.05 thereof, to make application for the inclusion of such
lands in the regional water district operated or to be operated by the Erie/
Huron County Rural Water Authority.  The ordinance(s) shall further provide
that the Erie/Huron County Rural Water Authority be permitted to use the
existing casing pipe under State Route Two at Claus and Sunnyside Roads, for
purposes of transporting water to such lands.  The ordinance(s) required herein
shall not be referred by Council to any of its Committee(s), shall not require
three readings prior to passage and shall go into effect immediately upon
passage.
   If any conflict exists between other provisions of this Charter and this
section, then this section shall prevail.  If any individual provisions or
requirements of this section are declared by judicial authority to be void or
unenforceable, the remaining portions shall remain intact.

Ordinances does not, except as provided in subsection (c) hereof:
(1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action taken

previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.

(Ord. 85-84.  Passed  12-16-85.)
   222.03  INVESTMENT POLICY.
   It is the policy of the City  of Vermilion, Ohio, to invest public funds in
a manner that will provide the highest investment return with maximum security,
safety and preservation of principal, while meeting the cash flow demands of
the City and conforming to applicable laws governing the investment of public
funds by an Ohio municipality. The  Finance Director  is the investment officer
for the City, charged with the responsibility of the implementation and
compliance with this Investment Policy.
   (a)   Scope.  This Investment Policy applies to all financial assets of the
City, including State and federal funds held by it.  Any practice not clearly
authorized under this policy is prohibited.
   (b)   Objectives.  The primary objectives, in order of their priority, of
the City's investment activities shall be:
      (1)   Safety:  Safety of principal is the foremost objective  of the
investment program. City  investments should be undertaken in a manner that
seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain
this objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on
individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of
the portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity:  The City's investment portfolio should remain
sufficiently liquid to enable it to meet anticipated cash outlay requirements.
      (3)   Return on Investment:  The City's investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account this Investment Policy and
the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
      (4)   Prudence: 
         A.   Investments shall be made with judgment and care  –  under
circumstances then prevailing –  which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, for investment
and not for speculation, considering both the probable safety of  their capital
and the income to be derived.
         B.   The standard of prudence to be used by the  Finance Director 
shall be the "prudent person"standard and shall be applied in the context of
managing the overall portfolio. Acting in accordance with this Investment
Policy and exercising due diligence will relieve the  Finance Director  of any
personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market
price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported to  City 
Council in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse
developments.
   (c)   Delegation of Authority and Responsibilities. The City may engage the
services of an investment advisor to assist in the management of the  City's
investment portfolio in a manner consistent with the City's objectives. Such
investment advisor may be granted discretion to purchase and sell investment
securities in accordance with this investment policy. The investment advisor
must be licensed by the division of securities under  Ohio Revised Code section
1707.141  or registered with the Securities & Exchange Commission, and
possesses experience in public funds investment management specifically in the
area of state and local government investment portfolios, or the investment
advisor is an eligible institution as mentioned in  Ohio Revised Code section
of 135.03.
   (d)   Authorized Financial Institutions and Dealers.
      (1)   The  Finance Director  will maintain a list of financial
institutions and approved security broker/dealers  who are authorized to
provide investment services and who qualify under Section 135.14(M)(1) of the
Revised Code. These may include "primary" dealers or regional dealers that
qualify under SEC Rule 15c3-1 and are registered with the Ohio Department of
Commerce to do business in the State.
      (2)   All financial institutions, broker/dealers and other entities who
desire to conduct investment business  with the City  must sign this Investment
Policy,  certifying they have read it, understand it and agree to abide by its
contents.
   (e)   Authorized Investments.  The City is  permitted to invest in any
security authorized by Ohio Revised Code section 135.14 and any other relevant
sections, as amended.  Those securities include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   United States Treasury bills, notes, bonds or any other obligation
or security issued  or guaranteed  by the United States Treasury or any other
obligation  of  which the faith of the United States is pledged for payment of
the  principal and interest  thereon  (not including "stripped" principal or
interest obligations).
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations or securities issued
by  any federal government agency or instrumentality, including but not limited
to the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal
Farm Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government
National Mortgage Association. All such securities must be direct issuances of
the federal government agency or instrumentality.
      (3)   Interim deposits in duly authorized depositories of the City,
provided those deposits are properly insured or collateralized as required by
law. This includes investments in Certificates of Deposit with FDIC insurance
coverage on the full amount of deposit plus accrued interest administered
through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).
Eligibility of this investment is outlined in  Ohio Revised Code  section
135.144 and would also apply to any other program that is deemed to meet the
requirements of such statute.
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of the State of Ohio, or the political
subdivisions of this state  provided that with  respect  to bonds or other
         obligations of political subdivisions, all of the following apply:
         A.   The bonds or other obligations are payable  from general revenues
of the political subdivision and backed by the full faith and credit of the
political subdivision.
         B.   The bonds or other obligations are rated at the time of purchase
in the three highest classifications established by at least one nationally
recognized standard rating service and are purchased
            through a registered securities broker or dealer.
         C.   The aggregate value of the bonds or other obligations does not
exceed 20% of the City's interim funds at the time of purchase.
         D.   The City is not the sole purchaser of the bonds or other
obligations at original issuance.
      (5)   No-load money market mutual funds consisting exclusively of
securities described in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Section and repurchase
agreements secured by such obligations, provided that  investments in
securities described in this Section are made only through eligible
institutions as described in Ohio Revised Code section 135.03.
      (6)   Ohio Subdivision's Fund (STAR Ohio)  and  the STAR Plus Federally
Insured Cash Account.

of the agreement between the parties for a period not to exceed 30 days with
any  eligible institution mentioned in  Ohio Revised Code  Section 135.03  or a

which agreement, the Finance Director purchases and such institution agrees
unconditional to repurchase any securities listed in division 1 or 2 of this
section that will mature or are redeemable within five years of the date of
purchase. The  market value of the securities subject to the repurchase

   (g)   Safekeeping and Custody.
      (1)   All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase

      (Ord. 2018-50.  Passed 9-10-18.)
   222.04  CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this policy it to ensure that City credit
card accounts (such as American Express, Visa, Best Buy, Lowes) are closely
monitored to provide for maximum security and to guard against misuse and/or
losses for which the City may be held liable. This policy is meant to comply
with the mandates of Sub HB 312 enacted by the 132nd General Assembly. The
City's credit card accounts are NOT for personal use, and City-issued credit
cards will not be permitted to be carried by personnel on a regular basis for
any reason. All City credit card accounts shall be in the name of the "City of
Vermilion, Ohio."
   (b)   "Credit Card Account" defined.  The term "credit card account" shall
mean any bank-issued credit card account, store-issued credit card account,
financial institution-issued credit card account, financial depository-issued
credit card account, affinity credit card account, or any other card account
allowing the holder to purchase goods or services on credit or to transact with
the account, and any debit or gift card account related to the receipt of grant
moneys. It does not include a procurement card account, gasoline or telephone
credit card account, or any other card account where merchant category codes
are in place as a system of control for use of the card account.
   (c)   General Guidelines.
      (1)   City credit cards are to be kept in the possession and control of
the Fiscal Officer. The Fiscal Officer will secure the credit cards in a safe,
or in a locked cash box in a secure drawer.
      (2)   The Fiscal Officer must keep a master list of all persons who are
authorized to use City credit cards, along with each person's title, and a
master list of cards (and the names that appear on each card, if applicable).
      (3)   A log of the card name showing date, sign out time, sign in time,
signature of person using the card, and valid purchase order number is to be
kept by the Fiscal Officer. The Fiscal Officer must initial each entry on the
log indicating approval of the card's use and the purchase. Persons needing to
use a Village credit card must go to the Fiscal Officer and sign the card in
and out on this log.
      (4)   Regular purchase order policy and procedures must be followed for
all credit card purchases. Every credit card purchase must have a valid
purchase order assigned to it before the purchase is legal. The purchase order
must contain the vendor and provide descriptions, account numbers and estimated
dollar amounts.
      (5)   City credit cards shall have a credit limit of Ten Thousand Dollars
and No Cents ($10,000.00). No single credit card purchase shall exceed the
credit card limit without prior written authorization from the Fiscal Officer.
This will assure that sufficient appropriations exist to cover the anticipated
charges. 
      (6)   Once an itemized detailed invoice and/or receipt is received, it
shall be submitted with a copy of the P.O. directly to the Fiscal Officer's
office to complete the transaction and pay the invoice.
   (d)   Policy Administration.
      (1)   Management of credit card accounts.

         A.   Review all credit card transaction and management reports to
ensure that the credit card accounts are being used appropriately.
         B.   Ensure all transactions are marked "Viewed" and "Approved" in the
system prior to mapping into the General Ledger.

all persons authorized to use City-issued credit cards.
   (f)   Rules and Procedures for Use. 
      (1)   The card is for City business expenses only. It must not be used
for personal purchases.
      (2)   The card is not transferable. It may be used by the Cardholder
only.
      (3)   Itemized receipts must be obtained for all transactions and

      (6)   Cardholders are responsible for resolving discrepancies and
ensuring credits are received.
      (7)   Cardholders may not receive cash back or in-store credits for any

seeing that all granting agency requirements are fulfilled.
      (10)   Cardholders may not make purchases that violate City policy
restricting business transactions that may be perceived as a conflict of
interest (purchases from a business in which you or a relative have a financial
interest). 
   (g)   Documentation Requirements.  Cardholders should always obtain an
itemized receipt for each transaction. If a cash register tape does not have
descriptions, write them on the tape.  Any transaction without a properly
substantiated receipt is subject to reimbursement of the City by the Cardholder
that made the purchase.
   A receipt is defined as an invoice, cash register receipt, sales slip, or
packing slip which contains an itemized list of goods purchased, with dollar

      (8)   Weapons or ammunition
      (9)   Donations

immediately notify the Fiscal Officer or his/her designee if a card is damaged,
lost, stolen or the subject of suspected fraudulent activity.
   (k)   Misuse of Cards.
      (1)   Cardholders are responsible for safeguarding the card. If misuse of
the card is discovered, disciplinary action up to and including discharge from
employment is possible. In the event of misuse of a City credit card account,
the City may pursue legal prosecution.

(Ord. 2019-4.  Passed 1-28-19.)
   222.05  DEBT POLICY.
   (a)   Debt Issuance Policies.
      (1)   Reliance on current revenues to finance operations. The City will
use current revenues to meet daily operations and working capital needs. The
City will not issue any debt to fund its operations.
      (2)   Reliance on current revenues vs. debt to finance capital
improvements. The City plans to use current revenues to pay for short-term
capital projects, repair and maintenance items and plans to reserve long-term
debt for capital improvements with useful lives of ten years or more and
special assessment projects.
      (3)   Promote economic development. The City will monitor opportunities
to foster economic development through the use of its debt capacity. This
effort may include the consideration of tax increment financings, assisting
with industrial revenue bonds and the use of special assessment debt.
      (4)   Use of outside funding sources for capital projects. The City will
pursue all known outside funding sources, for example local, state or federal
grant or low interest loan programs, before issuing debt. Where outside funding
is available only on a matching basis, the City will attempt to maximize the
leverage of its available cash and debt resources.
      (5)   Parameters for annual note issues. Bond anticipation notes may be
issued as necessary during the construction or acquisition phases of capital
projects or to finance on-going capital needs of the City that exceed current
revenue sources. Notes may be renewed and remain outstanding until the projects
are complete and final costs are known or can be reasonably estimated. At that
time, bonds will be issued to retire the notes, unless market conditions
warrant that the debt remain in notes. For amounts remaining in notes, the
City's goal is to annually pay down the maximum amount allowable within the
budget, but not less than five percent of the outstanding note balance.
      (6)   Selection of outside service providers for debt issues.
Professional service providers (underwriters, municipal advisors, bond
registrars, paying agents, trustees, escrow agents, bond insurers, etc.)
selected in connection with the City's debt issues will be selected according
to the City's procurement policies. In most cases this will require a request
for proposal process. The objectives of the process will be to:
         A.   Promote competition;
         B.   Be as objective as possible;
         C.   Incorporate clear and rational selection criteria;
         D.   Be independent of political influence;
         E.   Be perceived as fair by the respondents;
         F.   Result in a cost-effective transaction;
         G.   Result in the selection of the most qualified firm(s).
      (7)   Bond structuring considerations. Bond amortization schedules will
be structured to minimize interest expense within the constraints of revenues
available for debt service. The structure may include features such as serial
and term bonds, original issue discounts, premiums and mandatory sinking funds
in any configuration that enhances the marketability of the bonds in order to
minimize the total cost of the financing. The bonds should include call
features to maximize the City's ability to advance refund or retire the debt
early. However, the call features should be balanced with market conditions to
ensure that the total cost of financing is not adversely affected.
      (8)   Use of variable rate debt. The City will monitor interest rate
markets and may use variable rate debt for long-term capital improvements if
conditions warrant.
      (9)   Debt not to exceed useful life of assets. The City will not issue
debt for any capital improvement for a term that exceeds the useful life of
that improvement.
      (10)   Credit enhancement considerations. For each debt issue, the City
will analyze the potential economic benefit of utilizing credit enhancement
(bond insurance, bank letters of credit, etc.) and will pursue such enhancement
provided cost savings are obtainable. Further, the City will only pursue credit
enhancement from companies that maintain the highest possible rating by
nationally recognized rating agency(ies) for their products.
      (11)   Use of derivative products. The City may use derivative products
to reduce interest costs, enhance the efficiency of debt service reserve funds
and escrow accounts, or reduce market risk exposures. Should derivative
products be used, a description of the risks and potential rewards of a
derivative product must be provided, in writing, before the structure is
selected. Both the City's Law Director and bond counsel must review the
transaction to ensure that the City is authorized to enter into the necessary
agreements under all existing statutes and administration policies.
      (12)   Method of sale for bonds and notes. The City will determine, on an
issue by issue basis, the most advantageous method of sale. The City will
generally follow the Government Finance Officers Association guidelines for
selecting the method of sale (these guidelines are outlined in the City's Long-
Term Financing Plan). If the sale is to be competitive, the City may consider
engaging a municipal advisor to assist with the sale.
   (b)   Debt Management Policies.
      (1)   Revenues committed to fund capital projects. To minimize the need
for issuing debt, the City will strive to commit ten percent of property taxes
raised from the balance of available inside millage, to capital. These revenues
will be used to fund annual capital projects, as well as to meet debt service
requirements and pay down on outstanding debt.
      (2)   Enhance year-to-year financial stability. The City will prepare
annually a five-year projection of revenues and expenditures in order to
enhance year-to-year financial stability and to better analyze the need to
issue debt. Included with the projections will be a determination as to whether
the City should modify the portion of general fund revenues dedicated to
financing capital improvements.
      (3)   Annual preparation of Capital Improvements Plan (CIP). The City
will produce a five-year capital improvement plan and update the plan annually.
The plan will remain flexible to permit changes in project priorities. Debt
will be issued in accordance with CIP as necessary.
      (4)   Credit rating. If appropriate, the City will pursue a credit rating
for individual debt issues. The City will work to maintain and improve its
potential long-term debt credit, provided this effort is consistent with good
fiscal management policies. The City does not currently believe it would be
cost effective to pursue ratings from multiple agencies but will continue to
monitor the market to determine whether additional ratings provide economic
benefit in the occurrence of a new debt issuance. The City will consider having
bond anticipation note issues rated if doing so will provide economic benefit.
      (5)   Bond and note retirement. The City will retire all debt on or
before the maturity date.
      (6)   Debt limitations compliance. The City will fully comply with all
statutory debt limitations imposed by the Ohio Revised Code or City ordinance,
and those developed by the Administration. Since overlapping sub-divisions have
an impact on the City's debt limitations, the City will monitor the impact of
debt issued by overlapping entities and initiate discussions with those issuers
should the City's debt limit become adversely affected.
      (7)   Arbitrage compliance. The City will fully comply with all arbitrage
rebate requirements of the federal tax code and Internal Revenue Service
regulations and will perform arbitrage rebate calculations for each issue
subject to rebate, on an annual basis. All necessary rebates will be filed and
paid when due.
      (8)   Reserve millage. The City's goal will be to maintain a one mill
inside millage reserve for emergencies. Based on 2019 assessed valuation
figures, this amounts to approximately one million fourteen thousand five
hundred thirty-nine dollars ($1,014,539) of annual debt service capacity, or a
thirteen million seven hundred fifty thousand dollar ( $13,750,000) bond issued
for twenty years at four percent.
      (9)   Bank qualified status. The City will manage its bank qualified debt
issuance status carefully. Should conduit issuers request access to the City's
tax-exempt issuance capabilities, the City will analyze the impact of the
request on its bank qualified status and its debt issuance plans, then
determine whether to negotiate a fee with the conduit issuer that would "make
the City whole" for the conduit issue causing the City to lose its bank
qualified status in any given year.
      (10)   Investment of bond proceeds. The City will invest bond proceeds
according to its general investment of funds policies.
      (11)   Bond retirement fund. The City will maintain a segregated bond
retirement fund to provide for principal and interest payment on its debt. The
City's goal will be to maintain a fund balance adequate to meet current
obligations.
      (12)   Debt service reserve funds. The City will maintain a segregated
debt service reserve funds for revenue issues as required by any trust and/or
indenture agreements.
      (13)   Refunding criteria. The City will monitor its debt portfolio for
refunding opportunities on a regular basis. The City will consider refunding's
for various reasons, including to:
         A.   Achieve interest rate savings in a declining interest rate
environment,
         B.   Update covenants on outstanding debt which impair efficient
operations,
         C.   Restructure the pattern of debt service associated with
outstanding bond issues; and
         D.   Alter bond characteristics, such as call provisions or payment
dates, on existing debt.
         If the City pursues a refinancing for interest rate savings, it should
initiate the transaction (select method of sale, engage outside service
providers and begin Preliminary Official Statement preparation) when the
present value savings exceed two percent of the par amount of the outstanding
issue (inclusive of all costs of issuance). Generally, the City may execute the
refunding once present value savings exceed three percent of the outstanding
par.
      (14)   External reporting. The City will provide rating agencies,
national information repositories such as the Electronic Municipal Market
Access (EMMA) and other interested parties with current versions of its CAFR in
a timely manner. The City will remain in compliance and file reports in
accordance with Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative
(MCDC). The City plans to include all information required by the Security and
Exchange Commission's rule 15c2-12(b)(5) in the statistical section of the
CAFR, unless this information is otherwise available in the form of a current
Annual Information Statement or Official Statement prepared in connection with
the issuance of debt. In addition, the City's debt limitations will be updated
at least annually and reported in the statistical section of the CAFR.
      (15)   Debt policy responsibility and maintenance. The debt policies are
considered administration policies will be modified by the Administration, from
time to time, as deemed necessary. However, the policies are the primary
responsibility of the Finance Director. The policies shall be reviewed annually
during the Capital Improvements Plan preparation process and should be updated
at that time as necessary.

interest rates on municipal bonds are lower that interest rates on other types
of bonds, but when taking into account a bondholder's income taxes, often
provide a comparable, or better, rate of return.

exist); and Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption (Usually derived from insurance
proceeds after destruction of project collateral).
      (89)   Refunding Bond: They are the bonds used in a refinancing to
replace a bond issue with a new bond issue. Usually a new bond issue will
refund an outstanding issue to achieve conditions more favorable to the issuer,
such as reduced interest rate or more favorable borrowing conditions like the
removal of liens. With "Current Refunding" bonds must be called within ninety
days of the earliest call date applicable to IDBs. "Advance Refunding"
establish a procedure where an issuer refinances an outstanding bond, typically
far in advance of the first call date. The proceeds of new bonds are deposited
in an escrow to pay debt service on outstanding bonds, called the "refunded
bond." Revenues that were pledged to the outstanding bond to pay debt service
are in turn, used to make debt service payments on the new bonds called
"refunding bonds."
      (90)   Revenue Anticipatory Debt: It is a method of improving cash flows

borrowing cost, interest cost is defined as the rate, compounded semiannually,
necessary to discount the amounts payable on the respective principal and
interest maturity dates to the purchase price received for bonds; i.e. an
internal rate of return calculation. Unlike NIC, TIC takes into account the

should be awarded on the basis of the lowest TIC bid, most are awarded based on
the lowest NIC bid.

vacation to which the employee is entitled. All of these employees shall have
served for a period of at least one year.
   (g)   In the Police Division, only vacation time which is unused in the year
in which it is earned, due to the deployment of manpower requirements by

further, that carry-over weeks shall be the first weeks utilized for vacation
credit in a succeeding anniversary year.

or incur sickness while in the discharge of their duties, and the provisions of
this section may be waived by motion duly passed by Council to allow additional
sick leave to such employees, but in no case shall such additional sick leave
exceed in all more than one year. In meritorious cases, each case to be
considered on its own facts, the provisions of this section may also be waived
in the same manner to allow such additional sick leave, whether or not the
injury occurred or the sickness was incurred while in the discharge of duty. In
either such case, a certificate of a physician approved by Council must be
furnished.  (Ord. 81-48.  Passed 9-21-81.)

additional one-half of one percent, up to and including a maximum of five and
one-half percent of their annual base pay. For example:
 
Years of Service Percent of Annual Base Pay
5                1
6                1-1/2
7                2

   252.13  GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any full-time City employee represented in a bargaining unit or by a
union may avail himself or herself of the grievance procedure set forth in this
section if a real and substantive controversy arises pertaining to working
conditions. No frivolous or meaningless grievance which does not have the
effect of resolving day to day working conditions shall be filed, nor shall any
grievance be filed that is reserved and protected as management rights under
existing bargaining contracts with any official employee union or
representative group. Union representatives shall not file a grievance if they
determine that the same is mute, meaningless, earlier resolved or within the
rights granted to management. Once a grievance is perfected pursuant to this
section, it shall take precedence over grievances governing the same or related
subject matter filed by the same grievant or his or her representative under a
negotiated contract, meaning that the contract provisions shall be waived by
the grievant in favor of the procedures set forth in this section.
   (b)   The authority of stewards and alternates duly designated by a union
shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the following duties and activities:
(1)   Stewards and alternates shall investigate and present grievances with the
employer.
(2)   Stewards and alternates shall represent employees in the grievance
procedure and during conferences.
(3)   A steward shall have a reasonable amount of time during working hours,
without any loss of pay, for the investigation and adjustment of grievances and
attendance at meetings during working hours, when such meetings are requested
by the Director of Public Service or the Employee Relations Committee.
(4)   A steward shall be permitted to leave work, after reporting to his or her
supervisor, for the purpose of handling grievances or other legitimate
representation functions. The privilege of stewards leaving their work during
working hours, without loss of pay, is subject to the understanding that the
time shall be devoted to proper representation functions and shall not be
abused.
   (c)   An employee may process his or her grievance through the State Board
of Personnel Review appeals procedure or the contract grievance procedure. If
an appeal is filed under the Board appeals procedure, the employee shall not be
entitled to institute proceedings under the contract grievance procedure, all
rights to do so being waived by the exercise of an option by the employee to
utilize the Board procedure. If an appeal is filed with the Board while
proceedings are taking place under the contract grievance procedure, then the
contract grievance procedure shall cease and shall not be permitted to be
reinstituted. It shall be the policy of a union to encourage its members to
elect the grievance procedure set forth herein, as follows:
(1)   The employee, either alone or accompanied by the unit steward, shall
present the grievance, orally or in writing, to his or her immediate supervisor
within five working days of the date of its occurrence or when the employee
knew or by reasonable diligence should have known of its occurrence. However,
in a group grievance, only one of the grievants shall attend a grievance
meeting. The supervisor shall make a careful inquiry into the complaint and
attempt to resolve the problem promptly and fairly. He or she shall give his or
her decision, orally or in writing, to the employee within three working days
of its presentation.
(2)   If the grievance is not settled by the procedure set forth in paragraph
(c)(1) hereof the appeal shall be made in writing by the employee and signed by
the grievant and unit steward. The grievant's written appeal shall be presented
to the Director of Public Service within five working days after the
supervisor's response is received.
      Upon receipt of the grievance, the Director shall set a place and time
during working hours, within five working days, for a hearing of the grievance
with the aggrieved employee. The unit steward and a union representative may
represent the employee at the meeting.
      The Director, upon receiving the written appeal, shall respond, in
writing, to the employee and the unit steward, within five working days after
the hearing.
(3)   If the grievance is not settled by the procedure set forth in paragraph
(c)(2) hereof, the employee, unit steward or staff representative shall, within
five working days after the answer is due, request, through the Employee
Relations Committee, a meeting to take place within five working days from the
date the request is received. In attendance at this meeting, for the employer,
shall be the Mayor, the Director and the Committee and/or their
representatives. Representing the employee shall be the four designated unit
stewards and not more than two staff union representatives.
      The answer of the Committee shall be put in writing within five working
days after such meeting. The employee shall indicate to the Committee, in
writing, whether the answer is accepted or rejected, within five working days.
(4)   If the grievance is not settled by the procedure set forth in paragraph
(c)(3) hereof, the union, within five working days of the date of the
employer's answer in paragraph (c)(3) hereof, may make a request, in writing,
to the Committee, for fact-finding in accordance with Chapter
274.
   (d)   No grievance shall be considered or processed unless it is filed
within the time limits and in the manner prescribed in each step of the
grievance procedure set forth in this section. If a grievance is not filed
within the time limits or is improperly filed, the employer has no obligation
to accept to process it and it shall not be reinstituted.  If a grievance is
not appealed within the time limits prescribed for appeal, it shall be deemed
settled on the basis of the last answer of the employer, provided that the
parties may agree to extend any time limit.  If the employer fails to provide
an answer within the time limits so provided, the employee may immediately
appeal to the next step in the grievance procedure.
 
   (e)   Both the union and the employer have the right to call such witnesses
as are necessary in the investigation of a grievance.  The union shall submit a
list of its witnesses, who are employees, not later than two working days prior
to a grievance meeting.  (Ord. 79-82.  Passed 12-17-79.)

         C.   The employee, department head and the Mayor or Public Service
Director (or respective appointing authority) must sign the reimbursement form,
specifically initialing any reimbursement exceptions.
   (c)   Frequent Flyer Miles.
      (1)   It is the recommendation of the Finance Director that the cost to
implement a policy to control frequent flyer miles would exceed any benefit to
the City from the accumulation of the miles.
      (2)   City employees rarely utilize airlines, have no consistent airline
assigned, and any miles accumulated are in the name of the individual employee
not the City. 
      (3)   If, at any point in the future, it is found that employees fly
consistently to the same destination, using the same airline and accumulate a
significant amount (25,000 or more) of frequent flyer miles, then the Finance
Director will establish a written policy and procedure for this action.
         (Ord. 2010-74.  Passed 12-6-10.)
   252.15  EMPLOYEES' SALARY REDUCTION-TAX SHELTERED ANNUITY RETIREMENT PLAN.
   (a)   Employee Defined.  For the purpose of this section, "employee" means
any person, whether appointed, elected or under contract, providing services
for the City for which compensation is paid.
   (b)   Purpose.  The purpose of the Employee's Salary Reduction-Tax Sheltered
Annuity Retirement Plan is to make available to City employees, City officers
and independent contractors who qualify, a salary reduction system affording a
tax sheltered annuity program to augment the participant's security during
retirement years.
 
   (c)   Salary Reduction Agreement.  The Mayor is hereby authorized to enter
into an agreement with City employees, City officers or independent contractors
who qualify for this Plan, whereby the participant may designate a portion of
his or her future earnings to be deducted by the City and placed in an
accumulated fund calculated to provide tax sheltered annuity benefits to the
participant upon his or her retirement.  Such agreement shall include, but not
be limited to, specifications that:
(1)   No City funds shall be contributed to the Plan.
(2)   The City may amend the provisions of this Plan at any time, provided,
however, that no amendment shall affect the rights of participants or their
beneficiaries to the receipt of payment of benefits, to the extent of any
compensation deferred at the time of the amendment as adjusted for investment
experience hereunder prior to and subsequent to the amendment.
(3)   The City shall not be responsible for any loss due to the investment or
failure of investment of funds and assets in the Plan, nor shall the City be
required to replace any loss whatsoever which may result from such investments
or failure to make investments.
(4)   All funds and assets, together with interest, accumulations and
increments thereon, in the Employee's Salary Reduction Tax-Sheltered Annuity
Account, shall remain an asset of the employee and be subject to the employee's
ownership until such time as the funds or assets of such Account are
distributed to the participant in accordance with the provisions of the
agreement.
(5)   The City may elect to purchase a variable annuity contract or other asset
in connection with the liabilities assumed by it hereunder.
(6)   The obligation of the City to the participant for the payment of
distributions and increments thereon referred to in the agreement are deemed a
contractual obligation only, and the participant shall have no preferred or
special interest by way of trust, escrow, annuity of otherwise, in and to the
specified assets or funds in the Employee's Salary Reduction-Tax Sheltered
Annuity Account.
   (d)   Administration.  The accumulated fund of this Plan shall be
administered by an insurance company doing business in the State and authorized
by Council to:
(1)   Oversee and administer the investment of moneys in the accumulated fund
in a manner reasonably calculated to accomplish the intent and purposes of the
agreement between the employer and the participant, including, but not limited
to, purchase of annuity contracts on behalf of the City;
(2)   Coordinate activities with the City to handle the variable annuity
program to be used to implement the functioning of the Plan;
(3)   Make periodic reviews and analyses at such reasonable intervals as may be
required to satisfy the City that the Plan is being operated in a manner
reasonably calculated to accomplish its objectives, or to recommend to the City
corrective measures which may be indicated; and
(4)   Assist the City in the making of judgments in the administration of the
Plan wherein the City's decision shall be made in an even-handed manner,
treating all persons in similar circumstances alike.
           
   (e)   Accounts.
(1)   Generally. The accounting and financial records shall be maintained in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by both the City and
the insurance company.
(2)   Maintenance. The Finance Director and his or her designees shall maintain
the accounting records and establish such ledger accounts as are necessary and
appropriate to the efficient operation of the Plan from the City's perspective.
(3)   Accumulated fund. Salary reductions shall be accumulated in a fund to be
known as the Employees' Salary-Reduction Tax Sheltered Annuity Plan, with such
disbursements or transfer of funds in such account as may be directed by the
terms of the employer-participant agreement or as authorized by the City and
the insurance carrier.
   (Ord. 82-11.  Passed 2-15-82.)
           
   (f)   Effect Upon Other Benefits and Taxes. The deferred compensation
program established by this section shall exist and serve in addition to the
retirement, pension or benefits system established by the City, and no deferral
of income under the deferred compensation program shall effect a reduction of
any retirement, pension or other benefit provided by law. However, any sum
deferred under the deferred compensation program shall not be included for the
purposes of computation of any taxes withheld on behalf of any such employee.
However, the tax imposed by the Municipal income tax shall also be levied upon
any and all compensation since deferred under this section for the reason that,
at the time of disbursement, such funds of City employees and the funds herein
sheltered shall otherwise likely escape Municipal income tax entirely.
(Ord. 82-53. Passed 8-16-82.)
   (g)   Transferability. Neither the participant nor his or her beneficiary
nor any other designee shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer
or otherwise convey the right to receive any payments under this Plan, which
payments and rights thereto are expressly declared to be nonassignable and
nontransferrable. In the event of any attempted assignment or transfer, the
City shall have no further liability under the Plan, nor shall any payments be
subject to attachment, garnishment or execution, or be transferrable by
operation of law in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, except to the extent
otherwise provided by law.  (Ord. 82-11.  Passed 2-15-82.)
   252.16   RETIREMENT PAY OUT OPTIONS.
   Any full-time employee of this City who has previously qualified for
bonafide public service pension benefits under a State approved fund, such as
the Public Employees Retirement System or the Police and Firemen's Disability
and Pension Fund, etc., may, at the option of such employee, apply for and
receive from the Finance Director a lump sum pay out of certain leave and cash

Finance Director shall thereafter be deemed final.
(Ord. 88-69.  Passed 11-21-88.)

employee. No person subject to this pick-up shall have the option of choosing
to receive the statutorily required contribution to the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio or the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension
Fund directly instead of having it picked up by the City of Vermilion or of
being excluded from the pick up.
   The City of Vermilion shall, in reporting and making remittance to the
Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio or the Police and Firemen's
Disability and Pension Fund, report that the public employee's contribution for
each person subject to this designated pick-up has been made as provided by
statute.
   (b)   The designated pick-up by the City of Vermilion, as provided by this
section, shall apply to all City employees who qualify for and contribute to
the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio or the Police and Fireman's
Disability and Pension Fund.
 
   (c)   If any employee herein is subject to a pick-up by the City of

Pension Fund other than as provided by this chapter, the pick-up provided in
subsection (a) hereof shall apply only to an amount equal to the difference

Vermilion other than as provided by this chapter.
 
   (d)   The gross wage or salary of any persons subject to the designated
pick-up provided by this chapter shall not change as a result of this pick-up.
 
   (e)   The Finance Director is hereby directed to implement the provisions of
this chapter to effect the designated pick-up of the statutorily required
contributions to the Public Employee Retirement System of Ohio or the Police
and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund for those employees established
herein so as to enable them to obtain the resulting Federal and State
deferments.
(Ord. 87-97.  Passed 12-7-87.)
   252.18  CITY VEHICLE POLICY.
   (a)   City vehicles will be permanently assigned to those departments which
have demonstrated a continuing need for them.  If City vehicles are assigned to
departments, then employees cannot use their personal vehicles for the purpose
of claiming a reimbursement.
   (b)   Employees who drive a vehicle on City business must possess a valid
driver's license and are responsible for making sure the vehicle is in proper
working order, and must obey all traffic laws including seat belt usage.  If an
employee is aware of a problem with a vehicle they are to immediately inform
their supervisor.  It is the supervisor's responsibility to assure that the
problem is corrected as soon as possible.  Employees are also responsible for
any fines or parking violations incurred as a result of driving.
   (c)   Employees are not permitted, under any circumstances, to operate a
City vehicle, or a personal vehicle for City business, when any physical or
mental impairment causes the employee to be unable to drive safely.  This
prohibition includes, but is not limited to, circumstances in which the
employee is temporarily unable to operate a vehicle safely or legally because
of illness, medication, or intoxication.
   (d)   Employees must report any accident involving a City vehicle or a
personal vehicle used on City business to their supervisor regardless of the
extent of damage or lack of injuries.  Such reports must be made as soon as
possible after the accident.  Employees are expected to cooperate fully with
the authorities in the event of an accident.  However, employees should make no
voluntary statement other than in reply to questions of investigating
officers.  If an accident occurs they have to report it immediately to the
supervisor who must report to the Mayor's office.
   (e)   Employer provided vehicle use:
      (1)   Due to their 24 hour a day on call status, certain department
members may have a City vehicle for commuting for the purpose of enhanced
response times.
      (2)   Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations state that employer
provided vehicles are taxable to the employee.  Exceptions are for clearly
marked police and fire vehicles, unmarked law enforcement vehicles, and marked
pickup trucks with mechanical equipment.  These departments will maintain
additional procedures in regards to their vehicles.
   (f)   No employee shall operate a city vehicle or a personal vehicle for
city business when their driver's license has been revoked or suspended by a
court of law, unless such court granted work privileges. 
   (g)   No employee shall smoke in a City owned vehicle. 
   (h)   Transportation.
      (1)   Each vehicle has its own practical purpose.  No vehicle should be
used for any purpose other than it was designed for, unless authorized by the
Mayor and/or his/her designee.
      (2)   All employees operating a vehicle to haul or with the capability of
hauling materials on public highways are to ensure their cargo is secured and
the vehicles Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) is not exceeded.
      (3)   Only City of Vermilion employees may operate City vehicles.  No
City vehicle is to be used for personal or private use without authorization by
the Mayor and/or his/her designee.
      (4)   Unless exempted by State law, vehicles rated at or above 26000 lbs.
Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) must be operated by employees with Commercial
Drivers Licenses (CDL) only.  A copy of their current driver's license must be
on file in their personnel file for insurance purposes.
      (5)   No employee is permitted to pick up or transport anyone not
employed by the City of Vermilion unless authorized by the department head.
         (Ord. 2010-75.  Passed 12-6-10.)
   252.19  CELLULAR PHONE POLICY.
   (a)   It is the city's policy to provide the highest standard of service to
our community.  Utilizing cellular phones improves the quality of service
delivered, employee productivity, and enhances business efficiencies. Cellular
technology provides assistance with disaster recovery, and offers portable
alternatives for immediate communication, enabling time and distance to be
managed more effectively. 
   (b)   Employees should utilize hands-free calling if available and exercise
common sense rules when cellular communication is necessary while operating a
vehicle.  For example, employees should keep conversations brief, avoid
unnecessary calls, and no calls should be made if driving is hazardous. 
Further, if the employee needs to read or write while taking the call, he/she
should pull off the road.  Texting while driving is prohibited. The city will
seek reimbursement for any additional charges resulting from personal calls. 
Misuse of a city cellular phone may result in its revocation and possible
disciplinary action.
   (c)   Cellular phone contract minutes should be the smallest plan available
to accommodate the particular business need.  The Mayor's office will keep a
list of all the authorized users of cell phones, and nobody shall be added to
the list, nor shall plan changes that increase the City's cost be made without
the Mayor's approval. 
   (d)   The Finance Department will charge the cost of cellular telephones
back to the appropriate department.
   (e)   Personal Use.  Employee are required to pay for costs incurred for
personal calls as follows: When personal calls/minutes cause the monthly plan
minutes to be exceeded, or long distance/roaming fees for personal calls,
reimbursement must be made to the city. Anytime the City's bill has additional
charges, the Mayor's office will send the billing statement to the user who
must review the statement and remit the full amount owed for personal calls
within 30 days of receipt of the monthly statement.  In those circumstances
when a city-owned cellular phone is not assigned to an individual but rather is
shared by more than one employee, all employees who make or receive any
personal calls on such phones shall retain a record of such calls including the
date, cellular telephone number, and inbound/outbound telephone number.  Such
employees shall then be required to reimburse the city for costs incurred as a
result of personal use as described above.
   (f)   Personal Cellular Phones.  While at work employees are expected to
exercise the same discretion in using personal cellular phones as is expected
for the use of city phones.  Personal calls are limited to emergency or
pressing reasons, preferably during breaks and meal periods.
   (g)   Violation.  Employees violating this policy may be subject to
disciplinary action according to departmental operating procedures and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
   (h)   Loss or Damage of Cellular Telephone.  The employees assigned a
cellular telephone are responsible for safeguarding the City's equipment. 
Consequently, loss or damage can result in the employee being charged for
replacement in accordance with the charges to the City from the cell phone
provider.

   274.01   ESTABLISHMENT.
   There is hereby established as a regular standing committee a new committee
designated as the Employee Relations Committee. Such Committee shall consist of
three members of Council with the Director of Finance serving in an advisory
capacity.
(Ord. 78-19.  Passed 2-6-78.)
   274.02   FUNCTIONS.
   The functions of the Employee Relations Committee are to:
   (a)   Make recommendations to Council concerning employee proposals,
relating to compensation, hours and working conditions, that may be submitted
to it in accordance with procedures established by Council and supplemented as
necessary by its own rules; and
   (b)   Adjudicate employee grievances as set forth in Section
252.13 of these Codified Ordinances and/or in any Agreement entered into by
Council and representatives of any class of Municipal employees, which
Agreements typically provide for compensation, benefits and conditions of
employment for such employees.
       
   274.03   FACT-FINDING PROCEDURES.
   (a)   If an employee organization is unwilling to accept recommendations
made to Council by the Employee Relations Committee, it may so advise the Mayor
and Council, in writing, of its objections to such recommendations and request
fact-finding. Council shall, at the next regular scheduled meeting, designate
one person as the City member of the Fact-Finding Authority and shall advise
the objecting employee organization of the name of such member. The objecting
party shall, within five days, designate one person as the employee member of
the Authority and shall advise the Mayor and the President of Council, in
writing, of the name of such member. The two designated members shall meet
within five days of their designation and shall attempt to agree upon an
impartial third person as Chairman of the Authority. They shall thereupon
jointly serve, in writing, upon the Mayor, Council and the objecting party, the
name of the Chairman so selected. If they are unable to agree upon an impartial
Chairman, they shall jointly or separately request a panel of five names from
the American Arbitration Association. The representatives of the City and of
the objecting employee organization involved shall alternately strike names
from the list until one name remains. The remaining name shall be the Chairman
of the Authority. Council shall, by ordinance, provide for the payment of one-
half of the compensation and reimbursement for expenses as may be appropriate
under the circumstances for members of the Authority. The objecting employee
organization shall provide for, and secure the payment of, the other half.
 
   (b)   The Chairman shall convene the Authority as soon after his or her
appointment as possible. Thereafter, a representative of the City and a
representative of the objecting employee organization involved shall submit his
or her respective positions to the Authority for its review and
recommendations. The Authority shall, within fifteen days, issue, in writing, a
fact-finding report. Such report shall be served upon the Committee, the
employee organization involved, the Mayor and the President of Council. As soon
after the receipt of such report as possible, the Committee and the objecting
employee organization shall meet again and seek to reach an agreement. If a
subsequent agreement is reached, it will be submitted to Council as a joint
recommendation for appropriate action. If an agreement is not reached within
fifteen days of the issuance of the report, unless the parties mutually agree
to extend the fifteen-day period, the report shall be submitted by the
President of Council, together with the respective positions of the City and
the objecting employee organization involved, to Council for its final
decision.
(Ord. 83-9. Passed 3-7-83.)
   (c)   "Employee organization," as used in this section, means any lawful
association, fraternal order, labor organization, federation, council or
brotherhood having as its primary purpose the improvement of working conditions
of public employees. The term does not include any organization which:
(1)   Discriminates with regard to the terms and conditions of membership
because of race, color, creed or national origin; and
(2)   In the opinion of Council, is so subject to corrupt influences or
influences opposed to basic democratic principles that recognition would be
inconsistent with the objectives of this chapter.
   (d)   To be recognized as an employee organization with the right to
represent Municipal employees in the manner prescribed in this chapter, any
such organization shall be prepared to establish, to the satisfaction of the
City, that it represents a majority of employees in an employment unit in the
City, the appropriateness of which unit has been determined by the City.

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

(ORC 4511.12)
   414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   414.03   TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
     Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall
have the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design,  separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right- of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
   (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
   
   414.04  LAND-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of- way
to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking
person signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical  technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive  days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving

The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or
(d) of this section has been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Ohio Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are
necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section.  This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state
law or municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any of those
subsections, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section do not apply to a
person who has registered with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in accordance
with division (c)(5) of this section.
      (5)   A person who has received an affidavit under division (c)(3) of
this section stating that the person has a permanent or reasonably expected to
be permanent physical impairment that makes use of an occupant restraining
device impossible or impracticable may register with the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles attesting to that fact. Upon such registration, the Registrar shall
make that information available in the law enforcement automated data system. A
person included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not
required to have the affidavit obtained in accordance with division (c)(3) of
this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton, or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a process for a person to be included in the
database under division (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and
included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not a public
record subject to inspection or copying under R.C. § 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.
   (e)   All fines collected for violations of subsection (b) hereof shall be

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
      (3)   As used in subsection (f)(2) of this section, “tort action” means a
civil action for damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property. 
“Tort action” includes a product liability claim that is subject to Ohio R.C.
2307.71 to 2307.80, but does not include a civil action for damages for a
breach of a contract or another agreement between persons.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates

section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
         (ORC 4513.263)
   438.30   IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
(1)   "Ignition interlock device" means a device that connects a breath
analyzer to a motor vehicle's ignition system, that is constantly available to
monitor the concentration by weight of alcohol in the breath of any person
attempting to start that motor vehicle by using its ignition system, and that
deters starting the motor vehicle by use of its ignition system unless the
person attempting to so start the vehicle provides an appropriate breath sample
for the device and the device determines that the concentration by weight of
alcohol in the person's breath is below a preset level.
(2)   "Offender with restricted driving privileges" means an offender who is
subject to an order that was issued under Ohio R.C. 4507.16(F) as a condition
of the granting of occupational driving privileges, or an offender whose
driving privilege is restricted as a condition of probation pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2951.02(I). 
   (b)   Except in cases of a substantial emergency when no other person is
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency, no person shall
knowingly rent, lease or lend a motor vehicle to any offender with restricted
driving privileges, unless the vehicle is equipped with a functioning ignition
interlock device that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.83(D).
 
   (c)   Any offender with restricted driving privileges who rents, leases or
borrows a motor vehicle from another person shall notify the person who rents,
leases or lends the motor vehicle to the offender that the offender has
restricted driving privileges and of the nature of the restriction. 
 
   (d)   Any offender with restricted driving privileges who is required to
operate a motor vehicle owned by the offender's employer in the course and
scope of the offender's employment may operate that vehicle without the
installation of an ignition interlock device, provided that the employer has
been notified that the offender has restricted driving privileges and of the
nature of the restriction, and provided, further, that the offender has proof
of the employer's notification in the offender's possession while operating the
employer's vehicle for normal business duties.  A motor vehicle owned by a
business that is partly or entirely owned or controlled by an offender with
restricted driving privileges is not a motor vehicle owned by an employer, for
purposes of this subsection.
   (e)   If a court, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4507.16(F), imposes the use of an
ignition interlock device as a condition of the granting of occupational
driving privileges, the court shall require the offender to provide proof of
compliance to the court at least once quarterly or more frequently as ordered
by the court in its discretion.  If a court imposes the use of an ignition
interlock device as a condition of probation under Ohio R.C. 2951.02(G), the
court shall require the offender to provide proof of compliance to the court or
probation officer prior to issuing any driving privilege or continuing the
probation status.  In either case in which a court imposes the use of such a
device, the offender, at least once quarterly or more frequently as ordered by
the court in its discretion, shall have the device inspected as ordered by the
court for accurate operation and shall provide the results of the inspection to
the court or, if applicable, to the offender's probation officer.
 
   (f)   No offender with restricted driving privileges, during any period that
the offender is required to operate only a motor vehicle equipped with an
ignition interlock device, shall request or permit any other person to breathe
into the device or start a motor vehicle equipped with the device, for the
purpose of providing the offender with an operable motor vehicle.
 
   (g)   Except as provided in subsection (h) hereof, no person shall breathe
into an ignition interlock device or start a motor vehicle equipped with an
ignition interlock device for the purpose of providing an operable motor
vehicle to an offender with restricted driving privileges.
 
   (h)    Subsection (g) hereof does not apply to an offender with restricted
driving privileges who breathes into an ignition interlock device or starts a
motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device for the purpose of
providing the offender with an operable motor vehicle.
 
   (i)   No unauthorized person shall tamper with or circumvent the operation
of an ignition interlock device.  (ORC 4511.83)
 
   (j)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be subject to
the penalty provided in Section

vans, and also including boats, boat trailers, motor homes, recreational
vehicles, camper trailers, and trailers, unless such property is confined to
the area to the rear or back of the regular building setback line, which
normally would be side yard or rear yard areas. However, the parking of
personal passenger cars and jeeps, Blazers, vans, Broncos or other similar
vehicles used for personal transportation shall be permitted in front yard
areas when confined to clearly established driveways leading to residences.
Driveways, where required by ordinance, shall be of a hard surface, otherwise
there shall be gravel, or such driveways shall be treated so as to control dust
which constitutes a nuisance. Except for driveway parking above permitted, the
area between the setback line of the dwelling and the street right-of-way line

Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit the temporary parking of
boats, motor homes, camper trailers or other recreational vehicles in driveways
for a continuous period not to exceed forty-eight hours for purposes of

prescribed on the issued traffic ticket. Such payment shall be deemed a plea of
guilty, waiver of court appearance and acknowledgement of conviction of the
alleged offense and may be accepted in full satisfaction of the prescribed
penalty for such alleged violation. Payment of the prescribed fine need not be
accepted when laws prescribe that a certain number of such offenses shall

the owner;
(3)   When any watercraft has been used in or connected with the commission of
a felony;
(4)   When any watercraft has been damaged or wrecked so as to be inoperable or

against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
606.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
 
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
 
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
 
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
 
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
 
   606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.

   606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   606.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization may be prosecuted for
an offense committed by such organization if he or she acts with the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense and any of the following
applies:
(1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf he or she engages in
conduct constituting the offense or causes another to engage in such conduct or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has direct
responsibility;
(2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   606.10   FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official’s official function.
      (4)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the payment of
unemployment compensation; Ohio works first; prevention, retention and

governmental agency of a license, permit, authorization, certificate,

      (6)   The statement is sworn or affirmed before a notary public or
another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

another to extend credit to or employ the offender, or to confer any degree,
diploma, certificate of attainment, award of excellence or honor on the
offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to that person’s detriment.
      (9)   The statement is made with purpose to commit or facilitate the
commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection
with any action, proceeding or other matter within its jurisdiction, either
orally or in a written document, including, but not limited to, an application,
petition, complaint or other pleading, or an inventory, account or report.
      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a
court of record.
      (13)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the
oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (c)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the
offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but
only that one or the other was false.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a)(1) to (8) or
(10) to (13) hereof is guilty of falsification, a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (a)(9) hereof is guilty of
falsification in a theft offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the
value of the property or services stolen is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
more, falsification in a theft offense is a felony and shall be prosecuted
under appropriate State law. 
   (e)   A person who violates this section is liable in a civil action to any

section.

(1)   The pending prosecution involved is for a violation of Section
642.02,

deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the

obtained.  For purposes of this subsection (c), “advanced practice registered
nurse” does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.

be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions.  Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered

R.C. 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege

relay service call.

violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05 or to victims of felonious sexual
penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12.  As used in this
subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

defendant in  a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an  attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the  court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
or her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or

or her testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with
great caution.

alleged act of discrimination.
   (b)   After the filing of any complaint, the Chairperson of the Board shall
designate a subcommittee of one or more of the members to make a prompt
investigation in connection therewith. If such member or members determine,
after such investigation, that there is probable cause for believing that the

with having engaged or engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice,
hereinafter referred to as the respondent, to answer the charges of such
complaint at a hearing before the Board, at a time and place to be specified in
such notice. The place of any such hearing shall be the office of the Board or
such other place as may be designated by it. The case in support of the
complaint shall be presented before the Board by the Law Director or an
assistant. The endeavors at conciliation shall not be received in evidence. The
respondent may file a written verified answer to the complaint and appear at
such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, and submit
testimony. At the discretion of the Board, the complainant may be allowed to
intervene and present testimony in person or by counsel. The Board or the
complainant may, reasonably and fairly amend any complaint, and the respondent
shall have like power to amend his or her answer. The Board shall not be bound
by the strict rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity. The
testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and recorded. If, upon all
the evidence at the hearing, the Board finds that a respondent has engaged in
any unlawful discriminatory practice, the Board shall state its findings of
fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order
requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory
practice and to take such affirmative action as may be indicated to effectuate
the provisions of this chapter. If, upon all the evidence, the Board finds that
a respondent has not engaged in any such unlawful discriminatory practice, the
Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served
on the complainant an order dismissing the complaint as to such respondent. A
copy of its order shall be delivered, in all cases, to the Clerk of Council.
The Board shall establish rules of practice to govern, expedite and effectuate
the procedure set forth in this section and its own actions hereunder. Any
complaint filed pursuant to this section must be so filed within sixty days
after the alleged act of discrimination.
(Ord. 84-40.  Passed 6-18-84.)
   628.07  INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER; ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   This chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of
the purposes thereof. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to
repeal any of the provisions of the Civil Rights Law or any other law of the
State relating to discrimination because of race, creed, color or national
origin. The procedure herein provided shall, while pending, be exclusive, and
the final determination therein shall exclude any other action, civil or
criminal, based on the same grievance of the individual concerned. If such
individual institutes any action based on such grievance without resorting to
the procedure provided in this chapter, he or she may not subsequently resort
to the procedure herein.
   (b)   If the Fair Housing Board determines that a violation has occurred,
and if the order of the Board issued pursuant thereto has not been complied
with, the Board, the complainant or any other person may:
(1)   Apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of the order;
and/or
(2)   File a criminal charge in the Municipal Court.
   In any such action, civil or criminal, the finding of the Board that the
respondent has violated any of the provisions of this chapter shall be prima-
facie proof of such violation and, in the absence of abuse of discretion, shall
be conclusive proof of such violation.

employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in

aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section

offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to its
former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable cost
of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and
quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
 642.24(f)(3).

person;
(5)   Creating a condition which is physically offensive to persons or which
presents a risk of physical harm to persons or property by any act which serves

material or performance involved in the violation, does not relieve the
offender of criminal liability for the violation, even though prosecution may
be stayed pending the judicial determination.

   698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that the
person will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by
a pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that the person will commit another offense. It is prima-facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
(1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as defined in
Section
606.01(h), and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense of violence;
(2)   Having been convicted of one or more sex offenses, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or more
of those sex offenses, the person commits a subsequent sex offense;
(3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in

   (ORC 2935.36)
   698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.

         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court

that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety

         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   In determining whether to impose imprisonment or a fine, or both, for
misdemeanor, and in determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and
method of payment of a fine for a misdemeanor, the court shall consider the
risk that the offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting
the public from the risk, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the
history, character and condition of the offender and the offender's need for
correctional or rehabilitative treatment, any statement made by the victim
under Ohio R.C. 2930.12 to 2930.17, if the offense is a misdemeanor specified
in Ohio R.C. 2930.01(A), and the ability and resources of the offender and the
nature of the burden that payment of a fine will impose on the offender.
 
   (b)   The following do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered in favor of imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor:
(1)   The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender;
(2)   Regardless of whether or not the offender knew the age of the victim, the
victim of the offense was sixty-five years of age or older or permanently and
totally disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.
(3)   The offense is a violation of Section
636.17 or Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a violation of Section
636.02 or Ohio R.C. 2903.13 involving a person who was a family or household
member at the time of the violation, the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children.
   If the offense is a violation of Section
636.17 or Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a violation of Section
636.02 or Ohio R.C. 2903.13 involving a person who was a family or household
member at the time of the violation and the court decides to impose a term of
imprisonment upon the offender, the factor listed in paragraph (b)(3) hereof
shall be considered in favor of imposing a longer term of imprisonment on the
offender.
   (c)   The criteria listed in Ohio R.C. 2929.12(C) and (E), that mitigate the
seriousness of the offense and that indicate that the offender is unlikely to
commit future crimes, do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered against imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (d)   The criteria listed in subsection (b) hereof and referred to in
subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed to limit the matters that may be
considered in determining whether to impose imprisonment for misdemeanor.
 
   (e)   The court shall not impose a fine in addition to imprisonment for
misdemeanor, unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or
the correction of the offender, or the offense has proximately resulted in
physical harm to the person or property of another, or the offense was
committed for hire or for purpose of gain.
 
   (f)   The court shall not impose a fine or fines that, in the aggregate and
to the extent not suspended by the court, exceed the amount that the offender
is or will be able to pay by the method and within the time allowed without
undue hardship to the offender or the offender's dependents, or will prevent
the offender from making restitution or reparation to the victim of the
offender's offense.
 
   (g)   At the time of sentencing or as soon as possible after sentencing, the
court shall notify the victim of the offense of the victim's right to file an
application for an award of reparations pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2743.51 through
2743.72.
 
   (h)   As used in this section, "repeat offender" and "dangerous offender"

   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this section.
 
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be
pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section defining the
offense.
 
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
 606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.  (ORC 2929.31)
   698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.

eighteen months.
 
   (d)   A sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor violation of
Section
 434.01 or Section 436.07(a), (c), (d) or (e) of the Traffic Code shall be
served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of
Ohio R.C. 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio
R.C. 2903.04, involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender, and
that is served in a State correctional institution when the trial court
specifies that it is to be served consecutively.
   When consecutive sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for
one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this section, the term
to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the
offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term
imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
   698.06  MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.
   (a)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when imprisonment is
imposed for a misdemeanor, the court may do any of the following:
(1)   Suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2951.02;
(2)   Suspend the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02 upon any terms that
the court considers appropriate;
(3)   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in intermittent
confinement, overnight, or on weekends, or both, or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family; or
(4)   Require the offender to serve a portion of the offender's sentence, which
may be served in intermittent confinement, and suspend the balance of the
sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02 upon any terms that the court considers
appropriate or suspend the balance of the sentence and place the offender on
probation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02.
   (b)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when a term of
imprisonment is imposed for a violation of Section
636.17(a) or (c) involving a protection order issued or consent agreement
approved pursuant to Section
636.17(b) or Ohio R.C. 3113.31, and when the court has reason to believe, based
on an evaluation performed pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2919.271 or on the advice of a
chemical dependency professional, that the offender is a drug dependent person,
is in danger of becoming a drug dependent person, is an alcoholic, or is
suffering from acute  alcohol intoxication, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.33,
the court may require the offender to serve a portion of the offender's
sentence and suspend the balance of the sentence and place the offender on
probation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02, with one of the conditions of
probation being that the offender enter into an appropriate treatment program
or facility and comply with the treatment prescribed at the program or
facility.  The court shall order a person to enter a particular program or
facility under this subsection only if the court has received evidence that the
program or facility has space available and that the treatment provided by the
program or facility is appropriate.  For purposes of this subsection, an
appropriate treatment program or facility includes a program licensed by the
Ohio Director of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3793.11, a program certified by the Ohio Director of Alcohol and Drug Addiction
Services pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.06, a public or private hospital, the
Veterans Administration or other agencies of the Federal Government, or private
care or treatment rendered by a physician or a psychologist licensed in the
State, a licensed independent social worker, a licensed professional clinical
counselor or a certified chemical dependency counselor.  For purposes of this
subsection, the fact that an offender is a repeat offender, as defined in
Section
698.01, shall not conclusively bar the offender from conditional probation
under this subsection if the previous offenses for which the offender was
imprisoned involved violations of Section
636.17(a) or (c) involving a protection order issued or consent agreement
approved pursuant to Section
636.17(b) or Ohio R.C. 3113.31, or equivalent violations of substantially
equivalent municipal ordinances, or violations of either of those sections had
they been in effect at the time of the violations.
   (c)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when a fine is imposed
for a misdemeanor, the court may do either of the following:
(1)   Suspend all or any portion of the fine, upon any conditions that the
court imposes in the interests of justice and the correction and rehabilitation
of the offender; or
(2)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the fine in installments, or by
any other method and in any time and on any terms that the court considers
just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed two
years.
   (ORC 2929.51)
   698.07  SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as may otherwise be provided in the Ohio Revised Code, whenever an
offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of
this General Offenses Code that is substantially similar to a provision of the
Ohio Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to suspend or revoke a
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a violation of
that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties it is authorized by
law to impose upon the offender, may suspend the offender's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit for the period of time the court
determines appropriate, or may revoke the license or permit, but in no case
shall the period of suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of
this General Offenses Code exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or
required to be imposed for the violation of the provision of the Ohio Revised
Code to which the provision of this General Offenses Code is substantially
similar.  (ORC 4507.1611)

   No person shall install, erect, insert, attach, build, create or otherwise
use any alarm system which, by electronic, radio, automatic or mechanical means
on the occurrence of a given event, circumstance or condition, transmits a
signal or voice communication for reception by either the City Fire Division or
the City Police Division, unless the requirements set forth in this chapter
have been complied with.
(Ord. 75-75.  Passed 9-22-75.)
   804.02  INSTALLATION; PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; INSTALLATION OF
TELEPHONE LINE OR RADIO; EXISTING INSTALLATIONS.
   (a)   No person shall install an alarm system in any building, residence,
warehouse, showroom, factory, commercial building or other location in the
City, which system causes a signal or voice communication to be transmitted to
the Fire Division or the Police Division, without first obtaining a permit
therefor. Application for such a permit shall be made to the Mayor or his
authorized representative.
   (b)   It shall be a condition of the approval of the application that the
applicant install, at his own expense, at a location determined by either the
Police Division or the Fire Division, either a telephone line or radio, or such
other instrument as may be otherwise required to receive the signal or voice
communication message transmitted by the alarm unit. All installation,
operating, maintenance and continuing costs of the receiving instrument must be
borne by the applicant.
   (c)   Any residence or lawful business located within the City may, upon
compliance with this chapter, be equipped with an emergency alarm for the
purpose of detecting and signaling the presence of a fire or unauthorized
intrusion. Existing installations shall be subject to the requirements of this

to the Police Division to receive emergency alarms, the Mayor or his authorized
representative may issue a permit for such connection.
 
   (b)   Connection to the police alarm panel, as provided for in subsection
(a) hereof, shall be contingent upon the applicant having obtained permission
from the company which maintains the alarm panel in the Police Station to make
such connection. Permission shall not be denied if equipment is compatible, if
charges are paid to the company and if such installation is inspected and
approved by the Chief of Police or his authorized representative.
 
   (c)   The City will, within its capabilities, endeavor to accommodate every
reasonable application for connection to the police alarm panel, as provided
for in subsection (b) hereof. (Ord. 75-75.  Passed 9-22-75.)
   804.04  STANDARDS FOR EQUIPMENT; SUPPLIERS; VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   All equipment used in installations for which a permit is required
shall meet the applicable standards of Underwriters' Laboratories and/or the
the National Fire Protection Association and/or other recognized industry
standards. Applicants may be required to submit evidence of the reliability and
suitability of the equipment to be installed.
 
   (b)   The sensory mechanism used in connection with such devices must be
adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or intrusion, so that the
devices will not be actuated by impulses due to transient pressure change in
water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or
vibrating of doors or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation or
other forces unrelated to genuine alarms.
   (c)   All components comprising such device must be maintained by the owner
or lessee in good repair to assure reliability of operation.
 
   (d)   Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases to a person an
automatic protection device which is installed on such person's premises in the
City shall furnish that person with instructions as to the way the device
operates, along with maintenance instructions.
 
   (e)   Each alarm equipment supplier shall also furnish the Chief of Police
with a copy of the instructions as to the way the device operates. If the Chief
of Police finds such to be incomplete, unclear or otherwise inadequate, he may
require the alarm equipment supplier to have the same revised to meet his
approval and then promptly have copies distributed to persons for whom
installations of such devices are made.
 
   (f)   Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases to a person an
automatic protection device which is installed on such person's premises in the
City and for which a permit is required, must provide for receiving calls for
service, directly or through an agent, on a twenty-four hour basis, seven days
a week, and shall respond to such calls within eight hours of the time they are
received.
 
   (g)   At the time of installation, each alarm equipment supplier shall
furnish to the person for whom an automatic protection device has been
installed, written information as to how service can be obtained at any time,
including the telephone number to call for service, and such person shall be
responsible for having the device repaired as quickly as possible after he
learns, either from his own sources or from notification by the Chief of
Police, that the device is not working properly.
 
   (h)   The Chief of Police or any officer designated by him shall have the
authority, at reasonable times and upon oral notice, to enter upon any premises
within the City, to inspect the installation and operation of an automatic
protection device or signalling device, the purpose of which is to report an
emergency to the Police Station.
 
   (i)   All equipment, the use or installation of which is subject to this
chapter, shall be maintained in good operating condition. The Chief of Police
may require that repairs be made whenever he has determined that such repairs
are necessary to assure proper operation.
 
   (j)   For a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, for failure
to properly maintain an installation or when the number of false alarms for any
installation equals ten in a twelve-month period, the Chief of Police may serve
written notice upon a permit holder of intent to revoke his permit. Such notice
shall be given not less than seven days prior to revocation. Such notice shall
state the right of the permit holder to appeal to the Mayor. If an appeal is
filed in writing, the Mayor shall hold a hearing on the matter and shall render
a decision on the basis of the facts presented. The Mayor's decision shall be
final. In the event no appeal is filed, the Chief of Police shall transmit all
pertinent information to the Mayor who shall cancel the permit. The Chief of
Police shall take whatever steps are necessary to disconnect the alarm.
(Ord. 75-75.  Passed 9-22-75.)   
   (k)   Electronic or voice alarm systems and equipment which transmit alarm
signals through telephone and radio lines to the Vermilion Police Division
shall be maintained so as not to cause false alarms.  Users whose alarm systems
cause more than two false alarms within a calendar year, said calendar year
being defined as the period from January 1 through December 31, shall be
assessed a false alarm fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each such
false alarm thereafter.  The two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) fee is intended
to help defray the costs incurred by the Police Division in responding to such
false alarms.
(Ord. 94-41.  Passed 6-20-94.)
   804.05  NONINTERFERENCE WITH POLICE AND FIRE DIVISIONS.
   The receiving unit shall be permitted to remain for only so long as it does
not interfere with the normal daily operation of the Police and Fire
Divisions.  Upon the determination by the Director of Public Safety that such
alarm system is not an aid to preventing crime, the apprehension of criminals
or fighting fires or that it is disrupting or interfering with the daily

   870.01  DEFINITIONS.
   Certain terms used herein are defined for the purposes of this chapter as
follows:
   (a)   "Taxicab" means a vehicle driven by mechanical power operated for the 
purpose of transporting passengers for hire, without regard to any fixed route
or schedule, from the stand of the operator of such taxicab, or from any point
in the City to any other point within or without the City, at the instance and
volition of the passenger hiring such vehicle at any particular time.
     (b)   "Operate for hire" embraces the terms "plying for hire" and
"carrying passengers for hire" and means engaging in a transportation service
by any person, directly or through any agent, lessee, representative, officer
or employee, in the business of transporting persons, or providing or

City. The term includes soliciting public patronage upon the streets and
highways of this City; demanding, accepting or receiving any compensation,
remuneration, reward, gift, donation, gratuity, tip or other consideration, for
transporting any person over the public highways of this City, whether the
amount received is equal to, greater then or  less than the rates prescribed by
this chapter; holding out of oneself to the general public as prepared to
transport any person without charge or for such fee as the person transported
may voluntarily contribute; and the employment of any other scheme, device or
method to circumvent or evade the provisions of this chapter.
      (Ord. 639.  Passed 3-6-61.)
 
   870.02  ENFORCEMENT; TRANSFER OF LICENSES.
   The issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity, the
licensing and inspection of taxicabs, the examination of applicants for permits
to drive taxicabs, the issuing of permits to drivers, as hereinafter provided,
and the enforcing of the provisions of this chapter, shall be under the control
of the Mayor.
   If the taxicab shall be disabled or disqualified for service or sold, the
Mayor may, at his discretion, permit the use of a license granted for a taxicab
to be transferred and used for another, provided the taxicab complies with the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 639.  Passed 3-6-61.)
   870.03  CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY REQUIRED; LICENSE
FEE.
   No person or other legal entity shall operate or permit a taxicab owned or
controlled by him or it to be operated as a vehicle for hire upon the streets
of the City without having first obtained a certificate of public convenience
and necessity from the Mayor.
   No certificate shall be issued or continued in operation unless the holder
thereof has paid an annual license fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) each calendar
year or any portion thereof for each vehicle operated under a certificate of
public convenience and necessity. No vehicle shall be licensed as a taxicab
unless it is owned and operated by the applicant. An application for a license
shall be made by the owner upon blank forms to be furnished by the Mayor. Such
applications shall contain the full name and address of the owner, the make,
model and year of the vehicle, the length of time the vehicle has been in use,
the number of persons it is capable of carrying and the motor power thereof.
   870.04   APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE.
   An application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall
be filed with the Mayor upon forms provided by the City. Such application shall
be verified under oath and shall furnish the following information:
   (a)   The name and address of the applicant.
   (b)   The financial status of the applicant, including the amounts of all
unpaid judgments against the applicant and the nature of the transaction or
acts giving rise to such judgments.
   (c)   The experience of the applicant in the transportation of passengers.
   (d)   Any facts which the applicant believes tend to prove that public
convenience and necessity require the granting of a certificate.
   (e)   The number of vehicles to be operated or controlled by the
application, and the location of proposed depots and terminals.
   (f)   The color scheme or insignia to be used to designate the vehicle of
the applicant.

      (Ord. 639. Passed 3-6-61.)
   870.05   PUBLIC HEARING.
   Upon the filing of an application, the Mayor shall fix a time and place for
a public hearing thereon. Notice of such hearing shall be given to the
applicant and to all persons to whom certificates of public convenience and
necessity have been theretofore issued. Due notice shall also be given the
general public by posting a notice of such hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. Any interested person may file with the Mayor a
memorandum in support of or opposition to the issuance of a certificate.
(Ord. 639.  Passed 3-6-61.)
   870.06  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE.
   If the Mayor finds that further taxicab service in the City is required by
the public convenience and necessity and that the applicant is fit, willing and
able to perform such public transportation and to conform to the provisions of
this chapter and the rules promulgated by the Mayor, then the Mayor shall issue
a certificate stating the name and address of the applicant, the number of
vehicles authorized under such certificate and the date of issuance; otherwise,
the application shall be denied.
   In making the above findings, the Mayor shall take into consideration the
number of taxicabs already in operation, whether existing transportation is
adequate to meet the public need, the probable effect of increased service on
local traffic conditions, and the character, experience and responsibility of
the applicant.
   Owners of the existing licenses shall be entitled to issuance of
certificates of public convenience and necessity upon application therefor as
set forth in Section
870.04 . Certificates of public convenience and necessity may be assigned and
transferred upon application to and approval of the Mayor.
(Ord. 639. Passed 3-6-61.)
   870.07   INSPECTION BEFORE LICENSING VEHICLES.
   When licenses or renewals of existing licenses are issued for any taxicabs
which may have been disabled, disqualified, sold or otherwise unavailable at
the time of the granting of such licenses, no such vehicle which may thereafter
be acquired for use in connection with any such licenses shall be placed in
operation until it has been thoroughly and carefully inspected and examined and
found to be in a thoroughly safe condition for the transportation of
passengers, clean, fit, of good appearance and well painted and varnished.
   The Mayor shall refuse to permit the operation of any such vehicle or, if
already placed in operation, revoke or suspend the operation of any vehicle
found by him to be unfit or unsuited for public patronage. The Mayor is
authorized and empowered to establish reasonable rules and regulations for the
inspection of taxicabs and their appurtenances, construction and condition or
fitness.
(Ord. 639.  Passed 3-6-61.)
   870.08  LIABILITY INSURANCE.

approved by the Mayor and the Director of Law, indemnifying the applicant in
the sum of at least five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for injury to one
person, one million dollars ($1,000,000) for injury to more than one person and
one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) property damage in any one accident
through the operation of the taxicab of the applicant. The policy shall further
contain a clause obligating the surety company to give ten days' written notice
to the Mayor before cancellation of the policy; the license to expire upon the
lapse or termination of the policy of insurance.
   Such policy of insurance shall contain a provision for a continuing
liability thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any recovery
thereon. If at any time in the judgment of the Mayor such policy is not
sufficient for any cause, the Mayor may require the owner of such taxicab to
replace such policy with another approved by the Mayor and the Director of Law.
   870.09  LICENSE CARD.
   If, upon inspection, a taxicab is found to be of lawful construction and in
proper condition in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the
rules and regulations established hereunder, then upon the payment of the
license fee set forth in Section
870.03 , the same shall be licensed by delivering to the owner a card of such
size and form as may be prescribed by the Mayor. The card shall contain the
official license number of the taxicab, together with the date of inspection of
the same and a statement to the effect that in case of any complaints, the
Mayor shall be notified, giving the license number of the taxicab. Such card
shall be signed by the Mayor and shall contain blank spaces upon which an entry
shall be made of the date of every inspection of the vehicle by the inspector.

complaint of any citizen, as often as may be necessary.

of Police, revoke or suspend any license granted under this chapter if the

in good condition and appearance, clean and safe. Licenses revoked for the
reason that the vehicle has been used for immoral or illegal business or
purposes shall not be issued again, and licenses revoked because of the
condition and appearance of the vehicle shall not be reissued until the vehicle

882.13 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section

the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

earned and/or received by each employee in the City.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
882.04 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section

withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter

Payment(s) under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax

payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by

agents, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.

file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or

of an employer, or other payer.

to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of

         (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not

section, an employer is not required to withhold the City income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
882.05.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City
for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Chapter 882.03, the employer shall
withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages for a
taxable year and remit that tax only to the City, regardless of the number of
days which the employee worked outside the corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
882.05.

other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
      (2)     Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the City income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any

the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation
form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other

An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.

section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter/ordinance,
each individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall

      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City's income tax return.
         (b)     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's the City income tax return.  If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City income tax return is
due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
the City's income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g)) within the
City.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City.  The affidavit shall also include
the following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign he
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b), the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
882.05 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.

filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the

withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:

Internal Revenue Code.
       (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown. 
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated the
City income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated the City
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
882.03, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the City income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1) to the
extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment
has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Chapter 882.06, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
882.06, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
882.06, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
882.06 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.07  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality.  Subject to division
(C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed 1%. 
   (B)     The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
   (D)     Intentionally left blank.  (Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.08  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
882.06 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
882.19 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
       (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
882.06 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year. 
(Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.09  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.10  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
882.19.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
882.22.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
882.19 (A)(4). 
(Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.11  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City.  If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate.  However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.12  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
882.13 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
882.13 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
882.10.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended the City return showing income subject to the
City income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars. 
(Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.13  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
882.22. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
882.10.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
882.10, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
882.10.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the City income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.14  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 2018-19.  Passed 4-2-18.)
   882.15  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City

   886.01  DEFINITIONS.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction and are the meaning of the words defined:
   (a)   "Finance Director" means the Finance Director of the City of Vermilion
or his or her appointed designee.
   (b)   "Hotel/motel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more
rooms are used for the accommodations of such guests, whether such rooms are in
one or several structures.
   (c)   Transient accommodation means every establishment kept, used,
maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered to guests in which four (4) or less rooms are used
for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one (1) or
several structures.
   (d)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession, of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof in any hotel/motel
or transient accommodation for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use
or possession or right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting
rooms as office space, banquet or private dining rooms or exhibit, sample or
display space shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this
definition unless the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the

dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.
   (e)   "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel/motel or

employee.  The managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes
of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her
principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the

   (f)   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,

whatsoever.
   (h)   "Transient guest" means persons occupying a room or rooms for sleeping
accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
      (Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.02  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City of Vermilion for the use in the General Fund of the City an excise tax
is hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel/motel or transient
accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
 
   (b)   The tax is three percent (3%) on all rents paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the
transient guest to the City of Vermilion, which is extinguished only by payment
to the operator as trustee for the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax
to the operator at the time the lodging is furnished regardless of the time
when the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate
share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be
due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space. The operator shall
collect from the transient guest the full and exact amount of the tax payable
on each taxable lodging. The operator shall deposit all funds collected under
this section into a separate account as trustee for the City of Vermilion
separate from all other funds of the operator.
 
   (c)   For the administration of this Chapter, and to prevent evasion of the
tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by operators to transient guests
is subject to the tax until the contrary is established. 
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.03   EXEMPTIONS.

Constitution or laws of the State of Ohio or the United States; or
      (2)     Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions. 
   (b)   No exemption claimed under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) hereof shall be
granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and
under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Finance Director.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.04  FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS PROHIBITED.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the operator false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax. 
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.05  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for said occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator.  The tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
 
   (b)   No operator of a hotel/motel or transient accommodation shall
advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax
or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it
will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded
except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.06   REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter or within thirty

motel renting lodging to transient guests shall register said hotel/motel with
the Finance Director and obtain a Transient Accommodation license from the
Vermilion Building Department per Chapter
873 of the Vermilion Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.07  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)   Each operator shall on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each quarter of the calendar year upon approval of the Finance
Director, make a return to the Finance Director on forms provided by him or
her, of total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for
the transient occupancies.  All claims for exemption from tax filed by
occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the
report
 
   (b)   At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected
shall be remitted to the Finance Director. The Finance Director may establish
shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it
necessary to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further
information in the return if such information is pertinent to the collection of
the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason.
 
   (c)   All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be
held in trust for the account of the City of Vermilion until payment thereof is
made to the Finance Director. All returns and payments submitted to each
operator shall be treated as confidential by the Finance Director and shall not

the County of Erie or Lorain or to comply with requirements of Ohio R.C.
149.43. A statement of account shall be furnished annually to all operators

chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Fraud. If the Finance Director determines that the non-payment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to
the penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent, until paid. 
   (d)     Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. All penalties and
interest provided under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed and fully
charged during the pendency of any hearing provided for in Section
886.10 of this chapter or during the pendency of any appeal to Vermilion City
Council provided for in Section
886.11 of this chapter.
   (e)   Abatement of Interest and Penalty. In cases where a return has been
filed in good faith and an assessment has been paid within the time prescribed
by the Finance Director, the Finance Director may abate any charges of penalty
or interest, or both. 
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.09  RECORDS; INSPECTION; DESTRUCTION.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction,
if exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be
opened during business hours to the inspection of the Finance Director and
shall be preserved for a period of three years, unless the Finance Director, in
writing, consents to their destruction within that period or by any others
requesting that such records be kept for a longer period.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.10   FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX, DETERMINATION OF TAX BY FINANCE
DIRECTOR.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Finance Director shall have the
right of entry into a hotel/motel to inspect all records held by the hotel/
motel operator. As soon as the Finance Director shall procure such facts and
information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of
any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has filed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Finance
Director shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax,
interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination
is made, the Finance Director shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by
serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place
of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of
such notice make application in writing to the Finance Director for a hearing
on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined
by the Finance Director shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable. If such application is made, the Finance Director shall give not
less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the
Finance Director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an
appeal is taken as provided in Section
886.11.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.11   APPEALS.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Finance Director with respect
to the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to Vermilion
City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the Clerk of Vermilion City
Council and the Finance Director within fifteen days of the serving or mailing
of the determination of tax due. The Vermilion City Council shall fix a time
and place for hearing such appeal and shall give notice in writing to such
operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the
Vermilion City Council shall be served upon the appellant in the manner
prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due
shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.12  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall
be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing such a debt
to the City under the provisions of this chapter which debt has become
delinquent, shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City of
Vermilion by and through the City of Vermilion prosecutor for the recovery of
such amount.
(Ord. 2019-7.  Passed 2-25-19.)
   886.13   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City of Vermilion under this chapter, it may be refunded as
provided in subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing
therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the Finance Director within three years of the
date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Finance Director.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take a credit against taxes
collected and remitted for the amount overpaid, paid more than once or
erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a
manner prescribed by the Finance Director that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient guest, provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Finance Director, or
when the transient guest, having paid the tax to the  operator, establishes to
the satisfaction of the Finance Department that the transient guest has been
unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this chapter unless
the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.

   1020.01  CLEANING AND REPAIRING SIDEWALKS.
   (a)   This Council hereby declares that any sidewalk existing within the
public way that has fallen into a state of deterioration or disrepair so as to
become dangerous constitutes a public nuisance and likewise any obstruction
upon the public way shall constitute a nuisance.  This Council hereby delegates
upon the Chief Building Inspector the duty and obligation to determine when a
sidewalk or any portion thereof shall become so deteriorated or obstructed as
to constitute a public nuisance requiring the implementation of this section.
   (b)   Corrective action for repair of sidewalks will be necessary based on
the following criteria:
      (1)   3/4" or more vertical difference in any part of walk.
      (2)   ½" or wider gap between pieces or slabs.  Hardened surface material
for repairing anything wider.  Soil and stone not acceptable.
      (3)   Unstable or moving sections or pieces of walk.
      (4)   Improperly sloped segments.  Maximum slopes permitted: Cross slope
1:48, a slope in the direction of travel is 1:20, ramps as defined by ADA
regulations shall not exceed 1:12.
      (5)   Standing water, mud, moss, etc., on a walk where it poses a slip
hazard as determined by the Building Inspector.
      (6)   Insufficient width of sidewalks (3' minimum and not less than
contiguous walk widths).
   (c)   Methods of Correction.
      (1)   When leveling large sections of concrete walk - proper fill is
required providing lasting stability.  Repaired areas must meet the minimum
standards of the City and shall not contain deficiencies listed above.
      (2)   Raising large sections of concrete walk - proper fill is required
to provide lasting stability.  Repaired areas must meet the minimum standards
of the City and shall not contain deficiencies listed above.
      (3)   Remove and pour new sections of concrete - as per Codified
Ordinances.  All sidewalks shall be minimum 4" thick concrete and shall have a
textured slip resistant finish.
      (4)   Grind edge of walk - exposure of reinforcing materials during the
grinding  process requires complete replacement of damaged area.  Grinding area
shall not exceed the maximum slope permitted by Code.
      (5)   Replace or relay sections of sandstone walk - the smallest piece
shall be no smaller than thirty-two square inches, except where approved by the
Building Inspector.  The relayed sidewalks must meet the corrective action
criteria as established above.
   (d)   Sandstone pieces and slabs must be installed on a property compacted
base to provide lasting stability and shall not contain deficiencies as listed
above.  A slab is considered a single piece of 4' x 3' minimum size.

abatement of such nuisance.
(Ord. 02-30.  Passed 6-3-02.)

of the County Auditor, then the Chief Building Inspector shall cause a
certified letter to be sent to such landowner.  If repairs are not completed
thirty (30) days after mail receipt of certified letter, the Building Inspector
shall cause the sidewalk or portion thereof to be repaired at a rate not less
than forty-five dollars ($45.00) per square foot.  Upon completion of the work
an invoice will be sent to the property owner.  If the invoice isn’t paid
within thirty (30) days the charges will be certified to the taxes for the
parcel.  (Ord. 2008-42.  Passed 7-14-08.)

   (a)   This deposit shall be used for the verification of finished ground
grades to confirm if they conform to the approved grading plan. If necessary,
the deposit can be used to grade the site in accordance with approved grading
plans. Costs for inspection shall be calculated at a rate of not to exceed
fifty dollars ($50.00) per hour.
   (b)   The developer or builder shall grade in order to establish street,
blocks and lot grades in proper relation to each other, as follows:
(1)   Streets. Grading of streets shall extend the full width of the right of
way. Tree lawns shall be graded at a gradient and prescribed in the City
standard details upward from the curb to the right-of-way line whenever
possible.
(2)   Blocks. Grading shall be designed to divert water from structures, to
prevent standing water and soil saturation detrimental to structures and the
use of lots, and to preserve desirable site features and grades for safe and
convenient access to and around structures.
(3)   Lots. The floor elevation of each structure shall be established in
proper relation to surrounding grades, driveways and streets. There shall be a
minimum grade of five percent around each structure so that water drains to
lower areas. Drainage swales shall have a minimum grade of 0.5 percent. Each
lot shall have access to a rear yard inlet basin. Lot grading shall be designed
so that surface water will drain into the driveway, a drainage structure on the
lot, a street gutter and storm sewer or a natural drainage way. Minimum and
maximum grades of driveways shall be 0.5 percent and 10.0 percent,
respectively. Grade breaks must be no greater than fifteen percent. Grading
shall be adjusted so there will be no abrupt grades in front yards and along
side lot lines. Earth terraces shall have a maximum side slope ratio of 2.5:1.
(4)   Top Soil. If grading results in the stripping of top soil, such soil
shall not be removed from any subdivision or used as fill, but shall be saved
and uniformly spread over the lots as grading is finished.
   (Ord. 99-15.  Passed 5-3-99.)
   1030.04  GRADING TO ADJOINING LOT, SIDEWALK OR STREET.
   (a)   Owner's Duty to Grade to Adjoining Lot Grade. When a lot or section of
ground is graded, it shall be incumbent upon the owner of such lot to provide
that the lot be graded to the approved grade of the lots adjoining such lot on
both sides and to the lot in the rear of such lot.
   (b)   Finished Grade at Sidewalk, Curb or Street. When a lot or plat of
ground is graded, it shall be graded so as to meet the approved grade.
 
   (c)   Fill Material.  Fill material used on site shall not contain
deleterious or objectionable materials, refuse or other fill that is
prohibited.
(Ord. 99-15.  Passed 5-3-99.)
   1030.05   RETAINING WALLS.
   When it is found necessary to grade a lot to a higher or lower finished
grade than the natural grade or adjoining property on the sides and to the rear
of such lot, it shall be incumbent upon the owner of such lot to get permission
from the City Engineer to change to a higher or lower finished grade.  It shall
further be incumbent upon the owner of the lot to provide suitable retaining
walls or other approved protection on his or her property to protect adjacent
property and structures from the draining of surface waters or damage, and
further, to protect the adjacent property and structures from caving of earth
and to assist in the maintaining of the existing natural grade of such
property.  An approval from the City Engineer is required prior to construction
of any new retaining wall higher than three feet above the lowest grade or
repairs to any existing retaining wall higher than three feet above the lowest
grade. Plans, prepared and stamped by a registered design professional, shall
be submitted for review.  The fee for such review and permit issuance shall be
three hundred dollars ($300.00).
(Ord. 2018-59.  Passed 10-22-18.)
   1030.06   HARD-SURFACED AREAS DRAINAGE.
   Whenever the surfaces of a lot or plat is excavated, filled, graded or hard-
surfaced, positive drainage in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
shall be provided so that a nuisance will not be created.  Catch basins
properly connected to storm sewers or other approved provisions, such as
underdrains, shall be made where water may pocket, to preclude the accumulation
of surface water.  Surface water shall not be drained onto adjacent properties
not in the same ownership without written permission, in the form of an
easement, from the owner of the adjacent property, and existing natural ground
drainage of the ground area surrounding the lot or plat excavated, filled or
graded shall not be impeded.  If required by the Engineer, the improvement of
the land shall include stormwater detention. 
(Ord. 2011-80.  Passed 11-21-11.)
   1030.07  WATER ACCUMULATION.
   No condition shall be created nor any existing condition maintained whereby

   1042.05   USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted
stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage,
uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial process waters to any
sanitary sewer. The owner of a building served by a public sanitary sewer shall
be responsible for the maintenance, repair, replacement, and cleaning of the
private sanitary lateral located on the building owner's property. The building
owner shall not be responsible for any portion of the private sanitary lateral
located in the public right-of-way. If a private sanitary lateral becomes
damaged, separates from the sanitary sewers, or discharges into the storm water
system, the building owner, at the building owner's expense, shall repair or
replace that portion of the private sanitary lateral that is located on the
building owner's property and outside the public right-of-way. The repair or
replacement of a private sanitary lateral under this Section shall be completed
within ninety (90) days of the building owner receiving notice from the City
that the private sanitary lateral must be repaired or replaced. Any repairs to
or replacement of a private sanitary lateral shall be subject to inspection and
approval by the City to ensure compliance with federal and state law and the
City's Codified Ordinances. All owners of newly constructed buildings that
discharge into the public sanitary sewers shall, at the owner's expense,
install a clean-out in their sanitary lateral within or near the public right-
of-way. If an existing private sanitary lateral is replaced or repaired, the
building owner shall install a clean-out in the building's sanitary lateral
within or near the public right-of-way at the building owner's expense. The
installation of the clean-out shall be inspected and approved by the City to
ensure compliance with federal and state law and the City's Codified
Ordinances. Any existing roof drain connections to sanitary sewers shall be
connected into an available storm sewer or shall be disconnected above ground
in the manner approved by the City. The owners of all buildings situated within
the City are required at their expense to disconnect all existing roof drains
from sanitary sewers in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within
ninety days after the date of official notice to do so.
(Ord. 2018-40.  Passed 7-23-18.)
 
   (b)   Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm drain or
to a natural outlet approved by the City and other regulatory agencies.
Unpolluted industrial cooling water or process waters may be discharged on
approval by the City to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
 
   (c)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described waters or wastes to any public sewer or treatment works:
(1)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or explosive
liquid, solid or gas.
(2)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 6.0 or greater than 9.5 or
having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment and personnel of the wastewater works.
(3)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference with the proper
operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to, ashes,
bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar,
plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and
fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole
or ground by garbage grinders.
   (d)   The following described substances, materials, waters or waste shall
be limited in discharges to Municipal systems to concentrations ar quantities
which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process or
equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or will not
otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance. The
Director may set limitations lower than the limitations established in the
regulations herein if in his opinion such more severe limitations are necessary
to meet the above objectives. Deliberate dilution with unpolluted water to meet
the concentrations established in the regulations herein shall not be
acceptable. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the Director will
give consideration to such facts as the quantity of subject waste in relation
to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on
materials or characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged to the sanitary
sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the Director are as
follows:
(1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150° (65°C).
(2)   Wastewater containing more than fifty milligrams per liter of petroleum
oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, products of mineral oil origin, or
floatable oils, fat, wax or grease.
(3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders may be
connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions, restaurants,
hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage originates
from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the
premises or when served by caterers.
(4)   Any waters or wastes containing solids, liquids or gases in sufficient
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans
or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving
waters of the Wastewater Treatment Plant, including, but not limited to
cyanides, hexavalent chromium, copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel and phenols in the
wastes as discharged to the public sewer. The following concentrations shall
not be exceeded in industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers:
   total cyanide (CN), 0.5 milligrams per liter (mg/l)
   hexavalent chromium, 1.0 mg/l
   copper, 1.0 mg/l
   zinc, 1.0 mg/1
   cadmium, 0.2 mg/l
   nickel, 2.0 mg/l
   phenols, 0. 2 mg/l
   lead, 0.5 mg/l
   mercury, 0.01 mg/l
   silver, 0.2 mg/l
   These maximum concentrations may be changed as necessary by the Director or
State regulatory agencies based on new information concerning inhibitory 
substances or to protect treatment plant processes. Industrial dischargers
covered by Federal pretreatment requirements shall meet those limitations
specified under the effluent guidelines published under Sections 304 b) and 307
b) of the Federal Act or the above concentrations, whichever is more stringent.
Major contributing industries discharging incompatible pollutants into the
public sewers shall be regulated as provided in subsection (e) hereof.
(5)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Director or any local or State
regulatory agencies.
(6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as
may exceed limits in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
(7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute a slug as
defined in this chapter.
(8)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
(9)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes in
the public sewerage system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended solids
which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious
to structures and treatment processes.
   (e)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in subsections (c) and (d) hereof, and which in the
judgment of the Engineer, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater
facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, including violation of
applicable water quality standards, or which otherwise create a hazard to life
or constitute a public nuisance, the Engineer shall:
(1)   Reject the wastes;
(2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
(3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes under the provisions of the appropriate ordinances.
   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major contributing
industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment standards or best
practical control technology currently available for incompatible pollutants as
published in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 128 unless the City is
committed, in its NPDES permit, to remove a specified percentage of the
incompatible pollutant. In those instances the applicable pretreatment
standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels determined by the Engineer,
or his duly authorized representative, or State regulatory agencies.
   If the Engineer requires pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Engineer and State regulatory agencies and subject
to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (f)   For grease, oil and inorganic materials such as sand, grit, etc.,
interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Engineer, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease
in excessive amounts, as specified in subparagraph (d)(2) hereof, or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Engineer, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner
shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of
disposal which are subject to review by the Director. Any removal and hauling
of the collected materials not performed by the owners' personnel must be
performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (g)   Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (h)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater published by the American Public Health Association.
Sampling methods, location, times, durations and frequencies are to be
determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the Director.
 
   (i)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to possible payment therefor
by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment. Any industrial concern may
appeal to the City any determination made by the Engineer in the enforcement of
this chapter.
(Ord. 75-50. Passed 6-16-75.)
   1042.06   CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (a)   Within thirty days after passage of this section (Ordinance 75-50,
passed June 16, 1975), each person whose operation entails the discharge of
industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the Engineer a
written statement setting forth the nature of the operation contemplated or
presently carried on, the amount and source of water required for use, the
proposed point of discharge of such wastes into the wastewater collection
system of the City, the estimated amount to be so discharged and a fair
statement setting forth the expected bacterial, physical, chemical and other
known characteristics of such wastes. Within a reasonable time of receipt of
such statement, it shall be the duty of the City to make an order stating such
minimum restrictions as in the judgment of the Engineer may be necessary to
adequately guard against unlawful uses of the City wastewater system.
 
   (b)   When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would
create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the time schedule
imposed by subsection (a) hereof, a request for extension of time may be
presented for consideration of the Engineer. All requests for extension of time
shall be submitted in writing stating the reasons for such a request. Under no
circumstances shall the extension of time exceed thirty days after approval of
the extension by the Engineer.
 
   (c)   Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall
construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his wastes, including
sanitary wastewater.
   Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in a manner
acceptable to the Engineer. If measuring devices are to be permanently
installed they shall be of a type acceptable to the Engineer.
   Control manholes, access facilities and related equipment shall be installed
by the person discharging the waste at his expense, and shall be maintained by
him so as to be in a safe condition, accessible and in proper operating
condition at all times. Plans for the installation of such facilities shall be
approved by the Engineer prior to the beginning of construction.
   (d)   The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption of the person as shown in the records of
water meter readings maintained by the City except as provided in this section.
   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the City water system,
all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer, the person shall
install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type approved by the
Engineer for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from those
other sources.
   The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers may install
and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the volume of
waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial waste
surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type
acceptable to the Engineer.
   The Engineer may require the installation of devices for measuring the
volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records.
   Any metering device for determining the volume of waste discharged to the
public sewer shall be installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following
approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent
of the Engineer.
   (e)   Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject
to periodic inspection with a determination of character and concentration of
such wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may be deemed
necessary by the Engineer but in no case less than two twenty-four hour
composite samples per month. The owner shall be responsible for the collection
and testing of the aforementioned samples.
   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the
composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use of
automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples.
   Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Engineer or his
authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the sample was taken.
   (f)   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial waste
shall be those set forth in the latest edition of Standard Methods. However,
alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used
subject to mutual agreement between the Engineer and the person responsible.
   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes
shall be made by the person responsible for the discharge, or his qualified
agent as approved by the Engineer. The results of the analyses shall be
reported to the City on a monthly basis on forms provided by the City. The City
shall make its own analyses on the wastes and these determinations shall be
binding as a basis for charges, except under circumstances in this subsection.
   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the City result in
substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the City collects its own samples. The results
of the analyses on the samples collected by the City and the industry shall be
compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the latest edition of
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater published by the
American Public Health Association, and the differences negotiated.
(Ord. 75-50. Passed 6-6-75.)
   1042.07   PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the sewerage works. (Ord. 75-50.  Passed 6-16-75.)
   1042.08   POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.

   1043.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this article is the regulation of the collection and
disposal of grease interceptor waste for the protection of the City sanitary
sewer system and the environment when the interceptor is installed outside the
building on the building sewer.  Interceptors installed inside a building are
subject to the requirements of Chapter 10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code (OPC),
adopted by ordinance 2005-23 as part of the Ohio Building Code.
   (b)   The objective of this ordinance is to reduce the operational and
maintenance costs to the City of maintaining the sanitary sewer system by
preventing the accumulation of grease within the collection system lines.
   (c)   This ordinance shall apply to the City of Vermilion and to persons
outside the City who, by contract, agreement or otherwise with the City, are
users of the City's sanitary sewer.
(Ord. 2009-99.  Passed 12-7-09.)
   1043.02  ADMINISTRATION.
   The City of Vermilion shall administer, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this regulation.  (Ord. 2009-99.  Passed 12-7-09.)
   1043.03  APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Waste which contains grease shall be discharged into the sanitary
sewer system only under the conditions of this ordinance.  The following
facilities shall install an adequately sized interceptor and provide an inlet-
flow control-device inspection port and a grease-interceptor effluent
monitoring port:
      (1)   Every commercial and industrial food-processing and food-service
facility as specified in Section 1003.3.1 of the OPC. 
      (2)   Interceptors shall not be required for single-family residences,
duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, apartment complexes, or existing food service
facilities where grease traps are not deemed necessary by the County Board of
Health, unless there are discharges from the property that may create problems
in the sanitary sewer system.  The determination shall be made based upon an
investigation of the property and a comparison of the content and amount of
discharge from the property with the discharges of other properties similar in
size and use.  Upon a determination that the discharges may create problems in
the sanitary sewer system, the City may require the installation of a
sufficiently sized grease interceptor to treat the discharges.  (Ord. 2009-99. 
Passed 12-7-09.)
   1043.04  COMPLIANCE AND TIMELINE.
   (a)   On or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, an existing facility (except those existing facilities described in
Section
1043.03 (b)(2) above), shall be required to install an approved, adequately
sized, and properly operated and maintained grease interceptor when any of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   It is found by the City and/or County Board of Health to be
contributing grease in potential quantities sufficient to inhibit sanitary
sewer flow or necessitate increased maintenance on the sanitary sewer
collection system in order to keep impairments to the main line flow from
occurring.
      (2)   It is remodeling the food preparation or kitchen waste plumbing
facilities in such a manner to be subject to a permit issued by the City
building department.
      (3)   It is required by this or other applicable Ordinance to maintain a
grease interceptor and is found to be equipped with an undersized grease
interceptor as required in Table 1003.3.4.1 of the Ohio Plumbing Code.  Such a
facility shall, within one year of the effective date of this Ordinance,
install an adequately sized grease interceptor in accordance with the
specifications of this Ordinance.
   (b)   New facilities required by the OPC or this ordinance to maintain a
grease interceptor shall install such a unit prior to commencement of discharge

   Floods from stormwater runoff may occasionally occur which exceed the
capacity of storm drainage facilities constructed, operated and/or maintained
by funds made available under this chapter. This chapter does not imply that
property subject to the fees and charges established herein will always be free
from stormwater flooding or flood damage or that stormwater systems capable of
handling all storm events can be cost effectively constructed, operated and/or
maintained. This section shall not create a liability on the part of, or a
cause of action against, the City, or any department or any officer or employee
thereof, for any flood damage that may result from such storms or the runoff

best suit its stormwater needs.  The City may agree to upgrades or
modifications of the existing stormwater system requested by property owners,
so long as such upgrades or modifications comply with the City’s requirements
and are acceptable by the City.  The cost of all upgrades or modifications
requested by property owners shall be paid in full by those owners requesting
same
(Ord. 2011-20.  Passed 4-18-11).
   In summary, stormwater management code allows for the clean out and
restoration of proper function to stormwater systems under the following
criteria:
   (a)   The City will restore existing stormwater systems to the last known
legally acceptable working condition.
   (b)   Property owners are responsible for alteration done to an existing
stormwater system where the alterations do not meet City or State Code, or have
caused a restriction, damage to, or otherwise impede the flow and proper
function of the stormwater system.
   (c)   The City may determine that properties which were originally part of
an open ditch drainage system, will remain so unless the City deems otherwise. 
Property owners wishing to modify, upgrade or enclose an existing open ditch
system will be responsible for the costs.
   (d)   Properties that were originally part of an enclosed or covered system,
will remain closed/covered, unless the City deems otherwise.  Property owners
wishing to modify or upgrade an existing closed system will be responsible for
the costs.
   (e)   The City will be responsible for parts of the stormwater drainage
system that are deemed “community use”, such as outfalls, and road culverts, or
any item within the stormwater system that the City deems necessary for the
proper function of the overall stormwater drainage system.  This may include
some private property improvements at the City’s discretion where oversizing is
required for the overall proper function of the system.
   (f)   Any changes or alterations, or work done to an existing stormwater
system has to have prior written approval of the City of Vermilion.

   1082.01  PURPOSE.
   The intent of this chapter is to comply with the requirements of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Permit No. OHQ100000: Authorization for
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems to Discharge Storm Water Under the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) by establishing
standards to achieve a level of soil erosion and storm water control that will
minimize and abate degradation of land and water resources and damage to public
and private property resulting from earth-disturbing activities involving one
acre or more. Reduction of storm water discharges from construction activity
disturbing less than one acre must be considered if that construction activity
is part of a larger common plan of development or sale that would disturb one
acre or more. In addition, this chapter further intends to:
   (a)       Assure that those involved in earth-disturbing activities minimize
both soil erosion and the volume and rate of storm water runoff from their
sites.
   (b)     Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage and that all storm water management
practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
   (c)     Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil and to
promptly revegetate and stabilize the site following earth-disturbing
activities.
   (d)     Encourage the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes such as flood control, erosion control, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.

including land development proposals for non-agricultural uses and public
infrastructure uses, including transportation and utilities within the City
shall design, develop, and submit a Site Development Plan as described in
Section
 1082.06. Said plan will be evaluated to determine the potential for erosion,
runoff, and sedimentation impacts that may result from such development
activities.
   (b)    A Storm Water Management (SWM) plan shall be prepared as described in
Section
1082.07 to minimize the impacts of increased storm water runoff.
   (c)    No earth-disturbing activity subject to regulation under this chapter
shall be undertaken for any land disturbance equal to or greater than one acre
without an approved Site Development Plan as required under Section
1082.06 and a Storm Water Management (SWM) Plan as required under Section
1082.07.
   (d)    Final approval of a proposed development, redevelopment, street or
utility project shall  not be given unless: .
      (1)    A determination is made by the City Engineer based on submission
of a Site Development Plan as detailed in Section
1082.06 that the proposed earth- disturbing activity will minimize accelerated
runoff, erosion, and/or sediment.
      (2)    A SWM plan has been approved by the City Engineer that determines
that the proposed earth-disturbing activity will not cause accelerated runoff,
erosion, and/or sediment.
      (3)    An Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for Storm Water Best
Management Practices has been approved by the City Engineer and signed by the
Director of Public Service and the Owner.
   (e)    Any person or persons seeking approval to construct a structure shall
be exempted from having to prepare a Site Development Plan and a SWM plan
provided they meet all of the following:
      (1)    Construction takes place on one parcel.
      (2)    The earth-disturbing activity does not affect more than one acre
of the development site at a time.
      (3)    The activity is not located within a floodplain or floodway as
identified by FEMA.
      (4)    The parcel is part of an overall development plan which has
received  approval of a  SWM plan and the developer certifies that they will
comply. with said plan.
   (f)    This chapter does not apply to:
      (1)    Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops
or silviculture  operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment
Pollution Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-309 of the Ohio
Administrative Code).
      (2)    Existing strip mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter

provision of this chapter invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)    These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to abate such
nuisance.
   (d)    Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the owner from
the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall
not result in the City, its officers, employees, or agents being responsible
for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.

an alternate solution as approved by the City Engineer. The engineer shall
design and implement control practices which comply with these and the minimum
requirements in Ohio EPA Permit No. OHC000002, Part III.G.2.
      (2)   Sediment control structures shall be used to control erosion and
trap sediment on a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such
structures may include, but are not limited to, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, sediment basins and diversions or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment basin. All sediment control practices must be capable of pending
runoff in order to be considered functional.
      (3)   Sediment control structures shall be set up within seven days from
the start of grubbing and shall be made functional before other earth-
disturbing activities take place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and
diversions shall be seeded and mulched as soon as the installation is complete.

0.25                          > 2% but < 20%
0.125                         > 20% but < 50%
      (5)   Concentrated storm water runoff from denuded areas flowing at rates
that exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers shall pass through a
sediment-settling facility.  The applicant may use alternative controls to a
sediment-settling pond only if approval is granted by Ohio EPA. If the
applicant proposes to use an alternative control to a sediment-settling
facility, the applicant shall provide the City Engineer with documentation from
Ohio EPA which indicates approval of the alternative controls proposed for the
applicant’s development. This documentation shall be provided at the time of
SWM Plan or site development plan submittal.
      (6)   Storm water diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten acres.
      (7)   A centralized sedimentation basin shall be utilized for common
drainage areas equal to or greater than ten acres.
      (8)   The City Engineer may require sediment basins or traps for smaller
disturbed areas where deemed necessary.
      (9)   If the City Engineer determines that site conditions do not warrant
its construction, based upon hydrological and hydraulic data, the storm water
detention requirement may be modified.
   (j)   Stabilization of Waterways and Outlets.  All on-site storm water
conveyance channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow. Methods adequate to minimize erosion shall also be provided
at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
   (k)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided for on the approved Storm Water
Management Plan, storm sewer inlets shall be protected so that sediment-laden
water will not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or
otherwise treated to remove sediment, unless otherwise approved by the City
Engineer.
      (2)   There shall be no sediment-laden discharges to drainage channels
resulting from dewatering activities. If any sediment-laden ground water is
encountered during trenching activities, then the sediment-laden ground water
must pass through an effective sediment control device prior to being
discharged from the construction site.

and toxic wastes, dumpsters, concrete truck washout pits, and fuel tanks shall
be shown on the Storm Water Management (SWM) plan.
   (l)   Working In or Crossing Streams.
      (1)   Construction activities shall be kept out of streams to the maximum
extent possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken
to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. The channel
(including bed and banks) shall be restored and all disturbed area stabilized
immediately after in-channel work is completed.
      (2)   Where a stream will be crossed regularly during construction, a
non- erodible temporary stream crossing shall be provided.

construction entrance(s) shall be implemented as soon as possible. The
entrances shall be planned and installed according to the requirements in the
most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual or as
directed by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Where soil is transported onto public road surfaces, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly by either sweeping or scraping at the end of each
work day or more frequently, in order to ensure public safety. Street washing
shall be allowed only after shoveling or sweeping has removed most of the
sediment.
      (3)   Erodible material ramps in streets to enable equipment to cross
curbs shall be properly removed immediately after use.
   (n)   Maintenance and Removal of Temporary Measures.
      (1)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired to assure continued performance.
      (2)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days of achieving final site stabilization or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall have the
final grade re-established and be permanently stabilized to prevent further
erosion and sedimentation.
   (o)   Control of Construction Site Debris and Wastes.  All owners,
applicants, contractors and developers shall control wastes such as discarded
building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary
waste on debris from the site to the extent practical. Site management
practices shall be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials,
or other debris from entering drainage channels. These practices shall include,
but are not limited to, the following:

additional containment requirements of the local fire authority must be
followed. If the fuel tanks have a self-contained dike, the plug will be kept
in the dike tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water-based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water-based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
      B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials will
be disposed of in the site’s hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
   (p)   Use, Safety and Maintenance of Storm Water Practices.
      (1)   Storm water management practices shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the site and function safely and with minimal maintenance. Areas
developed for a subdivision shall provide a storm water management system for
the ultimate development of all the subdivided lots.

work is being done contrary to this chapter, such work shall immediately stop.
Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the applicant, and shall
state the conditions under which such work may resume; provided, however, in
instances where immediate action is deemed. necessary for the public safety or
the public interest, the City's authorized agent may require that work be 
stopped upon verbal order pending issuance of the written order.
      (3)    The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City, by or through its Law Director and/or any of its assistants,
from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a Court of proper
jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development, or to restrain, correct, or
abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of this
regulation or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations, or the 
orders of the authorized agent(s) .

   1084.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   This Municipal Facilities/Operations Pollution Prevention/Good
Housekeeping Program (PPGHP) for all City properties and operations has been
prepared for the City of Vermilion Storm Water Management Program (SWMP).
   (b)   The SWMP is approved for coverage under the current edition of the
Ohio EPA NPDES Permit for Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System.
   (c)   The program described in this document has been developed with the
intent to reduce the discharge of pollutants from municipal operations for all
City properties and operations. It is the intent of this program to reduce the
discharge of pollutants from the site to the maximum extent practicable, to
protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate water quality
requirements of Ohio Revised Code 6111 as described in the Ohio EPA Permits.
Specifically, this document addresses pollution prevention and good
housekeeping for municipal operations as described in Control Measure 6 of the
Ohio EPA Permits.  The City of Vermilion is committed to implement pollution
prevention and good housekeeping Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce or
prevent the discharge of pollutants in storm water runoff from municipal
operations and facilities within their municipal separate storm sewer system
(MS4).
   (d)   This PPGHP is the main focus of the program BMPs for Control Measure 6
in the SWMP. This document has been prepared following observations and
inspections of the site and municipal operations. During the inspections, the
existing storm water control measures already in place were documented, and
existing and potential impacts to storm water runoff were noted. Components of
other plans already in place at the facilities (such as spill response and
prevention plans) were incorporated into this PPGHP or expanded upon as
necessary. This PPGHP presents storm water controls that will then be used by
the City of Vermilion to perform regular employee training and to implement and
evaluate BMPs and controls at the facility to fulfill the requirements of the
Ohio EPA permits.
   (e)   The following section of the document describes the municipal site or
operations that are the focus of the storm water BMPs. The remaining sections
of the document contain a description of the BMPs that are recommended to
control storm water pollution from specific municipal activities at the site.
Each section contains BMPs tailored to control storm water impacts for each
particular type of municipal activity or operation. The recommended BMPs will
be implemented on an ongoing basis for the indefinite future.  The City of
Vermilion plans to implement these BMPS or similar controls, wherever they
would be effective at preventing pollutants from discharging with storm water
from the site.
(Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.02  DESCRIPTION OF MUNICIPAL FACILITY AND OPERATIONS.
   (a)   This program is developed for implementation at all City properties. 
The Director of Public Service shall be the primary site contact. The secondary
site contact shall be the department head of that facility.
   (b)   Activities at this site include but not limited to:
      (1)   Vehicle storage and limited fleet maintenance.
      (2)   Storage of aggregate and road repair materials.
      (3)   Storage of winter de-icing materials.
      (4)   Vehicle impound lot.
      (5)   Temporary storage of organic materials.
         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.03  DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED BMPS.
   (a)   Successful storm water pollution control relies in large part of
proper training and education of employees.  Many of the recommended BMPs in
this PPGHP will require specific training for employees who conduct the
activities. It is essential that employees understand and implement the BMPs
that apply to operations within each facility. Training can be completed
separately or done in conjunction with regular employee training procedures.
   (b)   Employee training will emphasize the importance of keeping pollutants
out of the storm drains, because the drains go directly to the surface waters
of the State without benefit of wastewater treatment that the sanitary sewers
receive. Facility personnel will be educated about the harmful environmental
effects of improper disposal of materials into the storm drain so that they
understand the importance of preventing storm water pollution.
   (c)   The following training will be implemented by the City of Vermilion:
      (1)   Experienced workers or other trained personnel will be used to
train facility employees.
      (2)   Training will be completed and documented once per year for all
appropriate personnel.
      (3)   New personnel will be required to review and understand this
document prior to initiating work activities.
         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.04  ELIMINATING ILLICIT AND NON-STORM WATER DISCHARGES.
   (a)     The Ohio EPA Permits prohibit discharges of anything but storm water
to the storm drains. City of Vermilion personnel will inspect the facility to
be sure no unauthorized discharges enter  storm drains or discharge offsite.
Connections that allow sanitary or any sort of wastewater to enter the storm
drain are prohibited, including storm drain connections from indoor drains or
sinks. These are known as illicit connections and must be eliminated.
   (b)   Another form of prohibited discharge is illegal dumping. Pollutants
may be introduced to storm drains inadvertently, by routine practices that
discharge water outdoors, or they may be released intentionally by routinely
discharging wastes, wash water, and other materials to storm drains, catch
basins, and other conveyance facilities either on the facility or in the
street. A large part of this improper discharge results from employees’ lack of
understanding, coupled with a lack of readily available proper routes for the
discharge. Continuing employee training will be needed as described in Section
1084.03.
   (c)   The City of Vermilion will make a long-term ongoing effort to assure
that no illegal discharges will occur from municipal operations at the
facility. This requires continuing observations to identify potential sources
of intentional or inadvertent illicit discharges. Efforts will be made to
discontinue or re-route the storm water from those activities.
   (d)   The following measures to help prevent non-storm water discharges will
be implemented:
      (1)   Provide well-marked proper disposal or collection methods for solid
or liquid waste.
      (2)   Train employees in proper disposal of non-storm water. Employees
will be educated to understand that storm drains connect directly to streams
and other water bodies without treatment.
      (3)   Label all storm drain inlets and catch basins "No dumping-flows to
streams" so employees can tell which inlets are part of the storm drain system.
      (4)   Periodically inspect and maintain the facility operations and BMPS
to evaluate the success of efforts to reduce and eliminate non-storm water
discharges.
      (5)   Periodically inspect and maintain storm drain inlets. Clean out
catch basins so that accumulated pollutants do not wash down the storm drains.
         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.05  SPILL PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND CLEANUP.
   (a)     Even small spills can have cumulative effects that add up to a
significant source of potential pollutants in storm water discharges from the
site. The goal is to prevent spills and leaks, maintain a regular inspection
and repair schedule, and correct potential spill situations before a spill can
occur.
   (b)   When a spill does occur, quick and effective response will prevent
pollutants from reaching storm water. Spills will be cleaned up promptly and
not allowed to evaporate so that pollutants do not remain on the pavement to be
washed to the storm drains with the next rain or remain in the soil to become a
possible groundwater pollutant. If the spill is on an unpaved surface,
personnel will determine whether the contaminated soil should be removed to
prevent it from being a source of future storm water pollutants. Spill
procedures will also include cleaning up leaks, drips, and other spills without
water whenever possible.
   (c)   Spill prevention and response procedures for hazardous materials
stored or handled onsite will follow the procedures described in the facility
Hazardous Materials Management Plan. Properly trained personnel will contain
and collect the spilled substance then dispose of the substances and any
contaminated soil in compliance with local hazardous materials regulations.
   (d)   The spill control and cleanup procedures for this facility are as
follows:
      (1)   Small spills: These are spills that can be wiped up with a shop
rag. Wet rags will not be put in the dumpster with the shop trash - they will
be stored in a covered bin like the kind used at auto service stations. Used
rags will be sent to a professional cleaning service or disposed of with the
hazardous wastes if necessary.
      (2)   Medium-sized spills: These are spills too large to wipe up with a
rag. Medium sized spills will be contained and soaked up using dry absorbent
material such as:
   Vermiculite, specially-prepared sawdust, or kitty litter. Absorbent snakes
may be used as temporary booms to contain and soak up the liquid. Used
absorbent material will be swept up or collected and will be disposed of with
the shop trash if non-hazardous or with the hazardous wastes if necessary. A
wet/dry shop vacuum cleaner may also be used to collect spills and dispose of
the liquid with hazardous wastes. Vacuums will not be used for gasoline,
solvents, or other volatile fluids, because the enclosed vacuum may become an
explosive hazard.
      (3)   Large spills: Spills of non-hazardous liquids will be contained and
cleaned using a minimum amount of wash water. Storm drain inlets or sewer
inlets will be plugged to prevent the spill enter from entering the MS4.
Temporary plugs will be kept onsite for the facility inlets and employees will
be trained in when and how to use them. For hazardous materials spills, the
procedures described in the Hazardous Materials Management Plan will be
implemented.
   (e)   A Spill/Release Incident Reporting form is provided in Appendix A.
This form should be filled out promptly after a spill or release. 
(Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.06   OUTDOOR EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS.
   (a)     The Director of Public Service or Street Department Assistant
Foreman will identify all equipment at the facility that may be exposed to
storm water, or that may discharge potential pollutants that may be exposed to
storm water.
   (b)   An employee will be assigned to inspect each piece of equipment on a
regular basis to see that it is functioning properly. Leaks, malfunctions,
staining on and around the equipment, and other evidence of leaks and
discharges will be observed and noted. The inspecting person will be
responsible for reporting any spills or leaks using the form provided in
Appendix A. Spill and leak control and cleanup activities are described in
Section
1084.05.
   (c)   The equipment operations BMPs for this facility are as follows:
      (1)   Equipment will be placed on an Impermeable surface, or a drip pan
will be installed beneath the potential leak points of the equipment.
      (2)   The amount of rainwater that contacts the equipment will be
minimized wherever possible.
         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.07  OUTDOOR MATERIALS STORAGE AND HANDLING.
   (a)     Outdoor material storage areas will be inspected for possible
exposure of pollutants to storm water runoff. Bulk solid materials, raw
materials, and construction materials, or supplies stored outdoors will be
covered and protected from storm water if pollutants could enter storm water.
Materials of concern on the facility include gravel, sand, lumber, topsoil,
compost, concrete, metal products, and others.
   (b)   The BMPs for the outdoor materials storage and handling areas for this
facility are as follows:
      (1)   Material is stored in one of three ways:
         A.   On a paved surface with a roof or covering so that no direct
rainfall contacts them, and with appropriate berms or runoff controls to
prevent run-on of storm water.
         B.   On a specially constructed paved area with a drainage system with
a slope to minimize water pooling. Prevent runoff and run-on with berms or
curbing along the perimeter. Drainage is directed to treatment facilities or
water quality catch basins along the lower edge of the pad.
         C.   Covered with plastic sheeting, secured with weights such as fires
or sand bags. If possible, a mounded or bermed area that will prevent run-on of
storm water through the material will be used.
      (2)   The parking lot or other surfaces near bulk materials storage
facilities will be swept periodically to remove fines that may wash out of the
materials. Liquid tanks will be kept in a designated area on a paved
impermeable surface and within a berm or other secondary containment.
      (3)   Hazardous materials will be stored as described in the Hazardous
Materials Management Plan and in a manner that ensures storm water protection.
      (4)   Outdoor storage containers will be kept in good condition.
Containers will be inspected regularly for damage or leaks.
      (5)   A portable pumping system will be used that can be moved to
accommodate separate containment structures on the facility. Water can then be
pumped into a truck or portable temporary holding tank. The water then can be
tested and disposed of according to whether any pollutants are present.
      (6)   Road salt storage areas are covered.
      (7)   Salt truck loading areas are swept regularly to minimize salt laden
runoff.  Drainage from the salt truck loading area is captured by an onsite
basin to minimize salt laden discharges from the facility.
         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.08  WASTE HANDLING AND DISPOSAL.
   (a)     This section summarizes the preferred storage and disposal practices
for some common municipal facility wastes. For many wastes, reusing or
recycling is the most cost effective means to prevent pollution.
   (b)   The waste handling and disposal procedures for this facility are as
follows:
      (1)   General shop trash will be kept in a dumpster with the lid closed.
The dumpster is kept in a paved area and kept clean by picking up dropped trash
and sweeping the area regularly.
      (2)   Liquid wastes are kept out of the dumpster and the lid is kept
closed to keep storm water out.
      (3)   Scrap metal or other materials kept outdoors are covered by a roof
or tarpaulin.  Scrap parts or other metals are kept in a shed or under a roof
out of the rain.
      (4)   Waste metal is collected for delivery to a scrap metal dealer.

         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.09  VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT WASHING/STEAM CLEANING.
   Wash water for municipal equipment is discharged to the sanitary sewer and
is not allowed in storm drains. Steam cleaning is done on the facility only in
an area equipped to capture all the water and other wastes. Steam cleaning wash
water is prohibited from storm drains.
   The vehicle and equipment washing/steam cleaning BMPs for this facility are
as follows:
   (a)   Vehicles and equipment are washed only in designated areas.
   (b)   Wash areas are paved and clearly marked.
   (c)   Sumps or drain lines are installed to collect wash water for treatment
and discharge to the sanitary sewer; reuse (for repeated washings); or recycle
(used elsewhere onsite).
   (d)   The wash area is graded or bermed to prevent storm water run on.
   (e)   Washing takes place on gravel, grass, or other permeable surfaces.
   (f)   Use only biodegradable soaps.
   (g)   Equipment and vehicle washing takes place inside a building designed
for maintenance or equipment storage. All drains from the wash area are
connected to the sanitary sewer and no storm water contacts the area.
   (h)   A commercial car wash is used to wash the facility vehicles and
equipment.
      (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.10  MATERIALS RECEIVING AREAS.
   (a)     Truck loading and unloading areas are potential sources of potential
pollutants when rainfall and run-on contact spilled raw materials, dust, and
motor fluids that accumulate in these areas.
   (b)   The BMPs for the designated loading and unloading areas are as
follows:
      (1)   Shipments are inspected for leaked motor fluids, spilled materials,
debris, and other foreign materials.
      (2)   The loading and unloading area must be swept.
         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.11  VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE AREAS.
   Whenever possible, vehicle and equipment maintenance is performed in an
indoor garage. Outdoor vehicle maintenance takes place in an area designated
for vehicle maintenance.
   (a)   The following are the selected BMPs for vehicle and equipment
maintenance at the facility:
      (1)   Equipment will be kept clean so that a buildup of grease and oil
will not wash away when the equipment is exposed to rain.
      (2)   Vehicle and equipment maintenance areas are paved with concrete
wherever possible.
      (3)   Drip pans or containers are kept under the vehicles at all times
during maintenance.
      (4)   Fluids are drained from any retired vehicles kept on-site for scrap
or parts, Stored or out-of service vehicles awaiting restoration or service,
and vehicles being held for resale are checked periodically for leakage. Drip
pans or containers are to be kept under the vehicles.
      (5)   A berm or other runoff controls will be installed to prevent run-on
and run-off Drainage will be directed to a connection to the sanitary sewer
system.
   (b)   Vehicle and equipment storage areas will be operated with some similar
precautions:
      (1)   Vehicles and equipment will be inspected to identify sources of
spills or leaks.  Designated facility personnel will perform regular walk-by
inspection.
      (2)   The equipment yard will be kept clean and clear of debris and
litter because any runoff then becomes an illegal discharge to the storm drain.
      (3)   Storm drain inlets will be cleaned on a regular schedule and also
after large storms. Special attention will be paid to the kinds of potential
pollutants that accumulate there as a result of facility activities so that
appropriate measures can be taken to control any pollutant sources.
      (4)   Improvements to a vehicle or equipment storage areas should grade
the area to slope to a longitudinal drain, or install curbs to direct all
direct storm water to a single point of discharge to easily visually monitor
the storm water discharge. If the vehicle or equipment yard is a large source
of oily materials, then the inlet will be fitted with an oil/water separator or
oil/grease trap.
      (5)   Consistent parking spots will be designated for each vehicle so
that if a leak is indicated on the ground, the truck can be identified and
repaired,
      (6)   A special area will be constructed for the facility’s dirtiest
equipment (tar equipment, asphalt paving equipment, etc.) in order to handle
the discharges, leaks, and runoff separately with more intensive BMPs.
      (7)   Spills will be cleaned up promptly; using dry cleanup procedures
described in Section
1084.05.
         (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.12  VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT FUELING AREAS.
   (a)     Vehicle and equipment fueling areas are designed and operated to
minimize the potential for spilled fuel and leaked fluids coming into contact
with storm water. Even very small spills, when they happen every day, add up to
a lot of fuel in the drainage system.
   (b)   The following are the selected BMPs for the proper operation of a
fueling area at the facility:
      (1)   A paved area or concrete slab will be used for the fueling area
(concrete is preferred because fuel and oils cause asphalt to deteriorate).
      (2)   Gasoline overflows and spills will be cleaned using dry methods as
described in Section
1084.05. Spills will not be allowed to run off or evaporate, and will not be
flushed with a hose. Absorbent material will be used and disposed of as
described in Section
1084.05.
      (3)   Dry cleanup materials will be kept in the fueling area, and
employees will be instructed in the proper dry clean up methods described in
Section
1084.05. Facility personnel will inspect the area every day for gasoline, motor
oil, or other fluids that may have leaked.
      (4)   All fuels must be in an approved, properly marked container and
stored in an approved explosion proof cabinet.
      (5)   All large vehicles shall be fueled offsite at an approved
commercial fueling business.  (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.13  FACILITY GOOD HOUSEKEEPING ACTIVITIES.
   The following good housekeeping practices will be implemented on a regular
basis:
   (a)   Facility clean-up will be completed without water whenever possible,
by sweeping or wiping, or washing with as little water as possible.
   (b)   Rooftop drains or downspouts will be arranged so they don't drain
directly onto paved surfaces wherever possible.
   (c)   The storm water conveyance system will be kept clear of debris and
litter to avoid blockage that may cause storm water to back up and to avoid the
discharge of illicit materials.
   (d)   Storm drain inlets will be cleaned regularly to remove sediment and
debris.  Inlets will be inspected after each large storm to remove debris; and
determine whether additional facility BMPS may be required.
   (e)   Catch basins will be cleaned out annually, shortly before the wet
weather season. 
(Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.14  FACILITY AND MUNICIPAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.
   (a)    This section describes the BMPs to be implemented at all City of
Vermilion properties for building repairs, remodeling, and minor construction
projects that involve an area of disturbance less than one acre in size.
   (b)    Larger-scale projects, such as the construction of new facilities
that disturb greater than one acre of ground must satisfy the requirements of
the Ohio EPA Construction Permit (Ohio EPA Permit No.OHC000004) effective
Apri121, 2013. These require more extensive storm water pollution prevention
measures than described here. 
   (c)    The following BMPs will be implemented for minor construction and
remodeling activities at the facility:
      (1)    Building materials will be stored under cover or in contained
areas. Impermeable tarp will be put over piles of wood, or other materials.
      (2)    The working area will be kept clean. Wood splinters, paint chips,
and other residues will be swept every day; as well as a thorough cleanup at
the end of the project.
      (3)    Impermeable ground cloths, such as plastic sheeting, will be used
during painting.
      (4)    Paint buckets and barrels of materials will be stored away from
contact with storm water at the end of the work day.
      (5)    Paint spills will be treated as a chemical spill and will be
captured before it flows to the storm drain. Paint will be cleaned it up
promptly using dry methods.
      (6)    Water based paint brushes and equipment will be cleaned in a sink
connected to the sanitary sewer. Oil-based paint will materials will be cleaned
where the waste paint and solvents can be collected to be handled as small
quantity hazardous waste do not pour it to the sink or to a storm drain.
      (7)    Tarps or drop cloths will be hung to minimize the spread of
windblown materials.
      (8)    Sand blasting areas will be controlled to keep particles off of
paved surfaces and out of storm drains.
      (9)    Excess chemicals will be soaked up with absorbent material or rags
rather than allowing them to flow to the storm drains or soak into the soil. If
chemicals spill, they will be cleaned up promptly using dry techniques (see
Section
1084.05).
         (Ord.  2017-5.  Passed 3-6-16.)
   1084.15  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT: WATER QUALITY CONTROLS.
   The following features will be added to various parts of the storm water
conveyance system at the City properties to help control potential pollutants
in the storm water before it leaves the site:
   (a)   Oil-Absorbent Materials.  Oils and greases storm water can be removed
using oil absorbent materials to contain oil spills. The absorbent material
preferentially absorbs oil, and does not fill with water, so it can be used on
storm water with small concentrations of oily materials.
   (b)   Permanent floating booms.  Installed in storm water ditches to control
occasional light surface sheen. When the boom is spent, it is full of oil and
is visibly heavier, and floats lower in the water. The booms are inexpensive
enough that they may easily be replaced whenever the absorbent is saturated.
   (c)   Vegetated Swale or Channel.  Plants provide peak flow control by
slowing the water and remove some pollutants by encouraging the deposition of
sediments and intercepting oily wastes that may be in the water. This control
can be retrofitted to an existing storm water conveyance simply by allowing
grasses to grow, if it does not interfere with storm water drainage and cause
water to back up onto the site.
   (d)   Catch Basin Filters.  Storm drain inlets or inlet inserts that
contains filtration media or other design features to removes particulates and
oily wastes from storm water as it enters the storm drain.
      (Ord. 2011-44.  Passed 8-1-11.)
   1084.16 REPORTING AND RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    This document and the facility operations shall be reviewed and
updated annually to reflect changing site conditions and the effectiveness of
the BMPs at the City properties. All changes to this PPGHP will be documented.
A copy of this document and any revisions to the program described herein will
be kept on file in the office of the Director of Public Service at all times
and a copy of all documentation will be included in the Annual Report.
   (b)    Annual Site Inspection. The Director of Public Service or designated
representative will yearly inspect the municipal site operations at all City
properties annually using the Annual Site Inspection Form provided in Appendix
A. The completed form should be keep onsite indefinitely and a copy should be
sent promptly to the Director of Public Service for the preparation of the
Annual Report.
   (c)    Non-Storm Water Discharge Visual Inspection. The Director of Public
Service or designated representative will inspect all City properties for non-
storm water (or illicit) discharges. A non-storm water discharge visual
inspection form is provided in Appendix A. The completed form should be keep
onsite indefinitely and a copy should be sent promptly to the Director of
Public Service.
   (d)    Storm Water Discharge Visual Inspection. The Director of Public
Service or designated representative will inspect all City properties storm
water discharges during storm events. A storm water discharge visual inspection
form is provided in Appendix A. The completed form should be keep onsite
indefinitely and a copy should be sent promptly to the Director of Public
Service.

access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4, or to the surface waters of the State. If the violator fails to comply
with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Director of Public Service
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
MS4 or the surface waters of the State, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 Access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
Director of Public Service. will notify a violator of the proposed termination
of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Director of Public Service for
a reconsideration and hearing.
   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the Director
of Public Service.
(Ord. 2011-45.  Passed 9-19-11.)
   1085.08  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
Director of Public Service prior to allowing discharges to the MS4.  (Ord.
2011-45.  Passed 9-19-11.)
   1085.09  MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)    Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program:  The City of Vermilion hereby establishes a program to
detect and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4.
This program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and
home sewage treatment systems, the routine inspection of storm water outfalls
to the MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry
weather flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)    Inspection of Residential. Commercial. Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)   The Director of Public Service, or his or her designated
representative, shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
this regulation as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
regulation when there is reason to suspect or evidence of an illicit discharge
or illegal connection.
      (2)    The Director of Public Service, or his or her designated
representative, shall have the right to set up at facilities subject to this
regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring and/or sampling
of the facility's storm discharge or connection.
      (3)    The Director of Public Service, or his or her designated
representative, shall have the right to require the facility owner/operator to
install monitoring equipment as necessary when an illicit discharge has
occurred and there is reason to suspect the possibility of a reoccurrence.
Tills sampling and monitoring equipment shall he maintained at all times in
safe and proper operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the
owner/operator's expense.
      (4)    Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Vermilion access to a
facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge or
illegal connection inspection when there is reason to suspect or evidence of an
illicit discharge or illegal connection is a violation of this chapter.
         (Ord. 2011-45.  Passed 9-19-11.)
   1085.10  REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The City of Vermilion will adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or the surface waters of the State. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the
use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.  Compliance with
all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,

   1240.01  SHORT TITLE.
   The official name of these Subdivision Regulations and this Title Four shall
be "Subdivision Regulations of the City of Vermilion, Ohio," hereinafter known
as "these Regulations." (Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1240.02   AUTHORITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission derives its authority to regulate subdivisions by
virtue of the City Charter and in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 711. The
Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations governing plats and
subdivisions of land falling within its jurisdiction.
   Additionally, the Commission has the power to recommend to Council land use
variances in the application of both the Subdivision Regulations and the Zoning
Code. Such recommendatory variance powers reserved to the Commission shall
concern subdivision regulations and general community planning enactments, as
applied to specific areas or parcels, so as to vary or permit limited
exceptions to previously legislated standards in the interests of justice and
to avoid unreasonable hardships and spot zonings. No variance shall be deemed
final until authorized by action of Council. Nothing in this section shall be
deemed to modify or impair the powers and duties of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, but rather to supplement the restriction placed upon the Board by
Section
1264.07  regarding the inability of the Board to vary legislated zoning or
subdivision regulations.
(Ord. 78-64. Passed 7-17-78.)
   1240.03   PURPOSES.

existing or planned streets or highways or to City or regional plans.
   (b)   Adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access of
fire fighting apparatus, recreation, light, air and for the avoidance of
congestion of population.  (Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1240.04   JURISDICTION.
   These Regulations shall apply to all subdivisions hereinafter made of all
land within the City and land within three miles of the City as provided in
Ohio R.C. 711.09, unless the City Planning Commission with subdivision
jurisdiction over such unincorporated territory shall agree by written
agreement that the approval of a plat  by the City Planning Commission shall be
contingent upon receiving advice or approval by the Lorain County Regional
Planning Commission or the Erie County Regional Planning Commission, for such
land located in either county.
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1240.05   INTERPRETATION.
   The provisions of these Regulations shall be held to be minimum
requirements.  Where these Regulations impose a greater restriction than is
required by existing laws, covenants, rules, regulations or restrictions, the
provisions of these Regulations shall govern. (Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1240.06   RELATIONSHIP TO ZONING.
   Whenever a proposed subdivision is located in an area that is zoned under
the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapters 713 or 519, it shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning plan except as specified in Section
1240.05 .
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1240.07   DIVISIONS OF LAND NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS.
   Divisions of land not subject to these Regulations are as follows:

   1244.01   SUBDIVISIONS INVOLVING NOT MORE THAN TWO LOTS.
   (a)   Whenever a division of a parcel of land shown as a unit on the last
preceding tax roll (duplicate) is proposed along an existing public street not
involving the opening, widening or extension of any street or road, and
involving no more than two lots (including any so-called “remainder” lots), the
division shall be submitted to the Commission for action without a plat.  The
Commission shall take action with respect to such proposed division at the
first regular meeting which is not less than ten days after receipt of the
items required by this Section.  If the Commission is satisfied that such
proposed division is not contrary to applicable platting, subdividing or zoning
regulations it shall, at such meeting, or within three working days thereafter,
approve such proposed division.  On presentation of a conveyance of such
parcel, the same shall be stamped “Approved, City of Vermilion Planning
Commission” and signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the Commission.
   (b)   A survey, prepared by a registered professional surveyor licensed in
the State of Ohio, showing location and dimensions of property being
subdivided, the property lines of all abutting property, the proposed use and
general location of buildings, and such other information as may be necessary,
shall be required.
(Ord. 2005-28.  Passed 7-18-05.)
   1244.02  SUBDIVISIONS INVOLVING MORE THAN TWO LOTS.
   No person, firm or corporation proposing to lay out or have laid out, within
the territorial jurisdiction of these Regulations, a subdivision which includes
more than two lots, or which involves the opening, widening or extension of any
street or road, shall proceed with any construction work on the proposed
subdivision, including grading, before obtaining from the Commission the
approval of the preliminary plan of the proposed subdivision.
   (a)   Preliminary Plan.
      (1)   General.  The subdivider shall have prepared a preliminary plan,
together with plans and specifications of improvements as required by Section
1244.03 .
      (2)   Filing.  A tracing and four copies of the preliminary plan and
supplementary material specified, including fees as established by Planning
Commission regulations, shall be submitted to the Commission with written
application for approval.
      (3)   Approval.  The Commission, acting through the City Engineer, shall,
within sixty days or within such further time as the applicant may agree to,
review the preliminary plan and other material submitted for conformity thereof
to these Regulations and advise the subdivider on changes deemed advisable. 
The Commission shall inform the subdivider as to which public offices must be
contacted by him to determine the nature and extent of the improvements
required.
         A.   Upon completion of the review, the action of the Commission shall
be noted on the tracing and four copies of the preliminary plan, attached to
any conditions determined necessary for approval.  Four copies shall be
retained by the Commission and the tracing returned to the subdivider.
         B.   Approval of the preliminary plan shall not constitute approval of
the subdivision plat.  Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of the approval
of the layout as returned to the subdivider on the preliminary plan, as a guide
to the preparation of the subdivision plat which will be submitted for approval
of the Commission, and for recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of
these Regulations.
         C.   If the Commission does not render a decision on the preliminary
plat within the sixty days stipulated in paragraph (a)(3) hereof, or such
further time as the applicant may agree to, nothing in these Regulations shall
prohibit the subdivider from officially filing his subdivision plat with the
Commission.
   (b)   Subdivision Plat (Final Plan).
      (1)   General.  The subdivision plat shall conform to the preliminary
plan, except where changes are agreed upon between the Commission and the
subdivider, and it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary
plan which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time, provided
that such portion conforms with all the requirements of these Regulations.
      (2)   Submission of plans.  After receiving notice of approval of the
preliminary plan, if the subdivider desires to proceed, the subdivider shall
proceed to file:
         A.   The original tracing, plus two copies of the subdivision plat as
required under Section
1244.04.
         B.   A certificate from the City Engineer, County Engineer and
Sanitary Engineer, if they are involved, that a performance agreement and
bonds, or other guarantee or security acceptable to the City and the Board of

formal provisions of these Regulations.

and County office by the subdivider as directed by the Commission or Engineer.
      (3)   Filing.  The subdivision plat shall be filed with the Commission
not later than twenty-four months after the date of approval of the preliminary
plan; otherwise it will be considered void unless an extension is requested by
the developer and granted by the Commission.
         The subdivision plat shall be considered officially filed (submission
of the plat for approval) after it has been submitted to the Commission, after
reports have been received from the City Engineer, the County Board of Health
or any other applicable agency involved, and after it is found to be in full
compliance with the formal provisions of these Regulations.  The official
filing shall take place at least ten working days prior to the meeting at which
it is to be considered by the Commission.
      (4)   Commission approved.  The approval of the Commission or the refusal
to approve shall take place within sixty days after the submission of the plat
for approval; otherwise such plat is deemed approved, and the certificate of
the Commission as to the date of the submission of the plat for approval and
the failure to take action thereon within such time shall be sufficient in lieu
of the written endorsement or evidence of approval required by this section. 
The ground of refusal of approval of any plat submitted, including citation of
or reference to the rule or regulation violated by the plat, shall be stated
upon the record of the Commission.
         The subdivider shall be notified of the final action of the
Commission, and the City shall record the subdivision plat in the office of the
Recorder of Lorain County or Erie County within sixty days after the date of
approval, unless an extension is agreed to by the Commission; otherwise the
Commission may recall the plat for its reconsideration.  The City shall have
made, at the expense of the subdivider, a mylar reproducible tracing and four
copies of the recorded plat.
      (5)   Building permits.  No building permit shall be issued until the
applicant has full complied with these Regulations.

any public land and acceptance for any easement, before it is recorded.  The
acceptance of any street or utility for public use and maintenance shall be by
separate action of Council.

   1246.01   GENERAL PROCEDURE; INTENT.
   (a)   Preliminary and final site development plans for proposed projects in
any Multiple Family Use District shall be submitted to and reviewed by the
Planning Commission in three stages:
(1)   Preapplication procedure.
(2)   Submission of preliminary site development plan.
(3)   Submission of final site development plan and building elevation and
floor plan drawings of the proposed building.
   (b)   It is the intent of this procedure to insure that all parties are
specifically aware of significant aspects of the proposed development and that
the public interest is met in terms of the provision of air, sunlight, open
space, access for vehicles (including ambulances and fire fighting equipment),
orientation, separation of buildings, area densities and related items.
(Ord. 74-57. Passed 6-17-74.)
   1246.02  COORDINATION WITH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The requirements of this chapter shall be in addition to other
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations, where applicable. Where the
regulations of this chapter are in conflict with other provisions of these
Regulations, the Planning Commission shall determine which shall apply.
Subdivision plats shall be in full compliance with and contain all information
required by these Regulations.
   (b)   If the proposed development meets the requirements for the subdivision
of land under these Regulations, the preliminary subdivision plan shall be
submitted simultaneously with the preliminary site development plan, and the
final subdivision plat shall be submitted simultaneously with the final site
development plan and building plans. (Ord. 74-57. Passed 6-17-74.)
   1246.03   REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF PLANS.
   (a)   No building permits shall be issued and no building shall be permitted
within Multiple Family Use Districts until the final site development and
building plans have been approved by the Planning Commission. Prior to the
granting of the building permit, the Building Inspector shall receive from the
Planning Commission a signed copy of the approved final site development and
building plans.
 
   (b)   The Planning Commission may approve the plans as submitted, amend or
disapprove the plans. The Commission may impose such reasonable conditions as
necessary upon its approval including the recording of covenants.
 
   (c)   The Secretary of the Planning Commission shall be notified at least
ten working days preceding the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting
by the developer of his intent to submit the preliminary site development plan
or the final site development and building plans.
 
   (d)   The Commission shall review and take action upon the plans submitted
within thirty days, or within such further time as the applicant may agree to.
Upon completion of the review, the action of the Commission shall be noted on
two copies of all submitted plans, referenced and attached to any condition
determined necessary for approval. One copy shall be retained by the Commission
and filed with the records of the City, and the other returned to the
applicant.
 
   (e)   Upon approval of the submitted plans, the signature of the Chairman of
the Planning Commission shall be affixed to all documents. Building permits may
then be issued. If the Commission determines that a plan should be disapproved
and a building permit cannot be issued, the Commission shall forthwith spread
upon its records the reasons for such determination and shall transmit to the
applicant an attested copy of the reasons and recommendations thereon.
 
   (f)   Approval of plans shall be conditional upon compliance with all other
applicable statutes, ordinances, resolutions and regulations of the City and
State of Ohio. (Ord. 74-57. Passed 6-17-74.)

   1248.01  CONFORMITY WITH CITY PLANS; DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Conformity With Thorofare and Park and Recreation Plans. All proposed
subdivisions shall conform to the Official Thorofare Plan of the City and the
City Park and Recreation Plan and any subsequent revisions thereof.
   (b)   Drainage.
(1)   General. The Planning Commission shall not approve any subdivision having
inadequate storm and/or sanitary drainage, as determined by the City Engineer
and the County Engineer and Sanitary Engineer if these County officials are
involved. The City Engineer shall require the subdivider to design a system of
storm sewers through the area being subdivided to satisfactorily drain the
entire area, which may be owned by others, which would naturally drain to Lake
Erie or to the Vermilion River as indicated by the current United States
Geological Survey Map. The eventual use of the higher land shall be considered
when designing the system of sewers.  The City Engineer shall also require the
subdivider to design the sanitary sewerage in the area being subdivided to
satisfactorily drain the entire area, which may be owned by others, which would
naturally drain to the Vermilion City Sewage Treatment Plant as shown on the
Burgess and Niple Sanitary Sewage Report dated July, 1972. The eventual use of
the higher land shall be considered when designing the system of sewers. It is
recognized that this may require the subdivider to install trunk size sewers
which are larger in size and at greater depth than would be required to service
the immediate area being subdivided.
         (Ord. 74-42. Passed 5-6-74.)
(2)   Protection of drainage courses. No natural drainage course shall be
altered and no fill, buildings or structures shall be placed in it, unless
approved by the City Engineer, or the County Engineer, if he is involved.  The
City or County Engineer may require that an easement be provided.
         (Ord. 850.  Passed 7-1-63.)
   1248.02   PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section 1248.02 was repealed by Ordinance 00-19, passed
June 12, 2000.  See Chapter
1249 .)
   1248.03   TREES.
   Any street trees located within the street right of way, or any easements
that may be adjacent to the street right of way, shall be planted only where
allowed by the Director of Public Service. The type of trees permitted to be
planted must be approved by the Director. No trees will be planted as to impair
visibility at any corner or corners.
(Ord. 75-72A. Passed 9-8-75.)
   1248.04   SUBDIVISION NAME.
   The subdivision name shall not duplicate, be similar to, or be in conflict
with, the name of any existing subdivision in the City and in Lorain or Erie
County, or any previously planned subdivision under consideration by the
Commission.
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1248.05   STREET NAMES.
   Names of new streets shall not duplicate, or be similar to, existing
dedicated streets. New streets which are extensions of or in alignment with
existing streets shall bear the name of the existing streets. All new streets
shall be named in the following manner unless the Commission grants permission
to do otherwise.
   (a)   Street names and signs shall be the type and design specified by the
City standards for street name signs.
   (b)   All street names shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
      (Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1248.06   LOT IDENTIFICATION.
   All lots shall be numbered by progressive numbers throughout the proposed
subdivision. The lots in numbered additions bearing the same name shall be
consecutive throughout the several additions. Where land is subdivided into
more than one subdivision by the same developer, the lots in each subdivision
shall be so numbered that the lots will bear the same consecutive numbers.
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1248.07  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   Off-street parking and loading requirements shall be in accordance with
those specified in the Zoning Code. (Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1248.08  EASEMENTS; UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC CABLE.
   Private and public utility easements shall have a minimum width of ten feet
or such additional width as may be required by the Planning Commission for
necessary access to the utility involved. Such easements shall be located along
rear or side lot lines with five feet thereof being located on each side of
such lot lines, except under special circumstances where the Commission may
require them in other locations. For lots facing curvilinear streets, the rear
easement shall consist of straight lines with a minimum of points of
deflection. Streets with a fifty-foot right of way shall have easements five
feet wide along front lot lines. Electrical power supply cable or cables with a
potential of over 250 volts measured to "ground" which are buried beneath the
surface of the earth shall have an effectively grounded concentric sheath,
shield or spiral wire of conductivity at least equal to the phase conductor and
in contact with the earth.
(Ord. 74-42. Passed 5-6-74.)
   1248.09   STREETS.
   (a)   General. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location
of all streets shall conform to the Official Thorofare Plan, or subsequent
amendments thereof, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served
by such streets.
   As to arrangement, the subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the
subdivision plat the necessary right of way for the widening, continuance or
alignment of such streets in conformity with the Official Thorofare Plan by one
of the following methods:
(1)   The necessary right of way for the continuation, extension or connection
of any present or planned thorofare shall be dedicated.
(2)   When subdividing the land fronting on an existing road or street not
designated on the Official Thorofare Plan as equal to or of greater importance
than an auxiliary street, a reasonable provision shall be made for necessary
rights of way or easements for traffic, utilities and drainage.
   (b)   Major Traffic Arteries and Physical Barriers.
(1)   Traffic arteries. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed street of equal or greater width than a secondary thorofare as shown
on the Official Thorofare Plan, the Planning Commission may require any of the
following:
         A.   Marginal access streets.
         B.   Reverse frontage with planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line or a planting strip of a minimum width
of twenty feet on the rear of the lots with no vehicular access across such
strip.
         C.   Deep lots with rear service alleys.
         D.   Such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection
of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
(2)   Physical barriers. Where a subdivision borders on, or contains a railroad
right of way or limited access highway right of way, the Commission may require
a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right of way at a
distance suitable for necessary traffic circulation.
   (c)   Arrangement.
(1)   Traffic. Minor streets, as defined herein and on the Official Thorofare
Plan, shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged.
(2)   Access to adjacent property. The street layout shall make provision for
the proper protection and continuance of streets and all utilities into
adjacent unsubdivided acreage where it is deemed appropriate and desirable by
the Commission. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited.
(3)   Future street system. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part
of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require a sketch of a
tentative future street system for the unsubdivided portion.
   (d)   Alignment.
(1)   Horizontal.
         A.   Jogs. No street layouts with center line offsets of less than 125
feet shall be permitted without consent of the Commission. 
         B.   Angle of intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect
any other street at less than sixty degrees.
         C.   Intersection approaches. Approaches to street intersections shall
be straight for a distance of at least 100 feet from the center line of the
street intersected.
         D.   Reverse curves. A tangent at least 200 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on all but minor and marginal access streets.
(2)   Vertical. Approaches to intersections shall be reduced to grade not
exceeding three percent for a distance of at least 150 feet. The Commission may
modify this requirement when an unreasonable hardship would result from its
strict enforcement.
   (e)   Classification. The Commission approving each street in a proposed
subdivision shall be governed by the following standards:
(1)   For main and secondary thorofares, the minimum radius of curvature shall
be 300 feet on the center lines, for minor streets, 100 feet, and for local
service streets, seventy-five feet.
(2)   All horizontal curves shall show the complete functions of such curves
and each P.C. and P.T. shall be stationed.
(3)   Profiles and grades of all proposed streets shall be the center line
grades of the respective streets and shall be indicated in complete detail in
the profiles and referenced to the stationing shown on the plan.
      The maximum grades shall not exceed seven percent for main and secondary
thorofares, or fourteen percent for minor or local service streets. The minimum
grade for all classifications of streets shall be not less than four-tenths of
one percent.
      All major changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length equal to fifteen times the algebraic difference in rate of grade
for thoroughfares, and one-half this minimum length for minor local service
streets.
      The P.C. and P.T. of all vertical curves shall be stationed and
elevations shall be shown at least every twenty-five feet within the limits of
the vertical curves.
   (f)   Corner Radii at Intersections. Property lines at street right-of-way
intersections shall be rounded with a radius of twenty-five feet or of a
greater radius where the Commission may deem it necessary.
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63; Ord. 74-42. Passed 5-6-74.)
   (g)   Dead-End Streets.
      (1)   Permanent. Dead-end streets (cul-de-sac), designed to be so
permanently, shall not be longer than 1,000 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turnaround having a street property line diameter of at least
110 feet. The street right-of-way lines and the 110-foot diameter turnaround
should be joined by tangent arcs of fifty foot minimum radius.
      (2)   Temporary.
         A.   Where streets are extended to the boundary of a subdivision to
provide for their proper continuance at such time as the adjacent land is
subdivided, they may be terminated within the right of way in such manner as
required by the Commission.
         B.   If a street extends only one lot in depth past a street
intersection, no turn-around is required.
         C.   Temporary cul-de-sacs in subdivisions may be constructed with
alternative materials and to specifications approved by the City Engineer for a
period of time not to exceed two (2) years from city acceptance of the
subdivision plat.  If the streets are not extended after two years the
developer is required to install the permanent cul-de-sac per city standards at
their cost.  The developer shall provide a performance bond equal to 110
percent of the engineer’s estimated construction cost for an asphalt or
concrete cul-de-sac.  During the two-year period any maintenance or repair of
the temporary cul-de-sac will be the developers responsibility.
            (Ord. 2007-43.  Passed 7-16-07.)
   (h)   Half-Streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited except under one of the
following conditions:
(1)   There exists a half-street which should logically be continued to a
reasonable intersection.
(2)   There exists a dedicated or platted half-street adjacent to the tract to
be subdivided; the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Commission. 
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1.63; Ord. 74-42. Passed 5-6-74.)
   1248.10   ALLEYS.
   (a)   Required. Alleys shall be provided in apartment, commercial and
industrial districts, except where other definite and assured provision is made
for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking,
consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
 
   (b)   Prohibited. Alleys shall be prohibited in one and two-family
districts, except where it is desirable to continue an existing alley to the
nearest intersection or where the lots face a street shown on the Official
Thorofare Plan and provision has not or cannot be made for limited access on
such street.
 
   (c)   Width. The minimum width of an alley shall be twenty feet.
 
   (d)   Intersections. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment
shall be avoided, but, where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently
to permit safe vehicular movement.
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63; Ord. 74-42. Passed 5-6-74.)
 
   1248.11   BLOCKS.
   (a)   Dimensions and Shape Considerations. The lengths, widths and shapes of
blocks shall be determined with due regard to the following:
(1)   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the
type of use contemplated.
(2)   Zoning requirements and the requirements contained in these Regulations
as to lot size and dimension.
(3)   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street
traffic.
(4)   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
   (Ord. 850.  Passed 7-1-63.)
   (b)   Length. Blocks shall not exceed 1,800 feet in length except where
topographical conditions require longer blocks, nor shall they be less than 400
feet in length. Wherever blocks are longer than 1,800 feet, crosswalk easements
not less than twenty feet in width shall be required near the center of the
block. The Planning Commission shall require that Portland cement concrete
sidewalks five feet in width be provided in the crosswalk easement.
(Ord. 74-42.  Passed 5-6-74.)
 
   (c)   Width. Blocks shall contain two rows of lots except where double and
reverse frontage lots are allowed.  (Ord. 850.  Passed 7-1-63.)
   1248.12  LOTS.
   (a)   General. The lot size, width, depth, shape, orientation and the
minimum setback line shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision
and for the type of development and use contemplated, in order to secure and
provide for the proper arrangement of streets or other highways in relation to
existing or planned streets or highways or to the City plan for adequate and
convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access of fire fighting
apparatus, recreation, light, air and for the avoidance of congestion of
population.
   Lots shall meet all lawful requirements as adopted by the various
governmental subdivisions or public agencies having jurisdiction over this
problem.
   The Commission may limit to a maximum ratio of three and one-half to one the
depth to width of lots for the most efficient use of land.
   All lots shall conform to the area requirements of the Zoning Code of the
City.
   (b)   Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width
where necessary to permit a required building setback from and orientation to
both streets. (Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
 
   (c)   Ingress and Egress. The land shall be subdivided so as to provide each
lot with frontage on a public street. (Ord. 74-42. Passed 5-6-74.)
 
   (d)   Double and Reverse Frontage. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots
may be allowed where they are essential to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least twenty feet,
and across which there would be no right of access, should be provided along
the line of lots abutting such traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
 
   (e)   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles
or radial to street lines.
 
   (f)   Building Setback Lines. Building setback lines shall be in accordance
with those specified in the Zoning Code of the City.
(Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   1248.13  SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks shall be required in accordance with Chapter
1250  and the Standard Construction Drawings of these Regulations.

   1249.01   FINDINGS; PURPOSE; INTENT.
   It is hereby determined that: (i) continuing development within the City has
placed a strain on the City's parks and other recreational facilities; (ii) the
City requires additional revenues to provide the residents of the City with
appropriate recreational facilities; and (iii) a portion of the burden should
be borne by the developers and purchasers, who are incidentally but not totally
responsible, and the remaining share of the cost should be borne by the
residents of the City, who will also be using the facilities. The fees assessed
pursuant to this chapter, along with monies derived from other Municipal funds,
shall be used for the planning, acquisition, improvement and expansion of
public parks, playgrounds and other recreational facilities to serve the
increasing growth and development of the City. It is the purpose of this
chapter to assure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost
of expenditures necessary to provide such recreational facilities in the City.
It is Council's intention that the fees collected pursuant to this chapter
shall be supplemented by appropriations from the general revenue and committed
to park and recreation purposes.

   1250.01   PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL.
   After approval for recording of the dedication plat by the Planning
Commission, the following procedure shall be followed:
   (a)   The engineer of the subdivision shall consult the City Engineer as to
the engineering details required for all improvements. The requirement of
street lighting facilities, either underground or above ground, shall be
recommended and approved by the City Engineer and the Commission. In fulfilling
such obligation, the subdivider shall plan or cause to be planned the
installation of street lighting facilities pursuant to certain agreements
between the subdivider and the electric utility company which are consonant
with any existing contracts between the City and such utility company. The
subdivider is required to grant unto such utility company all easements
necessary for the initial installation, operation and maintenance of street
lighting facilities, all of which shall be accomplished before the final
acceptance of such subdivision.
      Where the subdivision is outside the City and within the three-mile limit
of subdivision jurisdiction and the plans for the subdivision call for the
installation of septic tanks for sanitary disposal or central sewage treatment
facilities, an additional print shall be sent to the Lorain or Erie County
Board of Health or the Lorain or Erie County Sanitary Engineer for report and
approval.
   (b)   After the plan has been reviewed by the City Engineer and other
concerned agencies and the design details and requirements have been
satisfactorily met, it shall be reported back by letter to the Commission.
   (c)   The plan, signed by the City Engineer, together with the signature of
the Director of Public Service regarding the improvements, shall be transmitted
to the Commission.
   (d)   After final approval by the Commission, the plan shall be signed by
the Chairman and returned to the City Engineer.
   (e)   The City Engineer shall have a mylar tracing made of the final plan.
The cost of the plan shall be charged against the fund deposited by the
subdivider. The original tracing shall be recorded by the City Engineer.
   (f)   Before any subdivision plat or construction plan is given final
approval, the subdivider or developer shall have executed a subdivider's
agreement with the City of Vermilion or any other applicable city or county
department, acting through the City Engineer as its agent.
   (g)   A performance bond for the amount of the construction and inspection
costs as estimated by the City Engineer shall be deposited with the Clerk of
Council before authorization of any construction. In lieu of the performance
bond, a certified check in the amount of ninety percent of the estimated
construction cost shall be accepted. Upon final approval of the construction
plans, four sets of prints shall be required for the use of the City Engineer.
      (Ord. 79-20. Passed 8-6-79.)
   1250.02  CHARGES FOR REVIEW OF ENGINEERING DETAILS AND FIELD INSPECTION.
   (a)   In compliance with the rules and regulations of the Planning
Commission, it is established that the charge against any private improvement
project shall be based on the actual time spent in review of such plans and
inspection services provided during construction, as determined from the time
records of the Engineer. Costs are to be computed on the basis of the rates on
file with the Clerk of Council.
 
   (b)   The subdivider, or his agent, is required to deposit with the Building
Department a sum of money, in an amount to be determined by the City Engineer
for each application, before a plan will be considered for approval. (Rates
recorded in minutes of the Commission.)
 
   (c)   In the event the subdivider desires to contest the estimate of costs
submitted by the City Engineer, he may do so by appealing to the Commission
within ten days from the date of the estimate, and the Commission shall make
the final decisions, after having evidence from both sides, at the next
regularly scheduled meeting subsequent to the date of appeal. The appeal shall
be in writing.  (Ord. 2003-18.  Passed 4-7-03.)
   1250.03  CONSTRUCTION PLANS GENERALLY.
   This section is intended to enable a developer or his or her engineer to
prepare his or her construction plans so that the review and approval thereof
will be expedited.
   (a)   Developers of subdivisions are required to indicate on the drawing the
engineering details of all existing and proposed facilities and services, which
include street pavements, sidewalks, sanitary and storm sewers, water and gas
mains and street lighting facilities. Such facilities and services shall be
designed by an engineer who must be a registered professional engineer in the
State. The  State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, Construction and
Material Specifications, January 1, 1975, edition, as amended, and the Division
of Highways, Bureau of Roadway Design, Standard Construction Drawing, as
amended by Council, shall be followed, except where they specifically deviate
from other ordinances duly enacted by the City. The location of public
utilities and specifically street lighting facilities shall initially be
planned and cooperatively agreed upon among the City Engineer, the Planning
Commission and the developer. As a part of the required public improvement
facilities within a subdivision, the subdivider, in areas where overhead
utilities are permitted, shall cause to be planned street lighting facilities
within the public right of way and shall submit drawings to the City Engineer
in such form as can be forwarded to the electric utility company in order that
such company can plan, locate and install street lighting facilities. No street
lighting post, pole or pedestal shall be installed or illuminated until the
City Engineer orders the same pursuant to the approved plan therefor. While it
is not the obligation of the subdivider to pay for such facilities, the
subdivider is obligated to cause the street lighting facilities to be planned
in a manner acceptable to the City Engineer. Where underground utilities are
required henceforth, the subdivider shall cause to be planned and shall pay for
hollow core pole lighting facilities within the dedicated right of way and
shall submit drawings to the City Engineer in such form as can be forwarded to
the electric utility company in order that such company can plan, locate and
install street lighting facilities. No street lighting post, pole or pedestal
shall be installed or illuminated until the City Engineer orders the same
pursuant to the approved plan therefor. Such hollow core street lighting
facilities shall be included as a required subdivision improvement, the expense
of which shall be borne by the subdivider. Such facilities shall be planned
prior to the final acceptance of such subdivision and its improvements by
Council, but shall not be a cause to delay the subdivider at preliminary stages
so long as adequate drawings and plans have been submitted to the City Engineer
upon which he or she and the electric utility company can locate street
lighting facilities. The subdivider shall grant to the electric utility company
any easements necessary for the installation, operation and maintenance of such
street lighting facilities. (Ord. 86-14. Passed 6-2-86.)
   (b)   Each plat or plan, when filed with public authorities for review and
approval, shall bear the stamp or the seal prescribed by the State Board of
Registration for Professional Engineers and Surveyors. Plans not bearing such
stamp shall not be given consideration.

   (Ord. 87-15.  Passed 5-18-87.)
   1250.12  EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL FOR SEWERS AND WATER MAINS.
   These specifications for excavation and backfill are minimum requirements
and will cover most work in general. Special requirements for unusual
conditions shall be agreed upon at the time of submitting detail plans and
specifications.
   (a)   Trench Excavation. The trench excavation for both sewer and water pipe
bedding shall be true to line and grade, as shown on the plans. The banks of
the trench shall be kept as nearly vertical as possible and shall be properly
drained. The bottom of the trenches shall not be more than twenty-four inches
wider than the outside diameter of the pipe, with a minimum clearance between
the bottom of the pipe and the trench bottom of one-fourth of the pipe diameter
(but not less than six inches) in order that the pipe may be bedded in No. 8 or
304 stone or slag as described in backfill subsections (g), (h) or (i) hereof.
Shale, ledge rock, boulders and large stones shall be removed from the trench
to give a minimum clearance from pipe or fittings of six inches.
      (Ord. 76-5. Passed 2-2-76.)
   (b)   Unstable Ground. Wherever wet, unstable or other undesirable soil is
encountered which does not provide proper bearing for pipe, such material shall
be excavated to good ground and the excavation refilled with suitable material
to the required subgrade, compacting the fill in six-inch layers. If it would
be more economical and desirable, soft ground may be crossed by supporting the
pine on concrete cradles, poured to cover the lower quadrant of the pipe. In no
case shall any pipe or appurtenances be laid in or on topsoil.
   (c)   Unauthorized Excavation. Wherever excavation in good ground has been
carried below the established grade for installation of the piping, such
excavated space shall be refilled with suitable material, as approved by the
City Engineer, to the required subgrade, compacting the fill in six-inch
layers.
   (d)   Sheeting, Shoring and Bracing. All excavation shall be adequately
protected from caving. If such caving occurs and disturbs the bedding, the
grade or the alignment of the piping, the work shall be removed, suitable
sheeting, shoring and bracing provided, and the work reinstalled. 
      The sheeting and bracing, in general, shall be removed as backfilling
progresses and in such a manner as to avoid caving of the trench. Voids left by
the withdrawal of sheeting shall be carefully filled and tamped.
   (e)   Excavation Under Railroad Tracks. Excavation under railroad tracks
shall be determined separately for each individual crossing and shall be shown
on the plans and described in the specifications.
   (f)   Tunnel Excavations. Where the excavation crosses main highways or
railroad tracks, tunneling may be permitted where depth of trench and soil
conditions are adequate. All tunnel backfill shall be of proper moisture
content to compact readily and shall be thoroughly tamped and rammed under,
around and over the pipe from the floor of the tunnel to the sidewalls and top
thereof. Where tunneling is to be used, the method and details shall be shown
in the plans and specifications.
      (Ord. 850. Passed 7-1-63.)
   (g)   Backfill for Water Mains. After the piping has been laid to line and
grade, trenches shall be backfllled with No. 8 or 304 limestone, carefully
deposited under and on both sides of the pipe, thoroughly and carefully rammed
by hand tamping methods until such fill has been brought to the center line of
pipe. Then, fine, loose earth shall be placed and thoroughly and carefully
rammed by hand tamping methods until such fill has been brought to six inches
above the pipe. This portion of the backfill shall be carefully placed and
thoroughly compacted until a firm and continuous support on the bottom and
sides is secured.
      Where the trench is excavated through cinder fill or other material
which, in the opinion of the inspector, is not suitable for backfill, suitable
material for backfilling shall be hauled to the site. The remainder of the
trench may then be backfilled by hand or mechanical equipment. Water settling
may be permitted if it is possible to do so without floating the pipe.
   (h)   Backfill for Sanitary Sewers. After sewer piping has been approved for
line and grade, trenches shall be backfilled with No. 8 or 304 limestone or
slag, carefully deposited under and around the pipe, thoroughly and carefully
rammed by hand tamping methods until enough limestone or slag fill has been
placed to provide a cover of at least six inches above the top of the pipe.
This backfill shall provide a firm and continuous support on the bottom and
sides of the pipe.
      The remainder of the backfill shall consist of material previously
excavated and may be placed by hand or mechanical equipment. Water settling
will be permitted, providing floating of the pipe does not occur.
   (i)   Backfill for Storm Sewers. After sewer piping has been approved for
line and grade, trenches shall be backfilled with No. 8 or 304 limestone or
slag, carefully deposited under and around the pipe, thoroughly and carefully
rammed by hand tamping methods until enough limestone or slag fill has been
placed to extend up around the pipe a distance from the bottom of the pipe
shown in the minimum bedding depth table as follows:
Minimum Bedding Depth for Pipe
 
Internal Diameter (Inches) Bedding Depth (Inches)

60                         13
   (j)   Backfill in Paved Areas. Wherever trenches occur in existing roadways
and paved areas, the backfill shall consist of No. 8 or 304 stone. It shall be
thoroughly compacted in six-inch layers, or puddled with hose and long nozzles,
after the backfill is in place. When the area is to be paved with asphalt, the
top eight inches of the backfill shall consist of crushed slag or limestone to
match the existing road base and shall then be paved to match existing road or
paved area. For all concrete pavement, the concrete must project at least one
foot beyond the trench sides.
      Wherever trenches occur in future paved areas, the backfill shall be as
per the foregoing paragraph or in accordance with subsection (g), (h) or (i)
hereof if left unpaved for a period of at least six months after completion of
the backfill.

(Ord. 76-5. Passed 2-2-76.)
   1250.16   TESTING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   Sanitary Sewerage and Water Lines. Field tests shall be conducted
before the systems are placed in service by the City Engineer. The tests shall
be performed as specified herein, in the presence of a representative of the
City Engineer. Preliminary tests and repair or correction of all faulty work
shall be completed before calling the representative to observe the test for
acceptance.
   Disposal of testing media must be done with full consideration to flooding
or damage to the piping, other installations, adjoining property and safety of
personnel.
(1)   Testing equipment. All necessary apparatus and equipment required for
testing, including pumps, barrels, gauges, mirrors, temporary lines and
fittings, shall be furnished by the person or persons constructing the sanitary
sewers, water mains and/or appurtenances thereto.
(2)   Water lines. The piping shall be tested hydrostatically and permissible
leakage shall be as specified in the AWWA Standard which is evaluated for a
pressure basis of 150 psi. Permissible leakage shall not be more than thirty
U.S. gallons per twenty-four hours per mile of pipe per inch of nominal
diameter of pipe.
   The City water piping shall be thoroughly sterilized with chlorine and
flushed before it is placed in operation. The chlorinating materials shall be
introduced to the City water piping under the direction of the City Engineer.
Following a contact period of not less than twenty-four hours, the piping shall
be flushed with clean water until the residual chlorine content is not greater
than two-tenths ppm. Tests for efficacy of sterilization shall be made by the
City and repeated sterilization shall be performed by those installing the work
as required.
(3)   Sanitary sewerage. All sewers shall be constructed and so jointed that
infiltration of water into, or leakage of sewage therefrom, shall not be
greater than hereinafter specified when subjected to the following leakage
test:
After sewers, or sections thereof, have been constructed and the backfilling
has been sufficiently completed to prevent flotation of the pipe, and at times
and locations selected by the City Engineer, sections of the sewer shall be
isolated and the test shall be made by plugging the downgrade end of the
section to be tested and a temporarily installed curve, or other fitting, shall
be used at the other end so that the station to be tested can be filled with
water with four feet of head at the upper end for a period of one hour.
The four feet of head shall be measured above the crown of the pipe, and in
cases where the ground water table is higher than the sewer, the four feet of
head shall be measured above the water table.
These isolated sections of sewer shall be from manhole to manhole in order to
test only the sewer pipe, and the maximum rate of exfiltration shall be 100
gallons per inch of diameter of pipe per twenty-four hours per mile of pipe.
Manholes shall be plugged and tested separately. The maximum ground water
infiltration for a manhole four feet in diameter shall be 0.291 gallons per
vertical foot per hour.
      Before the leakage test, the sewer shall be subject to a test for grade,
line and cleanliness. The City Engineer may require that the interior of the
sewer be photographed or examined by television at the expense of the
subdivider.
   All obstructions found in the sewer shall be removed and irregularities in
line and grade shall be straightened.
   (b)   Concrete Pavement. Compression test cylinders shall be made by the
inspector each day. If further tests are deemed necessary by the City Engineer,
he shall so direct that these be made in addition to the compression tests. If
the cylinders do not show the required compressive strength is attained,
borings of the pavement shall be required, and if these show the pavement to
have less than the required compressive strength, the pavement shall be removed
and replaced.

condition determined necessary for approval, the copy shall be retained by the
Commission and filed with the records of the City, and the other returned to
the applicant.

protect and encourage the agricultural use of the land in appropriate areas, to
provide for those uses which require large land areas and which are compatible
with or supplement agriculture, to maintain lower residential densities in
those areas less suited to urban development and to avoid the costly extension
of public services to such areas.

(Ord. 98-87.  Passed 3-1-99.)

half stories or thirty-five feet in height. No other building shall exceed

of occupancy to the City Planning Commission for study and report to the Board
of Zoning Appeals. Upon receiving the report from the City Planning Commission,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve or deny the issuance of the building
permit or shall negotiate with the applicant for such proposed changes in the
construction, use, storage, handling of materials or other matter which the
Board may deem necessary in the best interests of the City. Upon reaching
agreement with the applicant on such matters, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
issue the building permit to the applicant.
   A change or changes in the physical facilities or use permitted by a
building permit shall occur only after the holder of such has obtained an
amendment thereto allowing such change or changes.
   A certificate of occupancy for a building or use of land in this District
may not be issued until the Administrative Officer finds that all of the
provisions of this chapter have been met. Such certificate may be revoked by
the Board of Zoning Appeals after hearing if the Board finds that the holder of
the certificate has failed to comply with the development of approved plans.

in any Industrial Park District shall meet City standards. As a condition
precedent to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, streets, sewers and
water lines shall be installed or performance guaranteed in an approved manner
and at grades and locations in street abutting lot lines as approved by the

utilized initially, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall authorize the
postponement, until further improvements are to be made, of as much of the
installation of streets, sewers and water lines and other improvements as is
reasonable under the circumstances of the use to be made of the plot and the
drainage and traffic problems of the area.

public health, safety and welfare by providing for the regulation of Planned
Unit Developments. It is the intent of these regulations to provide maximum
opportunity for orderly developments which will benefit the community as a
whole by offering a greater choice of living environments, a complementary
blending of land uses, to include community facilities and open space, and a
more unified approach with respect to the mixture of uses and their adaptation
to topographical and geological features, recreational opportunities and
transportation needs.
 
   (c)   Planned Unit Development Defined.  "Planned Unit Development" or "PUD"
shall mean a development which may integrate residential, commercial and
industrial facilities in a preplanned environment under more flexible
standards, such as lot sizes and setbacks, than those restrictions that would
normally apply under these regulations. The procedure for approval of such
development contains additional requirements such as building design principles
and landscaping plans.

appear to be in conflict with other sections of this Zoning Code or with those
of other existing ordinances, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
 
   (e)   District Designation.  Subsequent to the approval of the Vermilion
City Council as hereinafter set forth, the designation “Planned Unit
Development District” may be applied to any residential, commercial or
industrial developments.  Upon approval of the zoning development plan, the
Official Zoning Map shall be so amended.  The designation shall only apply to
property at the election of the property owner.
 
   (f)   Permitted Uses.  Residential, commercial, manufacturing public and
quasi-public uses may be separate or combined in PUD Districts, provided that
the proposed uses will not adversely impact upon adjacent property or the
public health, safety and general welfare and that the location of uses in the
PUD is specified in the final development plan. The PUD may be comprised of one
use or a combination of uses, as indicated above. There is no minimum area
required for a PUD.
   The amount of land devoted to a commercial and/or manufacturing use in a
residential-commercial-manufacturing or residential-commercial development
shall be determined by the Commission and approved by the Vermilion City
Council.
   (g)   Disposition of Open Space.  The required amount of common open space
land reserved under a PUD shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners
of the project area, for the use of each owner who buys property within the
development, or be dedicated to a property owners' association, who shall have
title to the land, which shall be retained as common open space for parks,
recreation and related uses. The articles of incorporation creating the
organization of the property owners' association are subject to review and
approval by the Law Director and shall provide adequate provisions for the
perpetual care and maintenance of all common areas. Public utility and similar
easements and rights-of-way for water courses and other similar channels are
not acceptable for common open space dedication unless such land or right-of-
way is usable as a trail or similar purpose and has been approved by the
Commission. The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall be
specified by the developer before approval of the final development.
   The Vermilion Planning Commission shall recommend to Vermilion City Council
the amount of five percent of the land included in the PUD to be conveyed to
the City for park purposes. In lieu of the conveyance, the Planning Commission
may recommend to City Council that the subdivider pay cash. The amount of
payment shall be delineated in the subdivider/developer agreement presented to
Vermilion City Council.
   (h)   Utility Requirements.  Utilities, including telephone, cable
television and electrical systems, are required to be installed underground
within the limits of all PUD's. Appurtenances to these systems which can be
effectively screened may be exempt from this requirement if the Commission
finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the
proposed PUD.
 
   (i)   Special Lot Requirements.  The final density of areas to be included
in a PUD approved by the Planning Commission shall not exceed those currently
permitted by the existing Planning and Zoning Code of the City of Vermilion of
that parcel.
 
   (j)   Arrangement of Commercial/Manufacturing Uses. When PUD Districts
include commercial and/or industrial uses, buildings shall be planned as groups
having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections with
streets. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of the
commercial and/or manufacturing areas. The plan of the project shall provide
for the integrated and harmonious design of buildings and for adequate and
properly arranged facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping and
such other features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project
attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding
areas.
   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner as specified by the Commission.
 
   (k)   Approval Procedures.  Planned Unit Development Districts shall be
approved in accordance with the procedure set forth in subsection (m) hereof.
The designation of PUD's will be considered a change of zoning and must meet
all the applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
 
   (l)   Pre-Application Meeting.  The developer shall meet with the Building
Inspector and the City Engineer prior to the submission of the conceptual
development plan.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early and
informally the purpose and effect of this section and the criteria standards
contained herein and to familiarize the developer with zoning and other
applicable regulations.
   (m)   Preliminary Development Plan Application Requirements.  An application
for preliminary PUD approval shall be filed with the Building Inspector by at
least one owner of property for which the PUD is proposed.  The procedure for
approval shall be the same as an amendment to this Zoning Code, as detailed in
subsection (t) hereof.  The filing of a conceptual development plan under this
section shall constitute the election by the property owner to submit the
property described in the plan to provisions of this chapter and shall
constitute an application for rezoning the property to the PUD District.  All
plans prepared and submitted must be prepared by a registered engineer,
surveyor or architect.  At a minimum, the application shall contain the
following information filed in triplicate:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of the applicant;

the City Engineer may require;
      (8)   A conceptual development plan submitted to the City with one
drawing being a minimum size of 24" x 36" and the overall plans should be
scaled at a maximum of one inch equals 100 feet showing the general location
and type of residential, commercial and industrial land uses, the layout and
dimensions and names of existing and proposed streets, rights-of-way, utility
easements, parks and community spaces; the layout and dimensions of lots and
building setback lines, general location of buildings, and such other
characteristics as the Commission may deem necessary;
        (9)   Proposed schedule for the development of the site;
      (10)   Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the land
in question to initiate the proposed development plan within two years;

property within 300 feet of the property in question; and
      (13)   Verification by at least one owner of the property that all
information in the application is true and correct to the best of his or her
knowledge.  The application for a conceptual PUD shall be accompanied by a
written statement by the developer setting forth the reasons why, in his or her
opinion, the PUD would be in the public interest and would be consistent with
the stated intent of these PUD requirements.
   The application for a preliminary PUD shall be accompanied by a written
statement by the developer setting forth the reasons why, in his or her
opinion, the PUD would be in the public interest and would be consistent with
the stated intent of these PUD requirements.
   (n)   Criteria for Commission Recommendation. Before making its
recommendation, the Commission shall find that the facts submitted with the
application and presented at the public hearing establish that:
(1)   The proposed development can be initiated within two years of the date of
approval.
(2)   The streets proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated
traffic and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as to
overload the street network outside the PUD.
(3)   Any proposed commercial or industrial development can be justified at the
location proposed.
(4)   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by design
and other amenities incorporated in the development plan, in accordance with
these PUD requirements and the need to provide a variety of housing
opportunities with regard to type and price.
(5)   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
(6)   Proposed design shall consider the removal of minimal natural coverage
and in all cases reflect conservatory measures relating to open space.
(7)   The PUD will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses.
(8)   The PUD will be a substantial improvement to property in the immediate
vicinity and to the community as a whole.
(9)   The PUD will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal or schools, or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such service.
(10)   The PUD will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment or conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons,
property or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors. The Planning Commission may require
studies, such as a traffic study, to be provided to ensure the concerns noted
above can be addressed.
(11)   The PUD will encourage development as close as possible to existing
settlements to keep the cost of providing service down.
(12)   The PUD will provide adequate access for emergency vehicles and for
those persons providing emergency services.
(13)   The PUD will provide adequate security lighting for pedestrian
circulation paths, vehicular use areas and exterior portions of buildings.
(14)   The design of the PUD will encourage the use of the existing road system
presently maintained by the authority having jurisdiction to minimize the
additional maintenance expense of new development and to ensure that new
development is adequately served by the transportation network.
(15)   The PUD will be consistent with the intent and purposes of this section.
   (o)   Development Policies.
(1)   Density.
         A.   The maximum density for a proposed residential development shall
be based on site specific review and on the compatibility with adjacent uses.
         B.   Where increased densities are located adjacent to existing
buildings, the building setback must be increased to minimize any adverse
impact of the proposed development.
(2)   Height criteria.
         A.   Architectural compatibility. The heights of all buildings must be
compatible with their vicinity.
         B.   General character. The heights of the buildings should be in
general compliance with district regulations for a similar type of land use.
         C.   Scenic values. Buildings should be of such heights so as not to
destroy or degrade the scenic values of the surrounding area.
         D.   Light and air. Buildings shall not be of such heights so as to
deny light and air to surrounding properties.
   (p)   Site Design.  The City hereby finds that it is in the public interest
for all sites within the community to be designed, arranged and developed in a
safe, efficient and aesthetically pleasing manner. The arrangement of all
functions, uses and improvements should reflect the natural capabilities and
limitations of the adjacent property. The various structures, use areas,
functions and elements of the site should be integrated by design into a
unified whole, except in those cases where separation is appropriate to a
particular interrelationship. Taking into consideration the basic character of
the site and the nature of the proposed uses, the development should be
visually harmonious as perceived from both within and without.
(1)   Integration and separation.  It is encouraged that those elements and
functions of a site that are basically compatible with one another be
integrated by design to the degree of their compatibility and separated to the
degree of their incompatibility.
(2)   Privacy.  It is encouraged that all sites be arranged so as to provide
privacy for the occupants of both the site and surrounding areas.
(3)   Aesthetics. It is recommended that the site be developed in such a way so
as to be visually harmonious when viewed either internally or externally.
(4)   Vistas. It is encouraged that the site be developed in such a way so as
to preserve or enhance vistas, particularly those seen from public places.
   (q)   Placement of Structures.
(1)   Clear vision area. No structure or foliage shall extend into a clear
vision area between the height of three feet and seven feet measured from the
top of the curb, or where no curb exists, from the established street center
line grade. The clear vision areas shall be as follows:
         A.   Intersection or driveways and public rights-of-way. A triangle
having two sides ten feet long and running along the driveway and public right-
of-way, said length beginning at their intersection and the third side formed
by a line connecting the two ends.
         B.   Intersection of two public rights-of-way. A triangle having two
sides thirty feet long and running along each public right-of-way, said length
beginning at their intersection and the third side formed by a line connecting
the two sides.
(2)   Placement of Structures.
         A.   Adverse effects. No structure shall be placed in such a way so as
to adversely affect adjacent ownerships. Adverse effects shall include, but not
be limited to, the removal of lateral support, the creation of hazard,
nuisance, danger or inconvenience, unreasonable loss of light and air, or loss
of privacy.
         B.   Snow storage areas. Buildings shall be placed in such a manner as
to allow access to public rights-of-way. Snow storage easements shall be
dedicated where appropriate.
   (r)   Amendment Procedure.  Upon receipt of a conceptual development plan
which complies with the provisions of this section, the Vermilion Planning
Commission shall follow established guidelines pursuant to Sections
1266.03 through
1266.07 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Vermilion.
   (s)   Submission of Zoning  Development Plan.  After approval of the
conceptual development plan in accordance with the provisions of this chapter,
the developer shall submit a zoning development plan to the Building
Inspector.  The zoning development plan shall be in general conformance with
the conceptual development plan.  Eight copies of the zoning development plan
shall be submitted to the Building Inspector.  Two copies shall be forwarded to
the City Engineer for his or her review and comments.  Copies will be forwarded
from the City Engineer to the applicable agencies for comments.
   (t)   Zoning Development Plan Application Contents.  An application for
approval of the zoning development plan shall be filed with the Building
Inspector by at least one owner of property for which the PUD is proposed. 
Each application shall be signed by the owner, attesting the truth and
exactness of all information supplied on the application for the zoning
development plan.  Each application shall clearly state that the approval shall
expire and may be revoked if construction on the project has not begun within
two years from the date of issuance of the approval.  At a minimum, the
application shall contain the following information:
      (1)   A survey of the proposed development site, showing the dimensions
and bearing of the property lines, area in acres, topography, and existing
features of the development site, including major wooded areas, structures,
streets, easements, utility lines and land uses.
      (2)   All the information required on the conceptual development plan;

standards for height, open space, building density, parking areas, population
density and public improvement, whenever the applicant proposes any exception
from standard zoning district requirements or other resolutions governing
development.
      (4)   A signed declaration from the applicant and registered project
engineer acknowledging receipt of the City of Vermilion codified ordinances and
standards regarding the construction of necessary water, sewer, drainage,
electricity, telephone and natural gas installations; waste disposal
facilities; street improvements; and the nature and extent of earth work
required for site preparation and development.  The aforementioned declaration
must include a statement of certification that all future improvements and

fifty dollars ($250.00).  Other fees are regulated under Section
1242.07.
   (u)   Action by Vermilion City Council.  The Vermilion City Council shall
either approve, approve with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the zoning
plan as submitted and recommended by the Vermilion Planning Commission.  If the
application is approved as submitted  or approved with conditions, the
Vermilion City Council shall direct the Building Inspector to issue zoning
permits in accordance with the approved plan and any conditions thereto
attached.  The zoning development plan shall further be considered as an
integral part of the rezoning amendment and, except as provided in paragraph
(x)(2) hereof, no change from or substantive alteration in such PUD shall be
permitted without repetition of the procedures in these sections.
   (v)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards.  In approving any PUD
application, the Vermilion City Council may prescribe appropriate conditions
and safeguards in conformity with this section. Any violation of such
conditions or safeguards, which have been made part of the terms under which
the final development plan has been approved, shall constitute a violation of
this section and be punishable as such.
   (w)   After approval of the zoning development plan for a PUD District, no
person, firm or corporation proposing to lay out or have laid out, within the
territorial jurisdiction of these Regulations, a Planned Unit Development,
shall proceed with any construction work on the proposed subdivision, including
grading, before obtaining from the Commission the approval of the preliminary
plan of the proposed subdivision, as required by Chapter
1244 - Procedure of Subdivision Approval Generally of the Codified Ordinances
of Vermilion.  The applicant is permitted but not required to make application
under Chapter
1244 of the Codified Ordinances of Vermilion concurrently with submission of
conceptual development plan but any approval of such submission is also
contingent upon final approval of the PUD zoning development plan and zoning
change of the Vermilion City Council.
   (x)   Expiration and Extension of Approval Period.  The approval of a zoning
development plan for a PUD District shall be for a period not to exceed two
years to allow for preparation and recording of the required subdivision plat
and development of the project.  An extension of the time limit or modification
of the approved zoning development plan may be approved if the Vermilion City
Council finds that such extension is not in conflict with the public interest. 
No zoning amendment passed during the time period granted for the approved
final zoning development plan shall in any way affect the terms under which
approval of the PUD was granted.
   (y)   Changes in the Planned Unit Development.  A PUD shall be developed
only according to the approved and recorded zoning plan and all supporting
data.  The recorded zoning plan and supporting data, together with all recorded
amendments, shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and
assigns, and shall limit and control the uses of premises (including the
internal use of buildings and structures) and the location of structures in the
PUD, as set forth therein.
      (1)   Major changes.  Changes which alter the concept or intent of the
PUD,  including increases in the density, changes in the location and types of
nonresidential land uses, increases in the height of buildings, reductions of
proposed open space, more than a zero percent modification in proportion of
housing types, changes in road standards or alignment, utilities, water,
electricity and drainage, or changes in the final governing agreements,
provisions or covenants, and a fifteen percent decrease in density, may be
approved only by submission of a new conceptual plan and supporting data and
following the conceptual approval steps and subsequent amendment of the zoning
PUD plan.
      (2)   Minor changes.  The Building Inspector and the City Engineer may
approve changes in the PUD which do not change the concept or intent of the
development, without going through the conceptual approval steps, and if
approved by the Vermilion Planning Commission.

   1271.00 STANDARDS FOR HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   The purpose of the Home Occupation regulations is to protect the character
of the surrounding residential neighborhood while recognizing that traditional
workplaces are no longer necessary in all situations due to changing
technology, computerization, networking, and the changing job market. These
regulations are intended to recognize this trend and allow Home Occupations
that are located and conducted in such a manner that the existence of the Home
Occupation is not detectable outside of the dwelling unit or accessory
building. The Home Occupation use shall be clearly subordinate and incidental
to the residential use of the property.
   (a)    Classes of Home Occupation.
      (1)   Minor Home Occupations. Home occupations that have little or no
impact on the surrounding residential area as follows:

noticeable impact on the surrounding residential area. Examples include:
         A.    Day care for seven (7) or more individuals, whether adults or
children.
         B.    Professional services including (but not limited to) medical,
dental or physical therapy facilities, barbers, beauticians, and photographers.
         C.   Bed-and-breakfast residence.
   (b)   Standards for Minor Home Occupations.
      (1)    Clients or customers will not be present on the site on a
regularly scheduled basis and shall not exceed ten (10) per week on average
except that instructional services are limited to a maximum of five (5)
students at any one time in one day.
      (2)    No signage identifying the minor home occupation is permitted in a
residential district.
      (3)    Retail sales on the premises shall be prohibited, except for
products or goods produced or fabricated on the premises as part of the home
occupation.
      (4)    No minor home occupation shall have more than one (1) employee
that is not a resident of the household, except that, upon notification of the
City Chief Building Official, there may be a second employee who is not a
resident of the household on the site for up to thirty (30) days per year.
   (c)    Standards for Major Home Occupations.
      (I)    If the major home occupation is day care for children, 100 square
feet of fenced outdoor play space is required per child. The play area must be
at the side or rear of the house and a drop-off area for two (2) cars must be
provided.
      (2)    Signage as permitted pursuant to Section
1274.11.
      (3)    Two (2) off-street parking spaces shall be provided, unless
additional spaces are required by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Required parking
shall not be provided in the front yard, except for the driveway (which may be
used to fulfill this requirement).
      (4)    On-site customer/client contact is limited to one appointment at
any time not to exceed eight (8) visits per day, except day care facilities,
which may have more than eight (8), if approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (5)    One truck or van over one ton may be stored on-site, if related to
the home occupation and if stored in an enclosed structure.
      (6)    Major home occupations are permitted two (2) employees who are not
residents of the household and may have additional employees who are not
residents of the household, if approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

      (Ord. 99-46.  Passed 10-24-99.)
 
   1275.03   TOWERS.
   (a)   Location Criteria.  Wireless telecommunications facilities, towers,
and related structures may be located in any zoning district, as established by
Chapter
1268 and as defined in Chapter
1270 of this Planning and Zoning Code, and located according to the Official
Zoning Map, as a conditional use per Section
1280.10. Generally, wireless telecommunications towers are objectionable in
residential areas because their use is industrial in nature, and may be
objectionable in the community at large because they are frequently
considerably taller that surrounding structures, causing them to be seen from
long distances. Their location is therefore regulated as permitted by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time to time be amended. Prior to
approval, the provider shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that
if towers and related wireless telecommunications facilities are located in the
City of Vermilion, they shall not adversely affect the natural or man-made
environment or the architectural setting, and that their location shall not
pose a reasonable risk to the health and safety of residents.
(1)   Priority. In order to accommodate the communications needs of residents
and businesses while protecting the health, safety, and general welfare, the
City of Vermilion recommends and encourages the placement of wireless
telecommunications facilities and towers in non-residential areas, in the
following order of preference:
         A.   City-owned property.
         B.   Industrial areas.
         C.   Quasi-public areas.
         D.   Business districts, excluding the Harbour Town Historic District,
as outlined in paragraph (a)(10) hereof.
         E.   Other non-residential districts deemed appropriate by review of
the Planning Commission and approval of City Council.
(2)   Sole use on a lot. A wireless telecommunications tower and related
facilities are permitted as the sole use on a lot, and may be permitted, by
approval of the Planning Commission, on lots containing other uses where
existing structures enable co-usage, including on City-owned property.
(3)   Placement in residential zoning districts. In order to locate wireless
telecommunications towers and related facilities in residential zoning
districts, the applicant service provider shall demonstrate to the Planning
Commission that there is sound technical and geographic reasons for doing so,
such as: (i) written verification that offers to co-locate with other providers
or placement as a co-usage with other structures within Vermilion or
neighboring communities have proven ineffective, or (ii) evidence that, in
order to provide wireless telecommunications services to the residents and
businesses in a manner that serves their best interests, such towers and
facilities may only be placed in a residential zoning district.
(4)   Co-location and co-usage. In residential zoning districts, co-location
and co-usage shall be explored as the primary means of locating towers and/or
antennas. When a wireless telecommunications facility is located in conformity
with this chapter, and the antenna(s) is (are) placed as a co-usage and is
(are) attached to an institutional, recreational, public utility, office,
industrial, or commercial structure or building, equipment and apparatus
supporting a facility shall be stored on the premises inside the wireless
telecommunications equipment building or other structure on the premises of the
facility.
(5)   Setbacks. For purposes of this chapter only, any provision of this
Planning and Zoning Code notwithstanding, the setback for a tower of any
variety, including monopole, shall be measured from the base of the tower at
the point where it is placed in the ground to the property line. The exception
to this regulation is when a tower or antenna is placed or affixed as a co-
usage, in which case the setback shall be measured from the base of the tower
or antenna at the point where it is placed on the existing structure to the
property line.
         A.   An equipment building and all other structures, except the tower,
shall be set back the minimum distance required in the zoning district.
         B.   Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)D. and E. hereof, in
industrial zoning districts, the setback for the tower shall be at least fifty
percent of the total height of the tower.  A minimum of seventy-five feet shall
be required.
         C.   Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)D. and E. hereof, in non-
industrial zoning districts, the setback for the tower shall be seventy-five
percent of the total height of the tower.  A minimum of seventy-five feet shall
be required.
         D.   In any zoning district where the lot on which a tower is located
abuts another lot on which is located a school of any type, including
institutions of higher learning beyond high school level, public or private
parks (but not including golf courses), hospitals, playgrounds, day care
centers, health centers, or other human services and educational uses, the
setback for a tower shall be equal to the total height of the tower.
         E.   In any zoning district where a lot on which a tower is located
abuts any lot within a residential zoning district of any classification, the
setback for a tower shall be equal to the total height of the tower.
         F.   Guy wires may be anchored within the required setback area only
if the tower itself is placed in conformity with this chapter regarding
setbacks, but guy wires and other similar supporting devices shall be not less
than ten feet from any adjoining lot, regardless of the underlying zoning
district.
(6)   Amateur radio towers. Towers supporting amateur radio antennas and
conforming to all applicable provisions of this chapter shall be permitted in
residential zoning districts, but not as a sole use of a lot, and only in the
rear yard of such parcels, as defined in this Planning and Zoning Code.
(7)   Government placement. The City of Vermilion and any other governmental
entity may locate wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities in
residential zoning districts, even as the sole use of the lot, but only on
publicly owned property. The City of Vermilion may contract with private
wireless telecommunications service providers to locate a tower and related
facilities on City-owned property in residential zoning districts, provided
that all provisions of this chapter are followed.
(8)   Open space. Wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities are
permitted on land which has been established as permanent open space or a park,
subject to the following conditions:
         A.   In order to locate wireless telecommunications towers and related
facilities in permanent open space or park lands, the applicant/service
provider shall demonstrate to the Planning Commission that there is sound
technical and geographic reasons for doing so, such as: (i) written
verification that offers to co-locate with other providers or placement as a
co-usage with other structures within Vermilion or neighboring communities have
proven ineffective, or (ii) evidence that, in order to provide wireless
telecommunications services to the residents and businesses in a manner that
serves their best interests, such towers and facilities may only be placed in
open space or in park lands.
         B.   The open space shall be owned and overseen by the City of
Vermilion, Lorain and Erie Counties, the State of Ohio, the United States of
America, other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, a private
homeowners association, or a private, non-profit conservation organization.
         C.   In permanent open space or park lands, all towers shall be
camouflaged using the best and most advanced techniques possible, pursuant to
paragraph (c)(5) hereof. This provision cannot be waived by the Planning
Commission.
         D.   Other setback provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the
tower shall be set back a minimum of 200 feet from any single family
residential zoning district, as defined per Chapters
1268 and
1270 of this Planning and Zoning Code.
(9)   Subordinate to surrounding uses. Towers and related wireless
telecommunications facilities shall be placed, constructed, and modified
subordinate and in deference to the use of private, residentially zoned or used
property, by minimizing the visual effect on adjoining and vicinity residential
properties, and to minimize the visual, often unattractive, impact towers and
related wireless telecommunications facilities create when viewing them from a
distance.
  (10)   Harbour Town Historic District. Wireless telecommunications towers and
related facilities shall be prohibited from locating within the Harbour Town
Historic District as defined in Section
 1224.01 of this Planning and Zoning Code, except as a co-usage with existing
facilities and structures. As it is in the interest of the residents of the
City of Vermilion to preserve and protect the valuable historic buildings,
neighborhoods, and authenticity of the Harbour Town Historic District, the
location of a wireless telecommunications tower of any variety, as a sole use
on a zoning lot, shall be strictly prohibited. The requirement of co-usage with
existing facilities, such as buildings, water towers, etc., shall be the only
permissible location of wireless telecommunications towers and related
facilities within the boundaries of the Harbour Town Historic District. In the
Harbour Town Historic District, all towers, antennas, and related facilities
shall be camouflaged using the best and most advanced techniques possible,
pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) hereof. This provision cannot be waived by the
Planning Commission.
(11)   Interrelationship of towers and related structures. A tower and its
related wireless telecommunications equipment building and other structures,
landscaping, and other features, if any, shall be located on a single zoning
lot. The provider shall locate a tower and related wireless telecommunications
facilities only on a zoning lot of sufficient dimensions and conditions to
accommodate the overall facility, tower, etc., so that all minimum setbacks and
other zoning requirements of the underlying zoning districts are met.
 
   (b)   Design Criteria.
(1)   Co-location ability. Any wireless telecommunications tower shall be
designed, structurally and electrically, to accommodate both the applicant's
antenna and, at a minimum, comparable antennas for at least two additional
service providers if the tower is at least 100 feet in total height, or for one
additional service provider if the tower is at least thirty feet in total
height. Towers shall be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas
on the tower and to accept antennas mounted at various heights.
(2)   Maximum height. The maximum height of a tower shall not exceed 200 feet,
unless a technically sound and required reason for locating a higher tower is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and the City
Council to be in order, on a case by case basis, by the wireless
telecommunications service provider making the request. Approval for other
similar projects does not necessarily constitute a technically sound and
required reason for subsequent projects; therefore, service providers are
cautioned to develop proof and reasoning independent of other projects. When a
higher tower is required by a provision of law consistent with the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time to time be amended, the
provider shall submit written verification of such fact.  Towers less than 200
feet in height are especially encouraged. Wireless telecommunications towers
higher than 200 feet or located within 2,500 feet of any airport runway, public
or private, shall be registered with the FAA. The provider/operator of such
tower shall submit written verification of such registration with the FAA.
(3)   Underground facilities. Underground wireless telecommunications equipment
buildings are especially encouraged, especially on zoning lots in, or abutting,
residential zoning districts where a tower is placed.
 
   (c)   Aesthetics.
(1)   Landscaping. All towers and related wireless telecommunications
facilities shall be located in a landscaped setting. A landscaped buffer area
of not less than ten feet in depth shall be placed between the wireless
telecommunications facility and the public right-of-way, residential zoning
district, and any adjacent residential use, regardless of the underlying zoning
district thereof. Such buffer area shall, at a minimum, consist of dense
foliage and vegetation, of at least partially evergreen species, not less than
six feet in height. Landscaping shall be continuously maintained and promptly
reconditioned, if necessary. Other landscaping may be required by the Planning
Commission. The arrangement of landscaping and the overall design thereof
within a zoning lot on which a wireless telecommunications tower and related
facility is placed may be considered by the Planning Commission.
(2)   Fencing. Screened fencing shall be provided for appearance, public
safety, and personal security, according to the following requirements:
 
                                            Minimum (in ft.) Maximum (in ft.)
A. Height.  Any residential zoning district3                6
   Any commercial zoning district           3                8
   Any industrial zoning district           3                8
         B.   Type. In any zoning district, the screened fencing shall consist
of a chain link fence, as defined in this Planning and Zoning Code, for the
underlying zoning district. Fencing in an industrial zoning district may be
capped with barbed wire a maximum of twelve inches. The barbed wire portion, if
any, shall be included in the measurement of the total height of such fencing.
         C.   Color. Fencing may be unpainted or painted to blend into the
surrounding area.
         D.   Security. Access to the tower and related wireless
telecommunications facilities shall only be through a locked gate, properly
maintained and secured twenty-four hours per day. The City of Vermilion shall
not be responsible for any damage to the tower or other auxiliary structures,
and shall be held harmless from any liability of any kind relating to damage,
destruction, misfeasance of the tower or auxiliary structures, and from any
personal injury to any party whomever.
(3)   Illumination. Lighting shall be required for that part of towers in
excess of 100 feet, or as otherwise required by the FAA. When such lighting is
required by the FAA or other governmental authority, and the zoning lot on
which a tower is located abuts any residential zoning district, it shall be
oriented inward of the zoning lot and shall not project, or be cast, onto any
or all abutting zoning lots within residential zoning districts. Except as
previously detailed or as required by law or safety factors as determined by
the City of Vermilion, an antenna or tower shall not be illuminated, and
lighting fixtures or signs, other than those sanctioned by this chapter, shall
not be attached to an antenna or tower. Security lighting shall be permitted
for the wireless telecommunications equipment building and other auxiliary
structures, if any.  Any permitted lighting shall be situated and directed so
as not to emit light directly or indirectly onto any adjoining residential
property, and, in any zoning district, such lighting shall be designed, placed,
and directed to minimize its emission and glare onto any adjoining property.
(4)   Signs, symbols/logos, advertising, identification. Identification of
towers and related wireless telecommunications facilities shall be permitted if
required by the FCC, the FAA, the Federal or State EPA, OSHA, or other
governmental agency for regulation or identification purposes, as necessary,
pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time to time be
amended, or other applicable law. The City of Vermilion shall be permitted to
require identification signs. A tower or related wireless telecommunications
facility shall contain no symbols/logos whatever.  The fencing surrounding the
wireless telecommunications equipment building shall contain the appropriate
number of signs to warn the public of danger and, also, at least two signs
stating "NO TRESPASSING", and a sign identifying the wireless
telecommunications service provider, of a type, size, and color as approved by
the Planning Commission. No advertising whatever shall be permitted on towers
or related wireless telecommunications facilities, unless required by law.  All
such signs shall be permanently attached to the tower or other wireless
telecommunications structure and shall be placed at least four feet above
grade. The only colors permitted shall be black, white, red, yellow, orange, or
any combination of these colors.  Signs shall not be illuminated in any manner.
Luminous paint may be used on signs, if approved by the Planning Commission.
(5)   Camouflaging.
         A.   The Planning Commission may require additional landscaping as
part of a camouflage plan. Camouflaging of towers is especially encouraged in
all zoning districts, but shall be required using the most advanced techniques
possible in all residential zoning districts.
           B.   Camouflaging may take the form of erecting a tower which
resembles or mimics another object, such as a tree or flag pole. Camouflaging
may also consist of placing antennas on existing structures such as water
towers or buildings in such a way that they are not easily detected and cannot
be seen by the naked eye from a long distance. Antennas may be placed on trees,
if technically feasible, and if such placement would provide wireless
telecommunications services to the residents and businesses of Vermilion equal
to that if such antennas were placed on towers. If antennas are placed on
trees, they shall be camouflaged.
           C.   A building or other structure may be a prop only, that is,
unused and unusable as anything but a device to camouflage an antenna. It shall
be aesthetically pleasing and maintained continuously.
           D.   Camouflaging, whatever variety and however employed, shall be
of a type compatible with the immediate surrounding area and the City at large
in color, design, material, appearance, and its method of mimicry. For example,
an artificial oak tree, 100 feet in height would satisfy this requirement. An
artificial palm tree would not.
           E.   Antennas may be placed on facades of buildings if colored and
designed to match the color, texture, and style of the building to which it is
attached, and shall be attached at least twenty-five feet above grade.
         F.   Wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities shall
not be located in the district known as "the Harbour Town Historic District" as
defined in Section
1224.01 of this Planning and Zoning Code, or any other district which shall
become so designated as a historically and/or architecturally significant
district, or as a special district recognized and set apart as significant to
the community's heritage or traditions, unless it is proven that in order to
provide wireless telecommunications service, such towers or facilities may not
be located elsewhere within Vermilion. Any tower and related wireless
telecommunications facilities permitted in such district shall be located as a

and maintained as herein prescribed:
   (a)   In determining the number of parking spaces required, if such spaces
result in fractional parts thereof, the number of such spaces required shall be
construed to be the next higher whole number.
   (b)   Whenever a use requiring off-street parking is modified by an increase
in floor area, an increase in employees, a change in use or in any other
manner, additional parking spaces shall be provided if the total parking is
less than that specified hereinafter for such use as so modified.
   (c)   For the purpose of this Zoning Code, "floor area" means the gross
floor area of all floors within the structure, regardless of the use of such

   1278.01  INTENT.
   In permitting cluster subdivisions, it is the intention of the City to make
reasonable provisions through which, during the subdivision of land, natural
elements of the landscape and population density within districts may be
maintained, development costs may be lessened and physical living conditions
within the City improved. The provisions of this chapter are set forth to
provide extra amenities for the City and not as an automatic reduction of lot
size requirements.
(Ord. 66-103.  Passed 12-19-66.)
   1278.02  LOCATION.
   A cluster subdivision may be permitted in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-4a, R-5 and
R-6 Districts, if the following conditions are met. (Ord. 2012-39.  Passed 7-
23-12.)
   1278.03   MINIMUM DWELLING UNITS AND HOUSING TYPES.
   The cluster subdivision development shall contain a minimum of twenty
dwelling units. The cluster subdivision development shall contain only those
housing types as permitted in the zoning districts in which these cluster
subdivision regulations apply. (Ord. 71-77.  Passed 11-15-71.)
   1278.04  GROSS RESIDENTIAL DENSITY.
   The gross residential density (families per acre) shall not be greater than
if the tract were developed with minimum lot sizes as specified in this Zoning
Code for the appropriate type of residential use within the district.
   To compute the gross residential density of a given subdivision, the total
number of acres suitable for building is divided into the total number of
dwelling units proposed, the answer being in dwelling units or families per
acre. Areas not suitable for building, such as lakes, ponds, streams, swamps,
hazardous topography or soils and land which are not available to the owner for
development because of easements, shall not be considered as part of the gross
acreage in computing the maximum number of dwelling units that may be created
under this procedure, unless otherwise determined by the City Planning
Commission and Council.
(Ord. 66-103.  Passed 12-19-66.)
   1278.05  ACCESS TO COMMON LAND.
   A minimum of sixty percent of the total number of dwelling units in the
subdivision shall have direct access to common land as open space or for
recreational use and all other lots shall have public access and be in close
proximity to common land. (Ord. 66-103.  Passed 12-19-6B.)
   1278.06   TENURE AND MAINTENANCE OF COMMON LAND.
   The location, shape, size, intended use and legal responsibility for the
tenure and maintenance of common land must be approved by the Planning
Commission and Council and meet the following requirements:
   (a)   Land dedicated to the City shall be not less than ten acres in area.
   (b)   The common land shall be publicly dedicated to the City or to a
property ownership corporation or shall be reserved by deed for use in common
by the residents of the subdivision, each property owner receiving an undivided
proportionate share in such common land.
      (Ord. 66-103.  Passed 12-19-66.)
 
   1278.07   REDUCTIONS IN DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Reductions in lot width, area and yard requirements must be approved by the
Planning Commission and Council and shall not exceed twenty percent of the
district requirements. (Ord. 66-103.  Passed 12-19-66.)
   1278.08   DEVELOPMENT DESIGN.
   The proposed development shall be designed to produce an environment of
stable and desirable character and shall be approved as provided for in the
City Charter. (Ord. 66-103.  Passed 12-19-66.)
   1278.09  BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   Application Information. A person desiring to create a cluster
subdivision shall apply to the Administrative Officer for a building permit and
a certificate of occupancy for such subdivision. The application shall be
accompanied by a map or plat of the proposed cluster subdivision showing:
(1)   The dimensions and location of all existing and proposed buildings,
driveways, off-street parking areas, topography, abutting streets and highways
and other features within 200 feet of the property lines of the parcel.
(2)   Architectural plans for all proposed buildings, walls and fences.
(3)   Plans or reports showing the proposed collection treatment and disposal
of sewage produced on the area of the cluster subdivision.
(4)   Additional data which may be required by the Planning Commission and
Council to judge the subdivision and its effect upon the surrounding area and
the City.
   (b)   Findings of Planning Commission. The Administrative Officer shall
convey such plans and reports presented by the applicant to the City Planning
Commission, which shall make a study thereof and present its findings thereon
to Council.
 
   (c)   Decision of Council. Upon receipt of the findings of the Commission,
Council shall study the same and, if concurring therewith, shall direct the
Administrative Officer to issue the building permit and the certificate of
occupancy to the applicant. Such certificate of occupancy may contain
conditions attached thereto by Council as it deems necessary in the best
interest of the City and such certificate shall be revoked if such conditions
are not followed.
(Ord. 66-103.  Passed 12-19-66.)
   1278.10  EFFECT OF CHAPTER ON CHARTER.
   Nothing in this chapter shall abrogate or annul the provisions of the City
Charter.

   1280.01  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, as amended, there
exist lots, uses of land, structures and uses of structures and land in
combination which were lawful before this Zoning Code was passed or amended,
but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under this Zoning Code,
as amended. This chapter is intended to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but is not intended to encourage their
survival except as otherwise provided herein. It is further the intent of this
chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended,
nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere
in the same district, except as otherwise provided herein.
(Ord. 00-3.  Passed 5-1-00.)
   1280.02  EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   A nonconformity is hereby declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in
the districts in which such nonconformity is located. A nonconforming use of a
structure, land or a combination thereof shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this chapter (Ordinance 76-31, passed June 21, 1976), by
attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen
from off the premises or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would
be generally prohibited in the district in which such use is located.
(Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   1280.03   BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require
a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building for which
a valid building permit has been obtained, or on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 76-31,
passed June 21, 1976), and upon which actual building construction has been
carried on diligently. "Actual construction" includes the placing of
construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work is carried out
diligently.  (Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   1280.04  ERECTION OF SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS ON SINGLE LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single
lot of record on the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 76-31, passed
June 21, 1976), or an amendment thereof, notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This section
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that
yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or
both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which
such lot is located. Variances of requirements of this Zoning Code, other than
lot area or width, shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals as provided in Chapter
1264.  (Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   1280.05   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage of
this chapter (Ordinance 76-31, passed June 21, 1976), and if all or part of the
lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width
and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this chapter and no portion of such parcel shall be used or
sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with the lot width and area
requirements established by this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of any
parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements
of this Zoning Code. 
(Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   1280.06  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of the adoption of this chapter (Ordinance 76-31, passed
June 21, 1976), a lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by
this Zoning Code, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, provided that:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to
occupy  a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of this
chapter (Ordinance 76-31, passed June 21, 1976).
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 76-31, passed June 21, 1976).
   (c)   If any such nonconforming use of land is discontinued or abandoned for
more than one year, except when government action impedes access to the
premises, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this Zoning Code for the district in which such land is located.
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to this chapter shall be
erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
      (Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   1280.07  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of this chapter
(Ordinance 76-31, passed June 21, 1976) that could not be built under this
Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, bulk or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   If such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a
structure is destroyed by any means, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with this Zoning Code.
   (c)   If such structure is moved for any reason for any distance, it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located
after it is moved.
      (Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
 
   1280.08   NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or a structure and land in
combination, exists on the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 76-31,
passed June 21, 1976) that would not be allowed in the district under this
Zoning Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the  district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption of this chapter (Ordinance 76-31, passed June 21, 1976), but no such
use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   Any structure, or a structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which it is located and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (d)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or a structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than one year (except when
government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure
and land in combination shall not thereafter be used, except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   (e)   Where a nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, damage, destruction, alteration or removal of the structure,
totaling fifty percent or more of the appraised value of the structure at the
time of the destruction, shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land,
and such structure, the land or the structure and land in combination shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which they are
located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (Ord. 00-3.  Passed 5-1-00.)
   1280.09   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when such structure or portion became nonconforming
shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
(Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   1280.10   CONDITIONAL USES.
   Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under this
Zoning Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but
shall, without further action, be considered a conforming use.
(Ord. 76-31.  Passed 6-21-76.)
   1280.11   SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS IN NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   All single-family residential dwellings in existence at the time of the
adoption of this section that are located in nonresidential zoning districts
shall be considered as permitted uses for structures and land use in all zoning
districts, and shall remain as permitted uses until such time as such a
structure is damaged, destroyed, altered or removed beyond fifty percent of the
structure's appraised value at the time of such damage, destruction, alteration
or removal, or until the structure is voluntarily changed to a conforming use
for the zoning district in which the single-family dwelling is located.  Once a
single-family residential dwelling located in a nonresidential zoning district
is used for something other than a single-family residential dwelling, it shall
not be used as a single-family residential dwelling again.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the first sentence of this section, a single-family
dwelling located in a nonresidential zoning district that is damaged,
destroyed, altered or removed beyond fifty percent of its appraised value at
the time of such damage, destruction, alteration or removal may be rebuilt with
the prior aproval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Board shall grant such
approval if, but only if, the Board finds that: there are other residential
dwellings currently in use within 300 feet of the damaged, destroyed, altered
or removed dwelling; the adjoining properties will not be adversely affected by
such rebuilding; and the continued use of the damaged, destroyed, altered or
removed dwelling (after its rebuilding) for single-family residential purposes
will not be detrimental to the health or safety of the residents of the City,
including the residents of the dwelling that was damaged, destroyed, altered or
removed.

   1284.04  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Materials. Landscape buffering may include, but shall not be limited
to, trees, shrubs, bushes, earth berms or a combination thereof.
   (b)    Screening. Screening shall consist of plant material or other
nonliving durable landscape material.
   (c)    Buffered Areas.
(1)    Location and width. Buffering shall be located on those portions of land
devoted to a use within a less restrictive use class that border or abut land
devoted to a use within a more restrictive use class, and shall be a minimum of
ten (10) feet in width. Buffering width on land devoted to a Class 3, 4 or 5
use shall be not less than thirty (30) feet when bordering or abutting a Class
1, 2 or 3 use. Plant material and screening shall be distributed within the
buffer area so as to provide the desired opacity and visual screening.
(2)    Use. Designated buffered areas shall be used for no other purpose than
plantings or screening. Required buffer areas shall not be used for open
retention basins or driveway access unless approved by the Planning Commission.
(3)    Design. A buffered area shall be designated to permit access to easement
tracts to grantees to perform the functions for which the easements were
granted and to facilitate use of such easement areas for fire protection
purposes.
(4)    Opacity. Where buffering is required, the buffer material and screening
shall provide a minium of eighty percent (80%) opacity in the summer and sixty
percent (60%) capacity in the winter when viewed from two feet to ten feet
above the adjacent ground level.
   (d)    Fences and Walls. Fences shall be acceptable as part of a landscape
buffer where traffic noise and lights create a need for a greater buffer. When
used, they shall be of a decorative style and type. Walls and berms may be used
in unusual cases, as may be required by the Planning Commission to fulfill the
buffering requirements.
   (e)    Natural Plantings Requirements. Where natural plantings and  trees
exist in yards requiring buffering, such existing natural plantings and trees
shall be preserved and grades maintained so as to provide eighty percent (80%)
summer opacity and sixty percent (60%) winter opacity when viewed from two feet
to ten feet above ground level. Additional landscape material and screening may
be required to supplement the natural plantings to meet the desired opacity.
   (f)    Buffering Effect. The desired buffering shall be achieved not later
than twelve (12) months after the initial installation. The Planning Commission
may extend this period of time when a hardship would be created because of
expected growth or material shortages, but the Commission shall not extend such
period beyond five (5) years from the time the initial installation was to have
been or has been installed.
   (g)    Modification Requirements. The Planning Commission may modify or
change the location of a buffer area contiguous to side and rear property lines
where topographical problems prevent the installation of buffer materials or
where the buffering effect cannot be reasonably obtained at the lot line.
(Ord. 02-63. Passed 11-4-02.)
   1284.05   APPLICABILITY.
   (a)    Landscape buffering shall be mandatory between residential uses and
zoning districts and uses and zoning districts permitting Class 4 or 5 uses.
   (b)    All buffering requirements imposed under the provisions of this
chapter shall be installed and constructed before a Certificate of Occupancy is
issued for a new building or structure or a vehicular use area is used or
occupied. No existing building, structure or vehicular use area adjoining a
residential zoning district shall be expanded, altered or modified until the
plans are submitted by the owner or developer to the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission shall review such plans to determine if the changes
adversely affect any properties in a residential district. The Planning
Commission, after its review, shall require, where necessary, the establishment
of a landscape buffering area or a revision of a previously established
buffered alea
   (c) Owners or developers of off-street parking areas shall be required to
include a plan for buffering the parking area. Such plan shall be submitted to
the Planning Commission for approval. Such plan may be included as a part of
the development plot plan when a submission of a development plot plan is
required.
(Ord. 02-63. Passed 11-4-02.)
   1284.06  PROCEDURES.
   (a)    When an application for a development plan is made, the
Administrative Officer shall determine if the buffering requirement might be
applicable. If he determines that the request comes under the buffering
requirement, the Administrative Officer shall so advise the applicant and shall
submit a request to the Planning Commission that the matter be reviewed once
the applicant has furnished to Planning Commission the following:
(1)    A copy of the site plan;
(2)    The topography of the building site and surrounding area; and

description and sketch of the landscape buffer, preferably prepared by a
landscaping expert, which visually and narratively outlines the nature and the
effect of the proposed landscape buffer.
   (c)    The Planning Commission may request photographs or other descriptive
data if the  Planning Commission deems such data necessary. 
   (d)    A certificate of occupancy shall not be granted until buffering
requirements have been completed. If compliance is delayed because of the
growing season, a temporary permit to occupy may be granted by the
Administrative Officer. Such delay should not extend beyond the next growing
season following the date upon which the certificate of occupancy is requested.
   (e)    Where buffering is required, a building permit shall not be issued by
the Administrative Officer until an agreement has been reached between the
applicant and the Planning Commission as to the buffering requirement. The
agreement between the Planning Commission and the owner and/or developer shall
include, among other requirements, provisions for the following:

APPENDIX B -
THE ZONING MAP, A SUMMARY OF CONSIDERATIONS
   The Zoning Map, as contained in this report, is intended to effectuate the
Future Land Use Plan. The Future Land Use Plan is thus the primary item of
reference in establishment of the proposed districts.
   Certain existing physical features and developments strongly indicated parts
of the proposed map. As an example, the Special Residence Districts, Flood
Plain District and Lagoon District were, in large measure, already determined
by prior developments. All districts were influenced by existing land use.
Residential districts were further influenced by historical development,
existing lot sizes and proximity to the present center of the City and to major
highways.
   Commercial areas were influenced by the purposes they would serve and by the
existing highway pattern. The specific type of commercial district used was
determined by the need of the area concerned, the needs of the overall City and
the existing commercial uses. A separate Study Map was made showing the
location and amount of land commercially used. A comparison was then made in
tabular form of the amounts of land commercially used, zoned and proposed. The
amount of land proposed for commercial zoning by the staff was a large
reduction from that currently zoned, but a substantial increase over that
currently used.
   Industrial land was located recognizing railroads, highways, existing
industrial uses and residential neighborhoods. The separate industrial
districts used have been located to take advantage of available facilities and
to be in accord with nearby uses.
   It should be noted that the Zoning Map contained in the report, as well as
the text, is the result of numerous meetings with the Study Committee. All
questions concerning map districts were resolved by a consensus of Committee
opinion after a review of staff recommendations. Therefore, map and text
proposals shown in this report should not necessarily be construed as being
staff recommendations. For example, the staff does not recommend use of the I-
U District although it has been included at the Committee's request.

   (a)   (1)   Any person desiring to obtain a contractor's certificate of
registration and qualification in the City shall make application to the
Contractor Registration Board of Examiners as hereinafter provided for; and
whoever is unable to comply with subsection (d) below shall pay a twenty-five
dollar ($25.00) non-refundable fee to defray the costs of administering and
grading an examination and shall appear at such time and place as the Board may
designate to undergo such examination directed by the Board to determine his/
her qualifications and competency to do and perform such work as a contractor.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to attain a minimum passing score of seventy
percent on his/her first attempt to pass an examination, he/she may make a
second attempt without charge, provided he/she waits thirty days but not longer
than six months within the same calendar year from the date of the first
attempt to repeat the examination. If the applicant fails the examination on
his/her second attempt, then he/she must wait six months from the date of the
second attempt to repeat the registration process with all applicable fees. In
all cases, any attempt to become a registered contractor ends on December 31st
of each year. Subsequent opportunities for examination retakes will be granted
only after discussion and approval by the Contractor Registration Board of
Examiners at a regularly scheduled meeting.
         (Ord. 2011-25.  Passed 5-23-11.)
   (b)   In the event the contractor is engaged in such business as a
partnership or corporation, the application shall be made by one of the
partners or by a duly designated representative of the corporation. If
application is made by a representative of the corporation, such application
shall so state and shall specify the date of the passage of the corporation's
resolution so designating such representative. If the applicant applies as a
member of a partnership or as a representative of a corporation, the
certificate of registration and qualification so issued shall be in the name of
the person applying. However, such certificate holder shall be responsible for
such partnership or corporation, as the case may be, in abiding by the laws,
rules and regulations pertaining to the work as is customarily done by the
trade for which his organization has registered.
   (c)   Every application for a contractor's certificate of registration and
qualification of any type shall be in writing and on such form as the
Contractor Registration Board of Examiners prescribes, and shall set forth the
name, citizenship, residence, place of business or occupation of the applicant
and the length of time he has been engaged in the business or trade, together
with a stipulation that, if granted a certificate of registration and
qualification, he will comply with all laws, ordinances, resolutions and public
regulations of the City.
   Applications for a contractor's certificate of registration and
qualification shall be issued by the Building Department.
(Ord. 90-20.  Passed 4-2-90.)
   (d)   If the person desiring to obtain a contractor's registration submits
proof of current registration in the same classification from other
municipalities or a current state license in the same classification, an exam
shall not be required, subject to approval from the Contractor Registration
Board of Examiners.
(Ord.  02-32.  Passed 6-17-02; Ord. 2019-56.  Passed 10-28-19.))
   1444.07  CONTENT OF EXAMINATION.
   (a)   The Contractor Registration Board of Examiners shall examine every new
application for a contractor's certificate of registration and qualification as
to their practical and theoretical knowledge of the work in his/her particular
field and his/her ability to perform such work. Such examinations may be made
in whole or in part in writing. If the Board is satisfied that such applicant
possesses sufficient knowledge of all codes and regulations applicable to the
work of his/her particular field, to be performed in the City, and is
sufficiently skilled in his/her trade, the Board shall then forthwith certify
such fact to the Building Department and upon payment of the registration fee,
as provided in Section
1444.05, shall issue to such applicant a certificate of registration and
qualification in accordance with such certification, authorizing the applicant
to engage in work as a contractor in the City, within the meaning of Section
1444.01. In the case of the annual renewal of the certificate, no further
examination shall be required.
   (b)   Renewals - only contractors that were registered and in good standing
with the Building Department in the immediate previous year shall be considered
renewals. Any contractor that submits for registration, and whose previous
registration (if applicable) had lapsed for a period of one year or longer,
shall be considered as and treated as a new registration.
(Ord. 2011-25.  Passed 5-23-11; Ord. 2019-56.  Passed 10-28-19.)
   1444.08   BOND REQUIRED.
   No applicant who has passed his or her examination requirements and paid his
or her registration fee shall commence work as a contractor until such time as
the performance bond, as required by this section, is posted with the City. 
The Building Inspector shall issue no permit until all three requirements have
been satisfied.
   A contractor, after having successfully passed the required examination and
before the issuance of a certificate of registration and qualification, shall
furnish a surety bond on the City prescribed form, to be approved by the
Director of Public Service in the penal sum of twenty- five thousand dollars
($25,000) stating that the applicant shall save the City harmless from all
damages that may arise from negligence of the applicant or anyone in his or her
employ and as a guarantee that such contractor shall conform to and abide by
this Building Code and any and all other codes which may be incorporated into
this Building Code by reference and such other requirements as the City may
make in relation to construction work or installations and to the lawful orders
and directions of the Building Inspector and the Zoning Inspector.  Such bond
is to be in full force from the date of its acceptance and the issuance of the
certificate of registration and qualification by the Building Inspector to the
end of the year covered by the certificate and must be renewed annually on the
reissuance of the certificate.
   Failure to renew such performance bond annually shall be grounds for the
Building Inspector to refuse the issuance of building permits and to refer such
delinquent contractor to the Board of Examiners for its action if the lapse
continues beyond sixty days from the expiration of a certificate or license
renewal.  Such lapse shall be considered grounds for revocation of registration
and the commencement of licensing contractor procedures for renewal as if upon
initial application.
   Each contractor shall renew his or her bond and certificate at the beginning
of each calendar year without necessarily receiving notice from the Building
Inspector.  The Building Inspector shall make reasonable effort as he or she
deems appropriate to remind each such contractor of his or her obligations for
such renewal, but shall not do so more than once.  Any such reminder may be by
verbal or written communication from the office of the Building Inspector.  If
a contractor fails to comply with this requirement immediately following the
year of his or her registration, the Building Inspector shall recommend to the
Board of Examiners that the defaulting contractor’s registration be revoked
and, in addition, the Building Inspector shall not issue permits to such
defaulting contractor as aforesaid.
(Ord. 2004-70.  Passed 12-27-04.)
   1444.085 PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   No applicant who has passed his or her registration test and has paid
his or her registration fee shall commence work as either a contractor or
subcontractor within the corporate limits of the City, until such time as a
certificate, showing proof of general public liability insurance coverage, has
been posted with the Administrative Officer.
   (b)   A contractor or subcontractor, after having successfully passed the
required examination shall, additionally, before work is undertaken, file a
certificate of general public liability insurance coverage with the
Administrative Officer, which shall remain in full effect while any and all
business is undertaken within the corporate limits of the City, in the
following amounts:
      (1)   General contractor - $500,000 minimum coverage

coverage.
         (Ord. 2005-48.  Passed 7-18-05; Ord. 2019-56.  Passed 10-28-19.)
   (c)   The general public liability insurance coverage shall include a
provision in favor of the City which shall indemnify and hold harmless the City
for a period of one year from the date of completion of construction against
any and all actions, causes of action, liabilities, judgments, damages, costs
and expenses (including attorney's fees) which may arise directly or indirectly
or accrue against the City as a consequence of such construction.
   (d)   The Administrative Officer may request an annual certificate showing
the renewal of such coverage as he or she shall deem appropriate. Any lapse of
such coverage shall be considered grounds for the revocation of contractor's or
subcontractor's license and registration.

   1460.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Vermilion, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Vermilion has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated,  floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
(Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.02  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. 
(Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.03  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
      (Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.04  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Vermilion as identified in
1460.05, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by City
of Vermilion. 
(Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.05  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps
are adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective August, 19, 2008.  (Ord. 2008-25.  Passed 5-5-08.)
    (b)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Vermilion as required by

of these regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on file at the 5511 Liberty
Avenue, Vermilion, Ohio.
      (Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.06  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance the more restrictive
shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction
covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations. 
(Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.07  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.08   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Vermilion, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.09  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.10  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal.A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE.)  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Crawl Space.  A shallow enclosed unfinished space beneath the lowest
floor.  The floor of the crawl space shall be above the adjacent grade on all
sides.  To be compliant with minimum NFIP criteria, a crawl space must meet the
requirements for an “enclosure below lowest floor” found in
1460.23(d)(5).
   (g)   Development.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (h)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.  See “Lowest Floor.”
   (i)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (j)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (k)   Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (l)   FloodorFlooding.  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (m)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (p)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation for residential and non-residential structures.  In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (r)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one-half (0.5) of a
foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (s)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (z)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (aa)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Vermilion
Insurance Rate Map, May 5, 1970, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (bb)   Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
“Agency” does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general’s department, or any court.
   (cc)   Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (gg)   Special Flood Hazard Area.   Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (hh)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ii)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (jj)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.  Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during ten-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred. 
   (kk)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (ll)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (mm)   Violation .  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. 
(Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.11  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
The City Engineer is hereby appointed to administer and implement these

and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in
1460.24, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks.) shall prevail.
      (Ord.  2007-49.  Passed 8-6-07.)
   1460.22  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, and fire.  After such a damage event, the
Building Inspector shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Building Inspector and/or Floodplain Administrator
may implement other measures to assist with the substantial damage
determination and subsequent repair process. These measures include issuing
press releases, public service announcements, and other public information
materials related to the floodplain development permits and repair of damaged
structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to
assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged
structures materials and other information related to the proper repair of
damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of
substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance
claims.

         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         L.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in
1460.24(d)(3)A-K have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator or Building Inspector may present evidence or
testimony in opposition to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lorain or Erie County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1462.01   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to reduce public exposure to health risks
where trained law enforcement officers have determined that hazardous chemicals
from a suspected clandestine drug lab site or associated dump site may exist. 
Such sites may contain suspected chemicals and residues that place people,
particularly children or adults of child bearing age, at risk when exposed
through inhabiting or visiting the site, now or in the future.
(Ord.  2017-20.  Passed 5-15-17.)
1462.02   INTERPRETATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be construed to protect the public
health, safety and welfare.  In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted
for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare.  Whenever
the requirements of this chapter conflict with the requirements of any other
lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances or resolutions, the most
restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards shall govern.  In the event
state or federal clean-up guidelines are more stringent or that pre-empt local
regulations, its clean-up guidelines shall prevail.
(Od.  2017-20.  Passed 5-15-17.)
1462.03   DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   “Chemical dump site” means any place or area where chemicals or other
waste materials used or produced in a clandestine drug lab have been located.
   (b)   “Clandestine Drug Lab” means the unlawful manufacture or attempt to
manufacture controlled substances.  Only those labs which law enforcement
determine may contain residual contamination that could be harmful to occupants
are subject to this code.
   (c)   “Clandestine drug lab site” means any place or area where law
enforcement has determined that conditions associated with the operation of a
clandestine drug lab exist.  A “clandestine drug lab site” may include
dwellings, accessory buildings, accessory structures, motor vehicles, a
chemical dump site or any land.
   (d)   “Child” means any person less than 18 years of age.
   (e)   “Controlled Substances” means a drug, substance or immediate precursor

authorities that identify conditions associated with a clandestine drug lab
site or chemical dumpsite that present a risk to human exposure to harmful
contaminants and other associated conditions shall promptly notify the
appropriate municipal, child protection, and public health authorities of the
site location, property owner, if known, and conditions found.  Where the
Director of Public Safety determines that an immediate threat of human exposure
or injury exists, the City may conduct emergency dismantling and disposal of
drug processing apparatus and/or chemicals.  To the extent permitted by law,
the individual or entity responsible, and/or the owner of the property where
the site is found, shall be liable to the City for its costs incurred in
conducting the emergency dismantling and disposal.  Such costs may be recovered
pursuant to this chapter, without regard to whether a nuisance is declared or
an abatement order is issued.
   (b)   Declaration of Property as a Public Health Nuisance.  Any clandestine
drug lab site or chemical dumpsite identified by the law enforcement
authorities or the Director of Public Safety is hereby declared to be a public
health nuisance.  Upon identification of such a nuisance, the Director of
Public Safety shall issue an order to abate the public health nuisance.
   (c)   Notice of Public Health Nuisance to Concerned Parties.  Upon receipt
of the notification by law enforcement authorities, the Director of Public
Safety shall promptly issue a Declaration of Public Health Nuisance for the
affected property and post a copy of the Declaration at the probable entrance
to the dwelling or property.  The Director of Public Safety shall also notify
the owner of the property by mail and notify the following parties:
      (1)   Occupants of the property;
      (2)   All adjacent property owners and any other neighbors at probable
risk;
      (3)   The City of Vermilion Police Department;
      (4)   The primary mortgage holder; and
      (5)   Other federal, state and local authorities, and City Council
members which are known to have public and environmental responsibilities that
are applicable to the situation.
   (d)   Property Owner’s Responsibility to Act.  Immediately upon receipt or
posting of the Declaration of Public Health Nuisance or notification from the
Director of Public Safety, whichever shall occur first, the owner of the
property of the clandestine drug lab site shall:
      (1)   Cause the immediate evacuation by all occupants of those portions
of the property, including building or structure interiors which may place the
occupants or visitors at risk.
      (2)   Contract with appropriate environmental testing and cleaning firms
to conduct on-site assessment, complete clean-up and remediation testing and
follow-up testing, and determine that the property risks are sufficiently
reduced to allow safe human occupancy of the dwelling.  The City shall
promulgate criteria for the assessment and remediation process.
      (3)   Provide the Director of Public Safety with written documentation of
the clean-up process, including a signed, written statement from the
environmental testing and cleaning firm that the property is safe for human
occupancy and that the clean-up was conducted.  The owner shall complete the
remediation and post-remediation assessments within ninety (90) days from the
date of the Declaration of Public Health Nuisance.
   (e)   Property Owner’s Responsibility for Costs.  The property owner shall
be responsible for all costs of clean-up and testing of the site.  In addition,
the owner shall be responsible for all costs expended by the City, not limited
to: time spent posting the property, notifying the owner(s), inspections, etc.
   (f)   City Responsibilities and Recovery of Public Costs.  If the City is
unable to locate the property owner within fourteen (14) days or the property
owner fails to arrange appropriate assessment and clean-up pursuant to the
rules and regulations within fourteen (14) days, the Director of Public Safety
is authorized to proceed in a prompt manner to initiate the on-site assessment
and clean-up.  The City may abate the nuisance by removing the hazardous
structure or building if removal is more cost effective than clean-up.  All
costs shall be certified to the taxes for the parcel as a lien.  (Ord.  2017-
20.  Passed 5-15-17.)
1462.05  CLEARANCE LEVELS FOR RESIDUAL CONTAMINATION.
   At a minimum, the remediation firm shall conduct sampling and testing for
all of the constituents listed below unless evidence indicates that such
constituents were not used in the operation of the clandestine drug lab.  All
interior areas of the residually contaminated portion of a property that will
be occupied by people for any length of time for any purpose and all
furnishings and materials intended for reuse shall meet the following post-
remediation clearance levels, as recommended by the U.S. EPA:

   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Exterior Maintenance
Code of the City of Vermilion" or just the "Exterior Maintenance Code."
References throughout this chapter to "this Code" mean this Exterior
Maintenance Code.
(Ord. 94-89.  Passed 12-5-94.)
   1482.02  POLICY.
   It is the desire of Council and the Administration of the City to provide
for the residents of the City a clean, healthy, safe and protected environment
in which to live. There have been found to exist, within the City, premises and
structures, used for residential and nonresidential purposes, that are
substandard and that, as viewed, exhibit exterior structural deterioration,
lack of maintenance, improper storage of equipment and supplies, the existence
of fire hazards, and unsightly and unsanitary conditions which constitute a
menace and threat to the health, safety, public welfare, comfort and well-being
of the people of the City.
   Because of the lack of property maintenance of the exterior of structures
and premises, and permissive and progressive property deterioration, certain
properties within the City are creating blighting conditions and fostering an
unsanitary and unsightly environment. 
   Unless these blighting, deteriorating, unsanitary and unsightly conditions
are curtailed, removed and prevented from occurring in the future, they will
lead to the continuation, extension and aggravation of urban blight.

   1482.03   PURPOSES; INTERPRETATION.
   The purposes of this Exterior Maintenance Code are to protect the public
health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance and conditions of all residential and nonresidential

remedial and essential for the public interest and it is intended that this
Code be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
