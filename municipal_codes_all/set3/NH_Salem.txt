Code of Ethics for Selectmen
[Adopted by the Board of Selectmen 11-14-1977, last reaffirmed
4-2-2013 (Ch. 40, Art. I, of the 1995 Code)]
§ 33-1. Declaration of policy.
The proper operation of democratic government requires that public
officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that
governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain;
and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for
the Board of Selectmen. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical
standards of conduct for Selectmen by setting forth those acts or actions
that are incompatible with the best interest of the Town and by directing
disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interests in matters
affecting the Town. The provisions and purpose of this code and such rules
and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best
interests of the Town of Salem.
§ 33-2. General responsibilities.
Public officials are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of
the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States
and the Constitution of this state and to carry out impartially the laws of the
nation, state and municipality and thus to foster respect for all government.
They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of
morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of
personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their
primary concern.
§ 33-3. Loyalty to the electorate; compliance with law.

expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those
objectives.
B. Board of Selectmen members should not exceed their authority or
breach the law. A Selectman shall not attempt to induce an officer or

an unlawful act or to act in violation of any lawful statute, ordinance,
regulation or legal order.

§ 33-5. Conflicts of interest.
No Selectman shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a
financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible
with the proper discharge of his official duties in the public interest or
would tend to impair his independence of judgment or action in the
performance of his official duties. Personal, as distinguished from financial,
interest includes an interest arising from blood or marriage relationships
or close business association. Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated
below for the guidance of Selectmen:
shall disqualify the candidate for appointment, except with reference to
positions filled by appointment by the Board of Selectmen.
B. Use of public property. No Selectman shall request or permit the use of
Town-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal
convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the
public generally or are provided as municipal policy for use in the
conduct of official business.
C. Obligations to citizens. No Selectman shall grant or deny any special
consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen which is not
available to every other citizen. Furthermore, no Selectman should
make, encourage or accept any ex parte or other unilateral application
or communication that excludes the interests of other parties in a
matter under consideration when such application or communication is
designed to influence an official decision or conduct of the official
himself or other Selectmen or agencies in order to obtain favored
treatment or special consideration to advance the personal or private
gain of himself or others.
A. Incompatible employment. No Selectman shall engage in or accept
private employment or render services for private interests when such
employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his
official duties or would tend to impair his independence of judgment or
action in the performance of his official duties.
B. Disclosure of confidential information. No Selectman shall, without
proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning
the property, government or affairs of the Town, nor shall he use such
information to advance the financial or other private interest of himself
or others.
C. Gifts and favors. No Selectman shall accept any valuable gift, whether
in the form of service, loan, thing or promise, from any person, firm or
corporation which to his knowledge is interested directly or indirectly
in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the Town, nor shall
any such official accept any gift, favor or thing of value that may tend to
influence him in the discharge of his duties or grant in the discharge of
his duties any improper favor, service or thing of value.
§ 33-4 SALEM CODE § 33-5

§ 33-6. Use of influence.
No Selectman or candidate for the office of Selectman shall promise an
appointment to any municipal position as a reward for any political activity.

is a party.
(3) A Selectman may appear before Town agencies on behalf of
constituents in the course of his duties as a representative of the
electorate or in performance of public or civic obligations.
However, no Selectman shall receive any gift or compensation that
is contingent upon a specific action by a Town agency.
E. Contracts with the Town. Any Selectman who has a substantial or
controlling financial interest in any business entity, transaction or
contract with the Town or in the sale of real estate, materials, supplies
or services to the Town shall make known to the proper authority such
interest in any matter on which he may be called to act in his official
capacity. He shall refrain from voting upon or otherwise participating in
the transaction or the making of such contract or sale. A Selectman
shall not be deemed interested in any contract or purchase or sale of
land or other thing of value unless such contract or sale is approved,
awarded, entered into or authorized by him in his official capacity.
F. Disclosure of interest in legislation. A Selectman who has a financial or
other private interest in any legislation shall disclose on the records of
the Board or other appropriate authority the nature and extent of such
interest. This provision shall not apply if the Selectman disqualifies
himself from voting.

shall direct or request the appointment of any person to or his removal
from office by the Town Manager or by any of his subordinates or in any
manner take part in the appointment or removal of officers and
employees in the administrative service of the Town unless otherwise
provided in law. The Board and its members shall deal with the
administrative service solely through the Town Manager, and neither
the Board nor any member thereof, except as authorized by statute or
local ordinance, shall give direct orders to any subordinates of the Town
Manager, either publicly or privately.
§ 33-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 33-6
1:29
this section shall mean any activity inconsistent with recognized practices
allowed by the laws of the State of New Hampshire and the Town of Salem.
§ 33-7. Applicability and interpretation.
§ 33-8. Sanctions.
Violation of any provisions of this code should raise conscientious questions
for the Selectman concerned as to whether voluntary resignation or other
action is indicated to promote the best interests of the Town. Violation may
constitute a cause for such action as implementation of disciplinary action
as prescribed by state statute.
§ 33-9. Creed for Board of Selectmen.
As a Selectmen I believe: that the proper operation of democratic
government requires that public officials be independent and impartial in
their judgment and actions; that government decisions and policy be made
in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not
be used for personal gain; that the public have confidence in the integrity
of its government and public officials; and that the realization of these
ends is impaired whenever there exists or appears to exist an actual or
potential conflict between the private interests of a governmental official
and his public duties. The public interest requires ethical standards with
respect to official conduct. Therefore, as a Selectman of the Town of Salem,
New Hampshire, I assert my solemn belief that the primary responsibility
for maintaining a high level of ethics among the Board of Selectmen falls
upon the Board of Selectmen as the governing body elected by the people.
Consequently, as a Selectman, I believe it is my duty to:
A. When a Selectman has doubt as to the applicability of a provision of this
code to a particular situation, he should apply to the Board of
Selectmen for an advisory opinion and be guided by that opinion when
given.
B. The applicant should not vote in the proceedings of the Board of
Selectmen leading to the advisory opinion.
C. Any member of the Board of Selectmen may question the applicability
of the code regarding another member of the Board of Selectmen. Said
member shall request a meeting of the Board of Selectmen for an
advisory opinion, and all parties shall be guided by that opinion when
given. Action taken under this section should be considered by the
Board of Selectmen as a legal matter and acted on accordingly. The
Selectman shall have the opportunity to present his interpretation of
the facts at issue and of the applicable provision(s) of the code before
such advisory decision is made. This code shall be operative in all
instances covered by its provisions except when superseded by an
applicable statutory or charter provision and statutory or charter action
is mandatory or when the application of a statutory or charter provision
is discretionary but determined to be more appropriate or desirable.
§ 33-6 SALEM CODE § 33-9
1:30
A. Respect the importance of American ideals of government, of the rule of
law, of the principles of public administration and of ethical conduct in
the performance of my public duties.
B. Represent and work for the common good of the Town of Salem and not
for private interest, assuring fair and equal treatment of all persons,
claims and transactions coming before me in my official capacity.
C. Refrain from accepting gifts or favors or promises of future benefit
which might compromise or tend to impair my independence of
judgment or action as a Selectman.
D. Learn the background and purposes of major motions before voting.
E. Faithfully perform my duties as a Selectman by attending all sessions of
the Board and of its committees of which I am a member, unless unable
to do so for some compelling reason or disability.
F. Help the Board maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct by
refusing to approve breaches of public trust or improper attempts to
influence legislation and by being willing to vote to censure or
otherwise discipline any Selectman who willfully violates the duly
established rules of conduct for Selectmen.
G. Disclose all sources of income which may represent a substantial
conflict of interest with my duties as a Selectman and to disclose the
nature and extent of my interest as an officer, agent, member or owner
of any business entity or other association which is doing business with
the Town of Salem, such disclosure to be made to the Board of
Selectmen.
H. Refuse to represent private interests before Town agencies or in the
courts, except as may be my duty toward constituents, such service to
be rendered without compensation, and refuse to accept or engage in
any employment incompatible with my public duties.
I. Disclose any private interest I may have in legislation before the Board
or to refrain from voting when such interest is in substantial conflict
with my public duties.
J. Refrain from disclosing confidential information concerning any
employee, resident or the Town of Salem itself.

Franchising Authority
[Adopted by the 1977 Town Meeting (Ch. 19, Art. I, of the 1995
Code)]
§ 219-1. Establishment of franchising authority.
The Town hereby authorizes the Selectmen to act as the Town's franchising
authority for the regulation of cable television systems.

ARTICLE II
Public Access Television Policies, Procedures and operating rules
[Adopted by the Board of Selectmen 11-27-1995 (Ch. 19, Art. II, of
the 1995 Code)]
§ 219-2. Adoption of rules.
The franchising authority has adopted the following to govern public access
broadcasting in the Town.
§ 219-3. Introduction.
§ 219-4. General facility policies.
SCTV is pleased to provide facilities, equipment and channel time for
community television productions. In return, all users should be mindful of
the following rules:
A. Salem Community Television (SCTV)28 is committed to the idea that
community and public access programming should be community
television serving the greater Salem community. The programs
broadcast on SCTV should be for, by, and as needed by the community.
B. SCTV is operated pursuant to Section 14 of the franchise agreement
between the cable company and the Town of Salem. That section
provides that one channel shall be assigned for public access, one for
educational, and one for governmental use. These rules govern public
access. The rules governing governmental access programming shall be
promulgated by the governing body of the Town of Salem.29
C. Every person who either lives, works or is involved in organizations in
the Salem community can produce or work on a public access cable
television program. The fundamental feature of this community
resource is access. Once a community person has been properly
trained, he or she can work on a program for SCTV. Programming on
SCTV blends community volunteer and staff-produced programs, as
well as prerecorded programs, all designed to serve the unique needs of
the Salem community.
D. The public is invited to participate in creating these programs.
A. Obey all rules and regulations adopted by SCTV regarding equipment
and facility use, program planning and any other requirement set forth
in these rules.
B. No smoking, food or beverages are allowed in the control room or
studio area at any time.
28.Editor's Note: Throughout this chapter, "CTV-38" was amended to "SCTV" at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
29.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 219-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-4
1:75
§ 219-5. Definitions.
For the purposes of these operating rules, the following definitions shall
guide staff of SCTV and users:
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING  Programming which has been produced
by the Salem School District for inclusion on the educational channel.
This includes but is not limited to School Board meetings, staff-produced
features on school business, including programming created by students
and sporting events, and information the school releases to the public.30
GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMMING  Programming which has been
produced by the Town government or channel staff. This includes but is not
limited to local public meetings, staff-produced features on Town business,
and information the Town releases to the public.31
LOCAL ORIGINATION  Programming entirely planned or produced by
SCTV staff.
PUBLIC ACCESS PROGRAMMING  Programming which has been
produced by the public. When the program is produced using SCTV
facilities and equipment, it means that the production arrangements are
made by the volunteer public access producers and the crew is primarily
volunteer. In this instance, SCTV staff is largely there in an advisory
capacity, to provide training, program proposal review, assistance in lining
up crews, basic studio setup, and occasional crew assistance. When an
access user brings in a prerecorded tape or cablecast, it is also considered
public access. In both these instances, SCTV, by federal law, may not edit or
control content.
§ 219-6. Program planning and promotion.
C. Users may not transfer channel or studio time or time for equipment
use.
D. No use of phones or other office equipment is permitted unless
otherwise specifically permitted by staff of SCTV.
E. Users should make appointments in advance for program-related
consultation with SCTV staff.
F. Anyone found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or found to
be carrying a weapon of any kind, will be removed from the premises.
G. Violation of these rules or any of the rules stated in these rules may
result in the loss of privileges.
A. Introduction. Successful programming depends on a combination of
good planning, production and promotion. Each element in this process
is equally important. These rules are designed to guide the user
30.Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
31.Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 219-4 SALEM CODE § 219-6

through the process of getting programs on SCTV. The following basic
guidelines should assist the user:
(1) Read these rules. These rules acquaint the user with program
planning and promotion, how to sign out equipment and facilities,
the operating rules governing the facility, and how to schedule
channel time.
(2) Assign an access user's agreement. This document certifies that
you have read, understand, and will abide by the operating rules
and that you agree to be solely responsible for the content of any
programs you produce or schedule for cablecast.
B. Planning and production.
(1) Using SCTV facilities and equipment to produce your program.
(a) Get certified for the appropriate facilities or equipment, either
by taking SCTV sponsored training workshops or by
demonstrating experience.
(2) Follow the procedures for use set forth in these operating rules for
use of facilities or equipment.
(a) Portable or field production. At least 14 days before you plan to
begin taping, fill out a program planning proposal and a
portable equipment request form. After taping is completed,
hand in a facilities request form to schedule editing and
necessary post-production.
(b) Studio production. At least 21 days before you plan to use the
studio, fill out a program planning proposal and a facilities
request form. A crew sign-up sheet is also available. Assemble
a crew, get your script, talent, set, props, etc.
(3) Program planning proposal. This assists both you and the staff in
planning successful productions. The proposal should describe the
program idea, list the target audience, and outline production
needs. If this proposal is carefully crafted, the user will be more
likely to select the appropriate production format, facilities and
equipment needed to complete the program. The program planning
proposal will also determine if the program is public access or
community program, which affects production responsibilities and
copyright ownership, or fill out a channel time request form in
order to schedule cablecast times and dates.
C. Scheduling a prerecorded tape for cablecast.
(1) Fill out a prerecorded channel time request form.
(2) Confirm your cablecast date and time and bring in the tape.
§ 219-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-6
1:77
§ 219-7. Eligibility to use facilities and equipment.
D. Program promotion. Producing a program marks the halfway point
toward concluding your responsibility as a public access producer.
Equally important to planning and producing a show is promoting the
program. All SCTV users are asked to actively promote their program.
What follows are a few examples of how a producer can build an
audience:
(1) Tape a thirty-second promotion for your program.
(2) Schedule a message for the community bulletin board.
(3) Call your friends, relatives and associates who might be interested
in the program.
(4) Work with SCTV staff to develop a press release, particularly when
your program concerns a vital community issue.
(5) Posters and flyers are also a good way to promote a program.
A. Equipment and facilities are available to community members or
organizations on a first come, first served, nondiscriminatory basis,
provided that:
(1) All prospective users have successfully completed applicable SCTV
training and have been certified by SCTV in the use of equipment.
Alternatively, prospective users may be eligible if they can
demonstrate, on a standardized equipment use test, the basic
operation of the requested video equipment. If an access user has
not used the equipment or facilities for more than one year,
recertification may be required.
(2) The prospective user must present appropriate identification,
which shall be either:
(a) Driver's license;
(b) Social security card;
(c) Access user ID card; or
(d) Other identification establishing the identity of the prospective
user.
(3) Prospective users must complete all necessary facility and
equipment request forms and have those completed forms
reviewed and approved by SCTV staff.
B. Any community member who meets the above requirements may
request facility or equipment use. Community members include
residents of the community, representatives or employees of
organizations located within the community, and representatives or
employees of agencies which serve the community.
§ 219-6 SALEM CODE § 219-7
1:78
§ 219-8. Use of facilities and equipment.
C. Nonresidents formally enrolled in a student internship program at
SCTV may use the equipment and facilities.
D. Technical assistance.
(1) Successful public access programming depends on participation by
many active, trained volunteers who use video communication tools
in order to independently reflect their ideas. Because of this, and
limited staff time, SCTV generally cannot provide video production
services for community members or organizations, except in
special circumstances. Staff will assist community members in
assembling production crews from among trained and qualified
community volunteers. Community organizations planning to do
programs on a regular basis are encouraged to form a television
production committee, which SCTV will then train.
(2) Technical assistance and advice for the production of public access
programming will be provided on a first come, first served,
nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with these policies.
E. Scheduled facility and equipment time is not transferable. No
exchanges of time may be made between users.
A. General rules.
(1) Equipment is available on a first come, first served,
nondiscriminatory basis. If a conflict arises over priority of
equipment use, the equipment will be assigned to a public access
producer in the same way used to reconcile program scheduling
conflicts. (See § 219-10, Scheduling priorities.)
(2) Cancellation of equipment or facility reservations should be made
at least 24 hours in advance, except in the case of emergency.
Repeated last minute cancellations may result in loss of privileges.
(3) Confirmation of facility and equipment reservations must be made
48 hours in advance.
(4) Users should only identify themselves as public access producers,
not as employees or staff of SCTV or the Town of Salem.
(5) Additional materials for productions, beyond those supplied by
SCTV (i.e., sets, graphics, videotapes, other materials, etc.), must
be supplied by the user and must be removed after the production.
(6) Eligible users for any equipment or facilities will be loaned a
portable hard drive for files per program. Additional needs will be
considered on a case-by-case basis by the staff of SCTV.32
32.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 219-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-8
1:79
(7) Working tapes and files.33
(a) SCTV-owned working tapes and files will be held at the studio
for a maximum of 30 working days. After that time, if previous
arrangements have not been made, SCTV will contact the
public access producer and ask that person either to:
[1] Make arrangements to buy the tape or replace it with
approved tape stock;
[2] Dub the tape onto the producer's own videotapes;
[3] Schedule post-production sessions; or
[4] Bulk erase and recycle the work tapes.
(b) If the public access producer does not respond to these
requests after staff makes a reasonable attempt to contact the
producer, work tapes will be subject to recycling at the
discretion of staff.
(8) Individuals using SCTV equipment, or studio and post-production
facilities, will not change wiring, patch bays or components without
staff permission or supervision. No attempts should be made to
work on or repair equipment. Any damage caused in this manner
will be charged to the user. A loss of privileges will result from such
equipment abuse.
(9) Individuals using SCTV equipment should report any defects or
problems to the staff.
(10) Producers found to be misusing or abusing the equipment may be
asked to repeat training or testing and/or be subject to loss of
privileges.
(11)No food or drink shall be brought into the studio, control room, or
mobile van. Smoking is also prohibited in these areas.
(12) SCTV staff may waive certain of the equipment and facility rules at
its discretion.
B. Use of portable equipment.
(1) Reservations for equipment use may be made up to one month in
advance and must be made at least one week in advance.
Reservations can be made with staff either in person or by
telephone.
(2) Equipment may be borrowed for a maximum of 24 hours during the
week and 48 hours over the weekend. Longer loan periods must be
requested at the time the reservation is made and will be honored
at the discretion of staff.
33.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 219-8 SALEM CODE § 219-8
1:80
(3) Equipment must be picked up and returned during staff hours.
Pickups and returns must be made at least 30 minutes before the
facility closes. On weekends, equipment must be picked up by
Friday at 4:30 p.m. and returned before 9:30 a.m. the following
Monday. Failure to return equipment when due may result in
suspension of user privileges.
(4) Persons holding equipment reservations must follow these
checkout and check-in procedures:
(a) Checkout.
[1] Show required identification to staff.
[2] Sign all required forms and equipment checklists.
[3] Assemble and test requested equipment, if directed by
staff.
(b) Check-in.
[1] Equipment must be returned on time.
[2] Any problems with equipment or damage should be noted
on the equipment checklist and brought to the staff's
attention.
[3] Both the user and the staff person checking in equipment
must initial the equipment user form, to confirm both that
the equipment has been returned and the condition in
which the equipment is returned.
(5) Users are responsible for loss or damage due to negligence or
abuse while the equipment is checked out to them.
(6) Users with equipment already checked out will not be allowed to
check out additional equipment unless special arrangements are
made with staff.
(7) Eligible users under the age of 18 who wish to borrow portable
equipment must be accompanied by a parent, guardian, or a
qualified adult access user who signs a release stating that the
adult accepts responsibility for the equipment and its use by the
minor.
(8) Only in special cases and with staff permission can users take
equipment outside of the community being served by this SCTV
facility.
C. Use of studio.
(1) In order to schedule the studio and control room, a community user
(and all crew members) must be certified for studio production.
§ 219-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-8
1:81
(2) A minimum of three weeks' or 21 clear days' notification for
scheduling of a studio production is required.
(3) All required formatting and facility request forms must be filled out
by the user and approved by staff before the studio will be
scheduled.
(4) Producers are entitled to a maximum of three hours per session
with a maximum of six hours per week in the studio, postproduction
or editing facilities. Scheduled studio time includes the
time needed to put up and break down the set.
(5) Users must show up on time for scheduled studio productions and
must have the studio and control room equipment and set put away
before the end of the scheduled time period. SCTV staff
recommends that users allow at least one hour before and after the

the studio. Additionally, staff recommends that users schedule time
within the scheduled studio time to brief the crew and talent on the
planned production.
(6) Scheduled studio productions will be cancelled if the production
crew does not show up within 30 minutes after the start of the
scheduled facility time.
(7) Users under the age of 18 who wish to schedule the studio or
participate in a studio production must have written permission
from their parent or guardian.
D. Use of editing and post-production facilities.
(1) In order to schedule and use the editing or post-production
facilities, a community user must be properly certified for such use.
(2) Requests for use of the SCTV post-production or editing equipment
shall be made at least 48 hours in advance, subject to discretion of
staff.
(3) All required forms for facility use must be completed before the
facility is scheduled.
(4) Users under the age of 18 who wish to schedule the editing and
post-production facilities must have written permission from their

E. Waivers. The limitations and restrictions stated above may be waived by
SCTV staff pursuant to the following procedure:
§ 219-8 SALEM CODE § 219-8
1:82
§ 219-9. Program scheduling and cablecasting.
SCTV will attempt to honor all requests for channel time scheduling in
accordance with the following procedures. Subsection A applies to all
programs submitted for cablecast. Subsection B applies to local programs
produced at the SCTV facility. Subsection C applies to prerecorded
programming not produced at the SCTV facility. Any conflicts over program
scheduling will be settled based on the rules and scheduling priorities.
(1) An application in writing seeking a waiver of specific provisions
shall be filed at least three days before any limitation or restriction
has been exceeded.
(2) SCTV staff shall rule on the application based on the following:
(a) The limitation or restriction constitutes a practical difficulty.
(b) The purpose of public access programming on SCTV and the
interest of the community will be promoted by granting the
waiver.
A. General procedures.
(1) Scheduling.
(a) Requests for channel time shall be processed on a fair and
equitable basis. The appropriate channel time scheduling form
should be used to schedule a cablecast. An access user may
specify alternative dates and times for the initial request.
(b) Channel time scheduling requests must be submitted at least
four weeks prior to the desired cablecast date. At the
discretion of the program director, and if the desired time slot
is available, the four-week submission rule may be waived to
allow the timely cablecasting of newsworthy events.
(c) Except for live and series programming, channel time will
generally not be scheduled until a program is complete.
(d) If scheduling allows, a taped program may be repeated two
times during any weekly period, for a total of four cablecasts.
(e) Tapes scheduled for cablecasting must be brought to the staff
at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled cablecast.
(2) Cablecasting requirements.
(a) Label. Before cablecasting, all programs must be clearly
labeled with the following information:
[1] Title of program.
[2] Cablecast date.
§ 219-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-9
1:83
[3] Producer's name.
[4] Length of program.
[5] Audio specifications (Channel 1 or Channel 2).
[6] In-cue and out-cue.
(b) Technical standards.
[1] Screening. SCTV staff will screen the submitted tape only
for the purpose of determining whether it meets minimum
quality standards for cablecast. Because most tapes are
produced by nonprofessional users, tapes are not expected
to meet regular TV broadcast standards. For example,
problems with color, contrast, etc., which may be cause for
rejection by a broadcast TV station will not usually cause
rejection by the SCTV staff.
[2] Videotape format. All videotapes supplied for cablecast
must be in the following formats:
[a] Audio quality of all videotapes will be constant and of
sufficient level to permit adequate reproduction on
SCTV transmission equipment.
[b] If SCTV staff determines that an abnormal number of
production problems exist with the tape, a producer
may be asked to retrain.
[3] Series scheduling.
[a] Regularly scheduled series time slots will be allocated
at the discretion of SCTV staff, provided that ample
time remains available for other community
programming requests.
[b] Series will be allowed for a maximum of six programs,
after which reapplication will be required.
Reapplication will be considered with respect to other
scheduling demands.
[c] A series time slot will be allocated for new series only
if:
[i] The producer has completed two tape
programmings prior to application; or
[ii] The producer has successfully produced two live
programs in the produced series.
[d] If a series producer regularly fails to have the
program ready for scheduled cablecast, the SCTV staff
§ 219-9 SALEM CODE § 219-9
1:84
may, at its discretion, assign the time slot to other
users.
B. Scheduling programs produced locally.
(1) The channel time request form must be filled out at least two weeks
prior to the desired cablecast date.
(2) Leader and trailer.
(a) The beginning of all cablecast programs must have a standard
format in the following order:
[1] Thirty seconds of color bars, with audio test tone at zero
DB;
[2] Ten seconds of standard slate; and
[3] Ten seconds of academy leader (countdown 10-2, with two
seconds of black).
(b) The end of a cablecast program must have a standard format in
the following order:
[1] Appropriate production credits;
[2] SCTV credit ("Produced at SCTV Studio");
[3] Copyright information (Producer's name and date); and
[4] Sixty seconds of standard black.
(3) Program credit for underwriting and grants of locally produced
programs.
(a) Underwriting for programs must be for goods, services, in-kind
contributions and/or donations that aid in developing or
improving programs.
(b) Credit for underwriting should be as follows: "This program
was made possible through a grant by _______________" or
"Goods and services used in this program were contributed by
_______________."
(c) Only the name of the underwriter or donor, not the product,
service, or contribution, can be listed in the credit. Such
credits can only be shown before and after the program.
(d) Verbal credit to donors and underwriters during a program is
not permitted.
(e) SCTV credit must be included in the closing credits.
§ 219-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-9
1:85
§ 219-10. Scheduling priorities.
Public access channel and facility time are provided on a first come, first
served, nondiscriminatory basis to any resident, organization or any other
community user filing a request, in accordance with the operating rules.
It should be understood, however, that since this is a shared community
resource, specific channel time and equipment use requests cannot always
be guaranteed. Moreover, channel capacity for public access is itself subject
to use of channel capacity for governmental access. Governmental access
programming has priority over public access programming.
(f) SCTV staff must be informed, in advance, of any such
underwriting and consulted about the proper format for
underwriting credit.
C. Scheduling prerecorded material.
(1) Prerecorded material is programming not produced at the SCTV
facility. Such programs will only be scheduled at the request of a
community user.
(2) A completed prerecorded channel time request form shall be
submitted at least four weeks prior to the desired cablecast date.
(3) The users are responsible for picking up their tapes within 15 days
after the last cablecast.
(4) After 30 days, SCTV assumes no responsibility for tapes left on the
premises.
A. Definitions. As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
FIRST-TIME USER  An individual or organization who or which has
not used either the equipment, facilities or channel time during the
preceding 12 months.
INDIVIDUAL USER  Any individual who has scheduled equipment,
facilities or channel time in his/her own name.
ORGANIZATIONAL USER  Any group or organization which has
scheduled equipment, facilities or channel time in its name. An
organizational user is subject to the same weekly facility and channel
limitations as individual users, whether one or several book time in the
name of their organization.
REGULAR USER  An individual or organization who or which has
used either the equipment, facilities or channel on two or more
occasions in the four-week period prior to the current request for
scheduling. Regular users also include those who have used the
facilities or channel on a monthly basis for at least six months prior to
the current request for such use.

§ 219-11. Program content.
Public access is a medium for community expression and free speech. No
individual will be denied the use of public access on the basis of race, sex,
age, physical disability, religion or political belief.
SCHEDULING CONFLICTS  When identical requests are received by
staff during the same working day.
B. Equipment, facilities or channel time scheduling conflicts.
(1) Scheduling conflicts. In general, equipment, facility and channel
time requests will be scheduled on a first come, first served,
nondiscriminatory basis. In the case of scheduling conflicts, the
following criteria, in order, will be used:
(a) User who have not been scheduled for their preference of
channel time or facilities/equipment use on two previous
requests shall be given scheduling priority on their next
request.
(b) First-time users shall have priority over regular users.
(c) Facility use for tape dubbing, practice, or any other personal
purposes shall have the lowest priority and may be bumped
from a requested time slot if facilities are needed for
programming.
(d) If none of the above apply, staff may resolve the conflict at its
discretion.
(2) All grievances or unresolved conflicts will be settled by the
grievance procedure outlined in these rules.
A. Program content.
(1) SCTV requires access users to accept full responsibility for
program content. This means that access users, alone, are
accountable for what they communicate. Therefore, access users
should become familiar with local and federal laws and any other
regulations that apply to program content and its cablecast.
Obscene programming is prohibited from broadcast on public
access programming, and the other types of programming
described below should not be shown on public access
programming:
(a) Obscene programming.
[1] For purposes of these rules, to determine whether
programming is obscene, the following test shall be
applied:
§ 219-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-11
1:87
[a] Whether the average person applying local community
standards would find that the work, taken as a whole,
appeals to the prurient interest;
[b] Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently
offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by
applicable state law; and
[c] Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
[2] Obscene programming is prohibited. The access
programmer must certify to SCTV that its programming
contains no obscene material.
(b) Indecent programming. For purposes of these rules, indecent
programming is programming that describes or depicts sexual
or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner
as measured by contemporary community standards. The
access user or programmer should certify to the cable operator
that its programming contains no indecent material.
(c) Programming soliciting or promoting unlawful conduct. The
access user or programmer should certify to the cable operator
that its programming contains no material soliciting or
promoting unlawful conduct.
(d) Material which constitutes libel, slander, or invasion of privacy
or which might violate any other local, state or federal law.
(e) Programs containing material which violates copyright,
trademarks or service marks. Use of such material generally
requires obtaining appropriate rights from music licensing
organizations, publishers, representatives, copyright holders,
broadcast stations, networks and any other person as may be
necessary for cablecast. Users may be asked to furnish written
authorization for use of such materials.
(f) Program material that creates the immediate danger of
damage to property or injury to persons, or the substantial
obstruction of law enforcement or other governmental
functions or services, or the deprivation of a legal right of a
person by threat, threat of force or physical action, or the
creation of a public nuisance.
(g) The direct or indirect presentation of lotteries or lottery
information, except for announcements pertaining to statesponsored
lotteries.
(2) Public access programming is, by tradition, nonprofit and
noncommercial. The channel time and facilities are provided in
order to benefit the community. An alternative avenue for
§ 219-11 SALEM CODE § 219-11
1:88
expression of commercial, for-profit expression is provided for
under the leased access provisions of federal cable law. Leased
access is channel capacity to be set aside for commercial purposes.
Accordingly, programming which is commercial should be aired
on leased access channels. Therefore, access programs should not
contain the following:
(a) Advertising material designed to promote the sale of
commercial products, businesses, services, or individuals.
(b) Direct sales or provision of commercial products, businesses or
services during a program.
(c) Material which identifies any product, service, trademark or
brand name in a manner that is not reasonably related to the
noncommercial use of such in the program and which
promotes the commercial gain of such products, services,
trademarks or brand names.
(d) The direct solicitation of funds without first receiving
permission from SCTV.
(3) Labeling of sensitive material.
(a) If an access user makes a good faith determination that the
subject material in a program may offend some viewers and/or
may not be appropriate for children, SCTV requires that the
following announcement be added to the beginning of the
program: "The following program may contain sensitive
material. Viewer discretion is advised."
(b) At its discretion, SCTV may insert the following disclaimer
between programs: "The following program is not a production
of SCTV and does not reflect the views and opinions of SCTV or
its employees."
B. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations regarding
political and issue-oriented programs.
(1) FCC regulations applying to political candidates and issues do not
apply to public access. The two best known rules are the equal
opportunity or equal time rule, which applies to political
candidates, and the fairness doctrine (no longer in force), which
stated that a broadcast programmer must give time, not
necessarily equal time, to diverse sides of an issue. The FCC
personal attack rule also does not apply to public access.
(2) Political candidates and access.
(a) Since FCC regulations concerning equal time for political
candidates do not apply to public access programming, SCTV
places no restrictions on use of channels and facilities by
political candidates, other than those applying to normal and
§ 219-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-11
1:89
§ 219-12. Program ownership and rights.
Both the public access producer and SCTV have the following rights with
regard to programming produced using the facilities and equipment
provided by SCTV:
equitable use of channel scheduling and facility time. SCTV
specifically reserves the right to impose content neutral,
reasonable time, place and manner regulation on political
candidate access by appropriate scheduling.
(b) No paid advertising will be accepted on behalf of candidates
for public office or political parties on SCTV. This includes
advertising, promoting and/or opposing ballot issues by
supporting groups or lobbying organizations.
(3) Coverage of public affairs issues and access. Public access users
are under no legal obligation to show any viewpoint other than
their own. Community residents with diverse viewpoints are
encouraged to use public access to express those views.
A. SCTV program rights in public access programs produced using SCTV
equipment and facilities.
(1) To retain the edited master of the program in its tape library.
(2) To make duplications of the program for noncommercial
distribution, except where permission has been expressly denied in
advance. Producers will always be given graphic credit in the
videotape of such use.
(3) To cablecast the program as often as is deemed appropriate.
B. Public access produced program rights.
(1) Ownership of rights to all original material.
(2) To select a minimum of one program date and time for cablecast in
accordance with scheduling priorities.
(3) To book facility time in order to make one duplicate tape of the
program produced. Fees for additional duplication will be charged.
(4) To request that program master videotapes held by SCTV be
discontinued from cablecast or erased in the event that program
information becomes outdated or obsolete.
(5) To play or distribute the videotape for nonprofit purposes only,
provided that SCTV is given graphic credit within the videotape of
each cablecast date or play.
C. Videotape ownership.
§ 219-11 SALEM CODE § 219-12
1:90
§ 219-13. Community bulletin board announcements.
A text information service is available, free of charge, to nonprofit
organizations providing public service announcements and/or event
information to the community.
(1) SCTV videotapes. SCTV provides videotapes for use during training
and workshops and for working and for master tapes of programs
being produced with SCTV equipment. These videotapes remain
the property of SCTV.
(2) Videotapes for copies. Videotapes for making duplicate (dubs) of
program masters or any other tapes must be purchased or provided
by the individual or group making the dub.
D. Restrictions.
(1) Personal profit and commercial use.
(a) Individuals, community organizations or any other community
users may not use the program or any of its outtakes for
personal profit or gain without the express written permission
of SCTV.
(b) SCTV may require that a producer share such profits in order
to compensate for the facilities, equipment, tape supplies, and
staff time that were provided to the producer.
(c) Community users found to be using the facilities or equipment
for personal profit without prior permission will be subject to
loss of privileges.
(2) Other duplications. Other than the right to assign to SCTV, only the
program producer has ownership and duplication rights for each
program. Other individuals or organizations should make
duplication arrangements with the program producer, unless SCTV
has prior written authorization for such duplication from the
producer.
A. Procedure for placing community bulletin announcement.
(1) To place a message on the calendar, complete the community
calendar request form and return by mail or bring in person to
SCTV studio.
(2) Message requests should be submitted two weeks prior to the
desired starting date.
(3) Messages will run at least one week prior to a scheduled event.
Messages will be removed the morning after the event has
occurred or the first workday thereafter.
§ 219-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 219-13
1:91
§ 219-14. Grievances.
(4) General messages that do not pertain to a specific event will be
shown as long as possible, depending upon space available. In
order for the message to be renewed, a request must be refiled.
(5) No solicitation of funds nor event price information may be given.
Phone numbers for the purpose of obtaining further information
are permitted.
(6) All other rules regarding limitations on content apply to messages
in cablecast.
A. Informal.
(1) Any grievance regarding assignment of workshop space, channel
time allocation, equipment and studio use, or any other matter
regarding SCTV facilities should first be discussed with the
program director or applicable staff person.
(2) If that consultation does not result in an acceptable solution, a
formal grievance may be filed pursuant to the formal grievance
procedure described below.
B. Formal.
(1) Any person aggrieved by a decision enforcing or interpreting these
procedures who is unable to resolve that grievance by the informal
procedure outlined above may file a written appeal to the Board of
Selectmen describing the nature of the grievance and describing
what procedure and operating rules are implicated by the appeal.
The Board of Selectmen may, at its discretion, hear the appeal
under this article or designate that the appeal be heard by another
authority. The Board shall have discretion to appoint an ad hoc
hearing authority or designate that the appeal be heard by a
standing or already constituted authority.
(2) The Board of Selectmen or its designee shall, within 30 days of
receipt of such a writing, hold a hearing on the grievance. The
program director of SCTV shall be provided a copy of the written
grievance and shall present the position of SCTV at the hearing.
(a) No formal rules of evidence or procedure shall be required for
such a hearing, but the Board of Selectmen or its designee
shall hear all evidence it deems relevant and shall permit both
parties to address the issues raised by the grievance.
(b) The Board or its designee may consider testimonial,
documentary or other types of evidence.
(c) Within 30 days of the close of such a hearing, the Board of
Selectmen or its designee shall issue a writing deciding the
grievance.
§ 219-13 SALEM CODE § 219-14
1:92
§ 219-15. Public record.
SCTV will maintain a complete public record of all persons, groups or
organizations requesting the use of channel time facilities and/or
equipment. These records will be made available to the public for inspection
during normal business hours. All records will be kept a minimum of two
years. Access to these records shall be governed by RSA 91-A, the New
Hampshire Right-to-Know Law.
[1] The decision of the Board or its designee shall be based on
the evidence submitted to it at the hearing.
[2] The decision may grant the grievance, deny the grievance,
or neither grant nor deny the grievance but modify the
interpretation and actions of SCTV in interpreting or
enforcing the operating rules.
(d) The decision shall remand the matter to the SCTV program
director for action consistent with the decision of the Board of
Selectmen or its designee on the grievance.

Land Disturbance
[Adopted 11-15-1993 (Ch. 182 of the 1995 Code)]
§ 252-1. General purpose and authority.
Chapter 155-E of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated requires
that, with several exceptions, all mining and excavation operations in the
state obtain prior approval and permit from the local municipality in which
the operation is to occur. The purpose of the statute and of these excavation
regulations is to minimize safety hazards created by open excavations; to
safeguard the public health and welfare; to preserve our natural assets
of soil, water, forests and wildlife; to maintain aesthetic features of our
environment; to prevent land and water pollution; and to promote soil
stabilization.
§ 252-2. Definitions.
§ 252-3. Permit required.
All excavation areas require a permit except lawful existing excavations,
stationary manufacturing plants, public highway excavations, and other
exceptions as allowed in RSA 155-E:2 and 155-E:2-A.
§ 252-4. Abandoned excavations.
A. Additional relevant definitions are contained in RSA 155-E, as
amended, and are made part of these regulations.
B. As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
EARTH  Sand, gravel, rock, soil or construction aggregate produced
by quarrying, crushing or any other mining activity or such other
naturally occurring unconsolidated materials that normally mask the
bedrock.
EXCAVATION  A land area which is used, or has been used, for
commercial taking of earth, including all slopes. Excavations shall be
considered commercial if earth material is sold or resold on or off
the excavation site. In addition, an excavation shall be considered
commercial if earth materials are transported to other land whose
ownership is different than the ownership of the land from which the
earth was excavated.
EXCAVATION AREA  The area within an excavation site where
excavation has occurred or is eligible to occur under the provisions of
RSA 155-E and these regulations.
EXCAVATION SITE  Any area of contiguous land in common
ownership upon which excavation takes place.
REGULATOR  The Town of Salem Planning Board.
§ 252-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-4
1:101
§ 252-5. Application for permit.
Except as provided for in § 252-3, any owner/operator subject to RSA 155-E
shall, prior to excavation, apply to the Planning Board for a permit for
excavation and submit a reclamation plan. The applicant shall also provide
a copy of the application to the Town of Salem's Conservation Commission
for comments. The permit application shall be signed and dated by the
applicant, and the excavation plan shall contain the applicable information
requested in the Excavation Application Checklist (see Appendix A).35
A. The permit and zoning exemptions under § 252-3 shall not apply to any
abandoned excavations as defined below.
(1) Any excavation, except for stationary manufacturing plants, for
which the affected area has not been brought into complete
compliance with the reclamation standards of these regulations
(§§ 252-6 and 252-8) shall be deemed abandoned if:
(a) No earth material of sufficient weight or volume to be
commercially useful has been removed from the site during
any two-year period; the regulator may extend the two-year
period if the owner/operator submits an acceptable timetable
for reclamation to the regulator and posts a performance
guarantee in a form and amount prescribed by the regulator
sufficient to cover the costs of reclamation;
(b) The excavation site is still in use but does not conform to the
site reclamation requirements of §§ 252-6 and 252-8 of these
regulations, or the owner/operator has not submitted an
acceptable reclamation timetable to the regulator and posted a
performance guarantee sufficient to cover the costs of
reclamation; or
(c) The owner/operator of the excavation has neither secured a
permit pursuant to these regulations nor filed a report of an
existing excavation with the Town of Salem by August 4, 1991.
(2) The regulator, after notice and hearing pursuant to RSA 155-E:7,
may order, in writing, the owner of any land containing an
abandoned excavation to either file an acceptable reclamation
timetable and performance guarantee within a stated reasonable
time by the regulator to do so or complete the reclamation in
accordance with these regulations within one year of notification.
B. Failure to complete said reclamation within the prescribed time period
may result in the regulator requesting the Board of Selectmen to
complete the reclamation at the expense of the Town. The Town's costs
shall constitute an assessment against the owner and shall create a lien
against the real estate on which the excavation is located. Such
assessment and lien may be enforced and collected in the same manner
as provided for real estate taxes.
§ 252-4 SALEM CODE § 252-5
1:102
Waiver requests pertaining to these regulations may be submitted in writing
to the regulator in accordance with § 252-16. All expenses for preparation
of all plans, maps, and reports accompanying the application shall be borne
by the applicant.
§ 252-6. Additional permit requirements.

regulations, shall be submitted, including such other information as the
regulator may reasonably require. [Amended by the Board of
Selectmen 11-2-2015]
B. Hauling information shall be submitted, including routes to be utilized
and the type and weight of motor vehicles involved, and the frequency
and schedule of operations of such vehicles shall be provided to the
regulator prior to the issuance of an excavation permit. The regulator
may require modifications to such plans and/or may place conditions
upon such operations, depending on surrounding land uses and road
conditions. The regulator reserves the right to conduct a traffic study at
the applicant's expense to ensure that public safety, neighborhood
compatibility and road capacity and condition have been properly
considered and addressed in the hauling plan.
A. Size and reclamation time limit on new excavations. No excavation of a
new area shall exceed five acres in size at any one time. Any permitted
excavation shall be reclaimed according to the approved application
within one year after the permit expiration date. If reclamation of the
site is not completed within one year after the permit expiration date,
the Town may declare part or all of the performance guarantee forfeited
and use these moneys to reclaim the site.
A. No excavation covered under RSA 155-E shall be permitted closer than
50 feet to the boundary of a disapproving abutter. If written
concurrence is received from an abutter, then the boundary setback
shall be 10 feet.
B. No excavation covered under RSA 155-E shall be permitted closer than
150 feet to an existing dwelling or to a dwelling for which a building
permit has been issued at the time the excavation is begun.

area or within 25 feet of any other perennial stream, river, or brook (as
delineated on United States Geological Survey maps), or any naturally
occurring standing body of water of less than 10 acres, prime wetlands
as designated in accordance with RSA 482-A:15, I, or any other wetland
greater than five acres in area as defined by the New Hampshire
Wetlands Bureau. [Amended by the Board of Selectmen
11-2-2015]
D. No excavation shall be permitted below road level within 50 feet of the
right-of-way of any public highway as defined in RSA 229:1 unless such
excavation is for the purpose of said highway.
E. Vegetation shall be maintained or provided within the buffer areas
required by Subsections A, B and C.
F. Appropriate erosion, sedimentation, air and water quality measures
shall be integrated into the excavation process. Excavations shall
comply with the grading, drainage, and erosion and sediment control
provisions of the Town's Subdivision Regulations.
G. Where the depth of excavation will exceed 15 feet and temporary slopes
will exceed 1:1 in grade, every reasonable effort shall be made to warn
of danger and/or limit access to the site. In addition, in accordance with
RSA 31:41-b, the regulator may require removal, stabilization, or
fencing of such hazardous embankments, for the protection of the
health and safety of the public.
H. Excavation practices which result in siltation in streams or degradation
of any water supplies are prohibited.
I. Topsoil shall be stripped from the excavation area and stockpiled for
use in subsequent reclamation of the site. It shall be protected from
erosion (e.g., by seeding, covering, or other acceptable practices). No
topsoil shall be removed from the site without specific approval from
the regulator.
J. All temporary structures required during excavation operations shall be
removed from the site within 30 days after such operations cease.
K. All vehicles transporting excavated material shall utilize adequate
covering and/or sideboards to prevent dust and spillage when loaded.
L. No fuels, lubricants or other toxic or polluting chemicals shall be stored
on site unless in compliance with state and federal laws or rules
pertaining to fuels and lubricants or other toxic or polluting chemicals.
M. Prior to the stripping of topsoil or removal of stumps or other material
from any land area that has not yet been excavated, the excavator shall
file a reclamation bond or other performance surety, as prescribed by
the regulator, sufficient to cover the cost of site reclamation.
N. Access roads leading to the excavation site shall intersect existing
streets and roads at locations that have been duly approved by state or
§ 252-7 SALEM CODE § 252-7
1:104
§ 252-8. Site reclamation standards.
Within 12 months after the expiration date of a permit issued under these
regulations, or of the completion of any excavation, whether subject to
permit or not (whichever occurs first), the owner of the excavated land shall
have completed the reclamation of the affected area(s). With the exception
of those excavations associated with stationary manufacturing plants, the
following minimum standards must be met as part of the reclamation:
local officials and in a manner that will not endanger the safety of
highway users and local residents. The provisions of RSA 236:13 and
236:14 (highway access) shall be adhered to by the applicant and shall
be shown on the excavation plan.
O. Permit approval shall be conditional on compliance by the applicant
with street and highway regulations promulgated by federal, state and
local units.
P. No excavation shall substantially damage any aquifer identified on
mapping by the U.S. Geological Survey.
Q. The applicant shall be responsible for a proportionate share of
refurbishing existing Town roads which access the excavation site and
for the repair of Town-maintained roads which are damaged as a result
of hauling earth from the site. The regulator may require these costs to
be part of the performance guarantee.
R. No solid and/or hazardous waste, septage, dredge spoils, or organic
waste and debris shall be disposed of on the excavation site unless
specifically authorized and/or permitted by the appropriate federal,
state and local authority(ies).
S. The applicable state statutes and regulations pertaining to forest
practice and timber harvesting shall apply to the removal of vegetative
cover at excavation sites.
T. The regulator shall approve the hours of operation. Specified days (e.g.,
Sundays and state and/or federal holidays) shall be restricted for
operation by the regulator. Hours of operation, including any machinery
use, other than those stipulated may be allowed if specifically
authorized by the regulator.
U. Excavation operations shall be set back at least 40 feet from wetlands
as defined in Chapter 490, Zoning, and it must be demonstrated that no
sedimentation of the wetlands will occur as a result of the excavation.
The regulator shall have the authority to require greater wetlands
setbacks in situations where it can be demonstrated that such setbacks
are necessary.
A. Reclaimed slopes shall blend with the surrounding terrain and shall not
be abrupt.
§ 252-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-8
1:105
§ 252-9. Prohibited projects.
The regulator shall not grant a permit under the following conditions:
B. All debris, stumps, boulders, etc., shall be lawfully disposed of in a
manner acceptable to the regulator or its designee.
C. Ground levels and grades shall be established as shown on the
approved reclamation plan as soon as practical during site excavation,
but not later than one year after excavation has been completed.
D. The responsible party shall not be released from its performance
commitment (performance guarantee) until the regulator certifies
compliance with all terms of the excavation plan and the reclamation
plan.
E. Any excavated area of five contiguous acres or more which is either
fully excavated per the approved plan (excluding bedrock) or from
which no earth materials have been removed for a two-year period shall
be reclaimed in accordance with § 252-6 and this section within one
year following such full excavation or two-year period, regardless of
whether other excavation is occurring on adjacent land in contiguous
ownership.
F. The regulator may require the elimination of any standing bodies of
water created in the excavation project that may constitute a hazard to
health and safety.
G. Upon completing the reclamation, the topography of the land shall be
left so that water draining from the site leaves the property at the
original, natural drainage points and in the natural proportions of flow.
A. Where the excavation would violate the operational standards of
§ 252-7 or the reclamation provisions of §§ 252-6 and 252-8.
B. Where existing visual barriers would be removed, except to provide
access to the excavation.
C. Where the excavation would substantially damage a known aquifer, so
designated by the U.S. Geological Survey in the report titled
"Geohydrology and Water Quality of Stratified-Drift Aquifers in the
Lower Merrimack and Coastal River Basins, Southeastern New
Hampshire, 1992."
D. For excavation within 150 feet of an existing dwelling or a dwelling for
which a building permit has been issued at the time the excavation is
begun.
E. Where the excavation is not permitted by zoning or other applicable
ordinances, unless the application is approved by variance or the
special exception procedure contained in RSA 155-E:4, III.
§ 252-8 SALEM CODE § 252-9
1:106
§ 252-10. Application for amendment.
When the scope of a project for which an excavation permit has been issued
is proposed to be altered so as to affect either the size or location of the
excavation, the rate of removal or the plan for reclamation, the owner
shall submit an application for amendment of his excavation permit. The
amended application shall be subject to approval in the same manner as
provided for an excavation permit.
§ 252-11. Hearing.
Prior to the regulator approving an application for a permit or an
application for an amended permit, a public hearing shall be held within 30
days of receipt of a completed application. A notice of said hearing shall be
sent to all abutters and shall specify the grounds for the hearing as well
as the date, time and place. At least 14 days' notice of the time and place
of such hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation in the
Town, and legal notice thereof shall also be posted in at least three public
places in the Town; the 14 days shall not include the day of publication
or the day of the meeting but shall include any Saturdays, Sundays and
legal holidays within said period. Within 20 days of said hearing or any
continuation thereof, the Planning Board shall issue a written decision
approving or disapproving the application, giving reasons for disapproval.
§ 252-12. Issuance of permit.
If the regulator, after public hearing, approves the application for a permit
and determines it is not prohibited by these regulations, it shall grant
the excavation permit upon the posting of a performance guarantee in
the amount determined by the regulator to be sufficient to guarantee
compliance with the permit. The performance guarantee shall be for a
reasonable time period determined by the regulator. A copy of the permit
shall be prominently posted at the excavation site and the principal access
thereto. A permit shall not be assigned or transferred without the prior
written consent of the regulator. Unless otherwise specifically decided by
the regulator, a permit shall be valid for a period of one year from the
date of issuance. The regulator may include in a permit such reasonable
conditions as are consistent with the purpose of RSA 155-E and these
regulations and may include excavation permit requirements which are
more stringent than the standards set forth in RSA 155-E, including the
provision of visual barriers to the excavation. A permit fee in an amount
determined by the regulator for application plan review and annual
compliance review, by the regulator or its designated agent, shall be
assessed to the applicant upon application for permit. In addition, fees may
be required for the municipality's designated engineer or other agents of
the regulator to periodically conduct required studies or field reviews at
F. Where an excavation is proposed below road level within 50 feet of any
highway right-of-way unless such excavation is for the purpose of said
highway.
§ 252-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-12
1:107
the excavation site to ensure compliance with the approved excavation and
reclamation plans.
§ 252-13. Bonding.
The regulator shall establish the amount of a performance guarantee prior
to the issuance of the excavation permit. The performance guarantee
amount shall be reasonably sufficient to guarantee compliance with the
restoration in compliance with §§ 252-6 and 252-8. The guarantee
requirements shall be based on the acreage of the project or approved
phases and the estimated per acre restoration costs. The performance
guarantee will be returned to the applicant when restoration work has been
completed and a final satisfactory site inspection has been conducted by the
regulator or its designee.
§ 252-14. Appeals.
If the regulator disapproves or approves an application for an excavation
permit or an application for an amended permit, any interested person
affected by such decision may appeal to the regulator for a rehearing on
such decision or any matter determined thereby. The motion for rehearing
shall fully specify every ground upon which it is alleged that the decision or
order complained of is unlawful or unreasonable, and said appeal shall be
filed within 10 days of the date of the decision appealed from. The regulator
shall either grant or deny the request for rehearing within 10 days, and if
the request is granted, a rehearing shall be scheduled within 30 days. Any
person affected by the regulator's decision on a motion for rehearing may
appeal in accordance with the procedures specified in RSA 677.
§ 252-15. Enforcement.
A. The regulator or its duly authorized agent may suspend or revoke the
permit of any person who has violated any provision of his permit or
these regulations or made a material misstatement in the application
upon which his permit was granted. Such suspension or revocation
shall be subject to a motion for rehearing thereon and appeal in
accordance with § 252-14.
B. Fines, penalties and remedies for violations of this regulation shall be
the same as for violations of RSA Title LXIV, as stated in RSA 676:15,
676:17, 676:17-a and 676:17-b. [Amended by the Board of
Selectmen 11-2-2015]
C. The regulator or its duly authorized agent(s) will conduct site
inspections to verify permit compliance on an annual basis, unless a
more frequent site visitation is necessary due to special characteristics
of the excavation or restoration plans. To ascertain if there is
compliance with this regulation, a permit issued hereunder or an order
issued hereunder, the regulator or its duly authorized agent(s) may
enter upon any land on which there is reason to believe an excavation is
being conducted or has been conducted since August 24, 1979.
§ 252-12 SALEM CODE § 252-15
1:108
§ 252-16. Waivers.
The regulator, upon application and following a public hearing, may grant
a waiver in writing in cases where, in the opinion of the Planning Board,
strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and
the waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations
(except as prohibited by RSA 155-E). The written decision shall state
specifically what standards, if any, are being relaxed and include reasonable
alternative conditions or standards. The regulator's decision on any waiver
request may be appealed in accordance with § 252-14.
D. Where these regulations are in conflict with other ordinances,
regulations or laws, the more stringent shall apply.

[Adopted by the Board of Selectmen 2-26-2018]
§ 252-17. General purpose and authority.
Per the Town of Salem, New Hampshire, Board of Selectmen, a person
shall not disturb, excavate, or open the ground or pavement in any street,
highway, sidewalk, or within the Town right-of-way, without first obtaining
authorization from the Municipal Services Department, Engineering
Division. Street opening permits shall be issued on an application form
provided by the Town.
§ 252-18. Permit.
All applications for a permit to excavate in, or open, a public right-ofway
shall include, for each permit applied for, the fees listed in general
permit conditions and construction requirements. The Municipal Services
Department is authorized to establish and publish rules, regulations, and
procedures, including general permit conditions and construction
requirements related to street excavation permits, and to prescribe the
forms necessary for the management and operation of the excavation
permit programs under this Code. These rules, regulations, and procedures
shall be subject to review and approval by the Board of Selectmen.
§ 252-19. Permit requirements.
Permit requirements are as follows:
§ 252-20. Violations and penalties.
Persons who operate without a permit or violate the provisions of any
permit required by this article shall be subject to the penalty outlined
in general permit conditions and construction requirements. If the
Engineering Division determines that an excavation is not being carried out
in accordance with the requirements, a written notice will be issued to the
persons or business entities in violation. The written notice will generally
contain pertinent information, including excavation location, violation, and
any applicable penalties assessed, including right to excavate in the Town.
A. Completed application.
B. Required bonding and insurance on file with Town.
C. Proposed traffic control plan.
D. Work zone photos with premarks.
E. Valid Dig Safe number.
§ 252-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-21
1:111
§ 252-21. Protection of streets.
Per Article 36 of the 1990 Annual Town Meeting: to prohibit excavation,
including utility cuts, within the traveled way of any newly reconstructed
roadway of the Town for a period of five years from such reconstruction,
except for emergency excavation which the Board of Selectmen determines
to be in the interest of public health and safety.
§ 252-22. Standard construction requirements.
A. In an effort to protect the Town's investment in its infrastructure,
excavations in newly constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or
overlaid pavements within the public right-of-way or on Town property,
no excavation shall occur under the following:
(1) For newly reconstructed roads, the moratorium period shall be five
years from such reconstruction.
(2) For newly milled and overlaid roads, the moratorium period shall
be three winters from such mill and overlay.
B. The Town through its Board of Selectmen may grant waivers under the
following but not limited to:
(1) Excavations to remedy a public emergency or a situation that
creates an imminent threat to the public safety, health, or welfare.
(2) Repair or modification to prevent interruption of essential utility
services where no reasonable alternatives are available to avoid
excavation in new pavements.
(3) Relocation work that is mandated by state or federal legislation.
(4) Utility services for new development, buildings, or parcels without
existing utility services where no other reasonable means of
providing services exists or which are identified in utility master
plans as determined by the Engineering Division.
(5) Excavations within streets under moratorium where reconstruction
is needed due to failure of original pavement.
C. In all of the above, if warranted and allowed, the applicant will pay an
additional pavement life reduction factor. This is calculated by the
following:
(1) Street pavement less than two years old: three times the street
damage charge.
(2) Street pavement two to five years old: two times street damage
charge; or
D. The Board of Selectmen as recommended by Municipal Services may
require full lane width mill and overlay for any trench that falls into this
category.
§ 252-21 SALEM CODE § 252-22
1:112
A. Pavement cutting. All bituminous concrete or concrete pavements shall
be cut before any excavation is started. The pavement shall be neatly
and uniformly saw cut at each side of all trenches to ensure against
unnecessary damage to pavement. An acceptable alternative to saw
cutting is cold planing.
B. Excavation. Excavation shall be performed in a manner as to produce
the minimum possible width of disturbance. Excavation and handling of
materials shall be performed in a manner as to minimize the possibility
of cave-ins. Sheeting and shoring shall be used in accordance with
OSHA requirements to prevent such undermining. Pavement projecting
over undermined areas shall be saw cut square and removed. No
opening or excavation in any street shall extend beyond the center line
of the street before the excavated side of the street is made passable to
traffic. Where a trench crosses a street, steel plates capable of bridging
the trench and supporting traffic may be used.
C. Backfill.
(1) Backfill material may consist of material excavated during the
course of construction if dry, but excluding pieces of pavement,
frozen material, organic matter, topsoil, muck, peat, clay, rocks
larger than six inches, or any other deleterious material that is
deemed unacceptable by the Engineering Division. If considered
unsuitable for backfill, excavated material shall be replaced with
granular backfill as specified in the "Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction," State of New Hampshire,
Department of Transportation (Sand-NHDOT 209.3 Gravel-NHDOT
209.4).
(2) Excavated material shall be replaced or backfilled in layers or
courses not to exceed 12 inches in compacted thickness; and shall
be compacted at or near optimum moisture content using
pneumatic tampers, vibratory compactors or other approved
means. Select materials immediately under the pavement (gravels
and processed gravels or reclaimed asphalt) shall be replaced in
kind or to a minimum depth of 12 inches of gravel and four inches
of crushed gravel meeting NHDOT Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction (Gravel NHDOT 304.2, Crushed
Gravel 304.3).
D. Compaction. All excavated materials shall be compacted to a minimum
of 95% of the optimum density (ASTM 1557 Method D). A compaction
test performed by a certified material testing laboratory may be
required. If required, the compaction test must be performed prior to
paving and the results submitted to the Engineering Division. If a
trench exceeds 100 feet in length, compaction tests shall be required
every 100 feet prior to paving.
§ 252-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-22
1:113
E. Work zone maintenance. The roadway shall be periodically swept to
remove materials from the traveled way. The roadway shall be cleaned
of all foreign materials at the end of each working day.
F. Trench restoration. A typical section for permanent pavement repair is
attached as a reference. In general these guidelines will be followed
accordingly with the Engineering Division making the final
determination on any variance in consideration of the application.
G. Bituminous trench patch. A temporary patch shall be placed using one
of the following methods:
(1) Temporary patch method one. Bituminous concrete binder course
will be brought to the surface grade at a minimum depth of 2 1/2
inches. This temporary patch will be maintained as necessary by
the contractor and allowed to remain in place for a minimum of 30
days but not more than 60 days (stabilization period). At the end of
the stabilization period the temporary patch will be cut out and the
trench trimmed with neat straight cuts and square corners a
minimum distance of 12 inches onto undisturbed material beyond
the limits of the temporary patch area or of the observed
settlement area, whichever is greater. The contractor will add or
remove crushed gravel and compact, if necessary.
(2) Temporary patch method two. The gravels shall be brought to the
appropriate grade and bituminous concrete binder course brought
to the surface grade. This temporary patch will be maintained as
necessary by the contractor and allowed to remain in place for a
minimum of 30 days but not more than 60 days (the stabilization
period). At the end of the stabilization period the temporary patch
will be milled to the depth of 1 1/2 inches a minimum distance of 12
inches onto undisturbed material beyond the limits of the
temporary patch area or of the observed settlement area,
whichever is greater.
H. Permanent patch shall be installed as follows:
(1) Temporary patch and existing pavement shall be removed in a
manner that results in no damage to adjacent pavement and shall
be replaced with an equal depth but not less than four inches (twoand-
five-tenths-inch binder course Type B and one-and-five-tenthsinch
wearing course Type F) of hot bituminous pavement
conforming to the standard specifications below.
(2) Limits of saw cuts or milling for final patching shall be approved by
the Engineering Division prior to execution of final paving. The
Town may require the limits of the area to increase due to any
damage in the work area.
(3) In the case of a transverse or diagonal trenching, the pavement
shall be cut to provide a diamond-shaped patch with at least twofoot
minimum overlap, four-foot in center if full width, of the final
§ 252-22 SALEM CODE § 252-22
1:114
patch onto undisturbed material that will permit only one wheel of
a vehicle at a time to strike the patch area.
(4) An approved asphalt emulsion (tack coat) shall be applied to the
face of all exposed joints of the existing pavement and between all
pavement lifts. Rolling shall be done with a self-propelled roller
weighing not less than eight tons to achieve ninety-five-percent
compaction and shall continue until a firm, even surface true to the
lines and grade is obtained.
(5) In cases where multiple excavations are made in a street which
would result in multiple patches, the Engineering Division at its
discretion may require a continuous patch or overlay across the
entire work zone.

ARTICLE I
Introduction
§ 270-1. Statutory authority.
This chapter is adopted under the authority granted to towns in RSA 31:39,
I(k), to license food service establishments pursuant to RSA 147:1, RSA 143
and RSA 143-A, as these laws exist and as they may be amended in the
future. On February 8, 1988, the Salem Board of Health adopted fees and
licensing categories referred to as Salem Chapter 196, Sanitary Food Code,
for all food service establishments pursuant to this authority. Revisions were
adopted on November 18, 1996. This chapter is based on NH He-P 2300,
New Hampshire Rules for the Sanitary Production and Distribution of Food,
adopted by the New Hampshire Legislature on March 26, 1998, and by the
Salem Board of Selectmen on October 19, 1998, as it exists and as it may
be amended in the future. In the event of differences in the two documents,
the more stringent shall apply.
[Note: On June 6, 1979, the New Hampshire Senate and House of
Representatives in General Court approved Chapter 173 (SB 226). This
bill established regulations for food service establishments in the Town of
Salem. This bill was adopted by the Town and went into effect on November
1, 1979. The Town later adopted Chapter 196, Sanitary Production and
Distribution of Food, which also incorporated the State Food Code, NH He-
P 2300, by reference. The State of New Hampshire adopted the 2009 FDA
Food Code in 2011. Due to the adoption by reference section in Chapter 196
(now Chapter 270), the Town of Salem enforces the Food Code regulations
as codified in the 2009 FDA Food Code.]
§ 270-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the health of the public

SALES, CASUAL
§ 382-1. Findings.
The Board of Selectmen, in an effort to recognize contemporary conditions
and in full recognition of the standards imposed by Chapter 490, Zoning,
of this Code, recognizes that certain casual uses of property within the
residential and rural zoning districts are not incompatible with the overall
intent as set forth in Chapter 490, Zoning, especially as that intent applies
to the conduct of business within those districts. Namely the Board of
Selectmen is of the opinion that the defined casual uses and activities may
be carried on in such districts by the resident/owner and not generally be
construed as incompatible with the applicable zoning of the district.
§ 382-2. Permitted sales.
Casual sales shall include:
A. The casual sale of household and personal items of the resident/owner
at his/her place of domicile. Any such sale shall be limited to a total
period of 36 hours covering not more than three calendar days in a
calendar year.93
B. Rummage sales and similar fund-raising efforts conducted by nonprofit
corporations registered with the New Hampshire Secretary of State, or
other organizations as in Subsection B(1) below.
(1) Organizations generally considered in this context are churches,
church-related organizations, local and national service clubs and
recognized service-oriented organizations.
(2) The conditions of § 382-3 shall apply.
C. Casual sales of automobiles, trailers, boats and similar items of
personal property.
(1) Such personal property must be personally owned by the resident/
owner or be of immediate family ownership, as evidenced by a title
or registration.

the application and must be acceptable to the Building Inspector.

stipulations felt excessive may be appealed to the Board of Selectmen.

inconsistent with the intent of casual sale and will not be
permitted (being contrary to the zoning requirements).
(b) Agents, dealers, brokers and salesmen are specifically
excluded from carrying out casual sales in their business
capacity under these regulations.
(2) Only one unregistered vehicle may be on the premises and offered

pretreatment standards or other pretreatment requirements. For the
purpose of this section, a significant violation is a violation which remains
uncorrected 45 days after notification of noncompliance, which is part of
a pattern of noncompliance over a twelve-month period, which involves a
failure to accurate report noncompliance, or which resulted in the POTW
exercising its emergency authority under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B).
A. Any person, firm, partnership or corporation found to be violating or in
violation of any provision of this chapter except § 398-7 shall be served
by the Town with written notice stating the nature of the violation and
providing a reasonable time limit as determined by the Town for the
satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of
time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations. The Town
may, after informal notice to the person discharging wastewater to the
public sewer, immediately halt or prevent any such discharge
reasonably appearing to present an imminent endangerment to the
health and welfare of persons or any discharge presenting, or which
may present, an endangerment to the environment, or which threatens
to interfere with the operation of the public sewer or wastewater
treatment facilities. Actions which may be taken by the Town include ex
parte temporary judicial injunctive relief, entry on private property to
halt such discharge, blockage of a public sewer to halt such discharge,
or demand of specific action by the person.
B. Fines for violation of the provisions of this chapter, as adopted by the
Board of Selectmen, are on file with the Town Manager and on the Town
of Salem website. Fines shall not exceed the maximum penalty
established pursuant to RSA 31:39, III.115

Connection to Storm Sewer System
[Adopted by the Board of Selectmen 1-29-1979 (Ch. 261, Art. I, of
the 1995 Code)]
§ 417-1. Procedure for requests to connect.
Any request to connect sump drains or basement drains to the municipal
storm drain system will be directed to the Town Engineer and the Public
Works Director, who, after on-site inspection and meeting with the
applicant, will submit a written recommendation to the Board of Selectmen
setting forth the nature of the application, the reason for it, potential
alternative solutions and their recommendation.
§ 417-2. Purpose.
Since drainage will undoubtedly be a matter of continuing concern, both
to the Town and to local residents, this procedure will provide for the
orderly disposition of requests as they occur, weighing the merits of each
on an individual basis rather than trying to address the matter with an
all-encompassing policy which, because of the individual nature of the
problems presented, will necessitate constant exceptions and bending of
the rules.

Standards for Acceptance
[Adopted by the Board of Selectmen 9-8-1975 (Ch. 275, Art. II, of
the 1995 Code); amended in its entirety at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 420-1. Purpose.
There being a large number of streets in Town which are not accepted,
nor acceptable, for reason of right-of-way widths and lack of proper
construction, and it being that current subdivision regulation requirements
for new streets should not be applicable to this type of street, the Selectmen
hereby adopt the following as minimum standards for unaccepted streets
that were existing at the time of adoption of this article and that met
applicable Planning Board regulations at the time of construction.
§ 420-2. Minimum right-of-way.
Before any street can be considered for acceptance and improvement, a
thirty-foot right-of-way must be available for dedication to the Town. If
such right-of-way is not currently available, abutting property owners must
convey sufficient land to the Town to fulfill this requirement, at no cost to
the Town. All necessary drainage easements must be granted. The right-ofway
shall be verified on the ground by a licensed surveyor prior to any work
by the Town. All costs, including but not limited to legal and engineering,
associated with any such dedication shall be borne by the petitioner(s).
§ 420-3. Construction details.
When deemed advisable by the Director of Engineering and the Director
of Public Works, the entire width of the right-of-way shall be cleared. All
stumps, peat and other unsuitable material shall be removed from the limits
of the roadbed. The minimum roadbed width shall be 20 feet, and the
minimum pavement width shall be 16 feet. The roadbed shall be constructed
of 12 inches of bank-run gravel and four inches of crushed gravel. Adequate
drainage of the road to ensure its preservation shall be installed. The
road surface shall consist of a minimum thickness of four inches of hot
bituminous concrete, machine placed in two courses consisting of a binder
course of 2.5 inches and one-inch wearing course, or other more stringent
standard as deemed appropriate by the Engineering Department.
§ 420-4. Improvement to be to residency limits; future extension.
The street will be improved only to the limits of residency at the time of
improvement. Later improvements would be at the expense of abutters, the
work being to the above standards if done by a private contractor. In cases
where long gaps exist between residences and improvements are made
fronting vacant lots, a betterment charge per linear foot, as determined by
the Board of Selectmen, will be paid by owners of said lots before building
permits will be issued for the same. A gap exceeding the legal zoning
§ 420-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 420-4
1:375
frontage of one lot within the district in which the lot is located on either
side of the street shall be considered the basis for such charges.
§ 420-5. Existing substandard streets in new subdivisions.
Developers of new subdivisions which require passage over existing
substandard streets for access to the new street may be required to improve
such streets to the minimum standard specified in the Planning Board
Subdivision Regulations then in effect.

Snow Removal on Unaccepted Roads
[Adopted by the Board of Selectmen 12-12-1977 (Ch. 275, Art. III,
of the 1995 Code)]
§ 420-6. Statement of conditions.
Annually, the Town is faced with more miles of roads, particularly in new
subdivisions, that have not been accepted in the legal sense. In addition,
the Town has several miles of roads that have never been legally accepted
and do not meet present minimum standards that will qualify them for
consideration of acceptance.
§ 420-7. Present policy generally.116
Presently, the Town provides minimal maintenance in the interest of public
safety but is no longer able, under law, to expend any public funds on such
roads.
§ 420-8. Statement of policy.117
The Selectmen hereby reaffirm the Town's basic policy on this matter as
follows:
A. Existing unaccepted roads with or without an all-weather surface and
having year-round residents shall be plowed, sanded and salted during
the winter season for public safety purposes by the abutters of these
private roads.
B. New unaccepted roads with some all-weather surface and built to the
required Planning Board standards, having year-round occupancy and/
or use, shall be plowed, sanded and salted during the winter season for
public safety purposes by the developer thereof.
C. Any winter maintenance performed by the Town on private roads shall
be at the expense of the abutters and/or owner(s) of said private roads.

UTILITY DEMAND AND BENEFIT ASSESSMENTS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Sewer use  See Ch. 398. Water  See Ch. 477.
§ 455-1. Authority.
This policy is adopted pursuant to RSA 38:28, RSA 38:27 and RSA 149-I:7
and Chapters 398 and 477 of the Town Code.
§ 455-2. Purpose.
The Board of Selectmen realizes the broad scope of the water and sewer
system projects throughout the community and the need to continually
manage, construct, enlarge, acquire, extend, and make improvements to
the systems for continued reliability and availability of the systems to
provide special benefit to those who are and may be served by such utility
systems. Further the Board recognizes the general benefit to the customers
of the municipal utility systems of sharing in the cost of extending system
services to areas of the community not yet serviced and the resulting benefit
provided to landowners by the availability of municipal water and sewer
service. Therefore the purpose of this chapter is to provide high-quality,
available and reasonably reliable water and sewer resources, to the benefit
of current and future users, as funded through the combination of the user
rate and reasonable and equitable assessments across all user types, by
assessing those creating a new demand through new connections and/or
modifying the demand of an existing connection to the Town of Salem public
water system and/or the public sanitary sewer system.
§ 455-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AVAILABILITY  The presence of a reasonably reliable and quality water
and sewer system to the extent that such system provides special benefit
and is made or can be made available to those who are or will benefit from
such systems. The obligation to provide accessibility to the water and sewer
systems shall not solely be the obligation of the Town.
BENEFIT  The advantage, enhancement, and/or facilitation of use or
development derived from the availability of sewer and water services
throughout the community and specifically to parcels that currently or in
the future will be permitted to connect to the sewer and water system.
CONSTRUCTION COSTS  The sum of all costs incurred for the utility
extension, including design, engineering, right-of-way acquisition,
§ 436-5 SALEM CODE § 455-3
1:418
construction, construction supervision, traffic control, legal and bonding
expenses, interest on debt and other reasonable ancillary expenses.
COST OF DEMAND AND AVAILABILITY  The cost of the increase in
demand and to provide reasonable availability as expressed by the projects
in the document "Town of Salem, NH Town-wide Sewer and Water Buildout
Estimated Costs and Demand Flows." This document represents the
estimated total cost of projects and the estimated increases in capacity to
allow for demand and provide for reasonable and continual availability. The
document may be amended from time to time as projects are amended,
completed, or added to the document. The document represents projects
that have been, are or will be planned as part of a Town-wide plan for
the water and sewer systems and not the sole limit of the possible use of
revenues generated by this chapter.
DEMAND  The projected flow/discharge of water or sewer to/from a
particular land use as indicated by the document titled "Town of Salem Flow
Demand and Benefit Values." Where a use is proposed that is not listed
in the document, the Town may determine that the use is similar to a use
listed in the document or the Town may use national or other reasonable
standards to make such determination.
NOT BUILDABLE  Not eligible for a building permit at the time a utility
extension occurs.
PARCEL  A parcel of land, otherwise known as a "lot," that is privately
owned and segregated by deed from adjacent properties.
SERVICE  A waterline extending from a water distribution main, or a
sewer line ("stub") extending from a sewer collector main, to a point at or
near the property line of a parcel.
SEWER DEMAND AND BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  The revenue collected
from those who derive special benefit from the sewer system to pay for
the cost of the demand on, and provide availability to, the Town of Salem's
sewer system, including the management, creation, improvement,
extension and expansion of wastewater collection and treatment, pumping,
and all other facilities that generally provide for collection and treatment of
sewage.
SYSTEM-WIDE BENEFIT  Benefit derived from projects, construction,
enhancements, expansion, utility extensions or other improvements which
can be attributed to the entire water and/or sewer system and are
distinguishable from improvements which are attributable to the planned
improvements made for the benefit of a parcel or parcels. The Town may
determine and allocate a portion of the value of improvements to a systemwide
benefit.
TOWN  The Town of Salem, Rockingham County, New Hampshire, a
municipality of the State of New Hampshire, acting by and through its
Selectmen with the Town Manager serving as their designee.
USER FEES  Fees charged to individual customers for their measured use
of a service or consumption of a product.
§ 455-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 455-3
1:419
UTILITY EXTENSION  Extension of an existing water or sewer main
beyond the then current extent of the system so as to make service available
to the abutters to the extension.
WATER DEMAND AND BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  The revenue collected
from those who derive special benefit from the sewer system to pay for
the cost of the demand on, and availability of, the Town of Salem's water
facilities, including the management, creation, improvement, extension and
expansion of treatment, pumping, storage, protection of supply, and
transmission facilities that generally provide water to the local distribution
networks.
§ 455-4. Policy and payment.
A. Demand and benefit assessment established. Water and sewer demand
and benefit assessments are hereby established and may be revised
from time to time by the Board of Selectmen. The application of this
chapter shall be required of all applicable properties coinciding with
the date of the adoption.
B. Assessment payment to be made. Payment is considered as made at the
time, manner and form as established by the Town Finance
Department. Payment shall include the option of a lump sum payment
or the establishment of a payment plan in accordance with the terms
and conditions established by the Town.
C. Payment options. The payment options are pursuant to the Town
procedures. In the event of the sale or transfer of the assessed premises
by the owner, the obligations established shall transfer to the successor
owner. As provided for in RSA 38:22, the Town may place a lien on the
property for nonpayment of the demand and benefit assessment.
D. Assessment allocation of demand and benefit.
(1) The cost of expanding the system to those areas of Salem where it
is economically appropriate has been estimated based on design
and economic analyses. The increase in demand for water supply
and demand on the capacity of the existing sewer system has also
been estimated. The cost of providing a unit of capacity of water
supply, or a unit of capacity of wastewater disposal, has been
determined from those capacity and cost estimates. The unit
capital cost of water supply, treatment capacity, and distribution
has been determined as a dollar value per gallon per day of water
delivery capacity. The unit capital cost for wastewater collection
and transmission facilities has been determined as a dollar value
per gallon per day of demand. Based on these values the following
is the allocation of costs as expressed by the document titled "Town
of Salem, NH Town-wide Sewer and Water Buildout Estimated
Costs and Demand Flows":
(a) Fifty percent of the capital cost for water and sewer service
will be assessed to those who are newly served by the water
§ 455-3 SALEM CODE § 455-4
1:420
§ 455-5. Charges.
and sewer system, and to those who increase their demand
on the system, based on the unit cost for providing water
supply and wastewater disposal capacity to meet the increased
demand. Each user of new or increased capacity will be
assessed a charge based on the demand required by that user,
as expressed by the document titled "Flow Demand and Benefit
Values" and the unit capital cost to provide that capacity or
meet that demand.
(b) Fifty percent of the capital cost for providing new or increased
water or sewer service will be paid by water and sewer rate
revenues that are based on the amount of water withdrawn
from or wastewater discharged to the system by all of the
customers connected to the system.
(2) Recognizing that it is not possible to exactly balance the capital
cost expenditure and assessment revenue at all times, the capital
costs and debt service not paid by the assessments will be paid
from water and sewer rate revenues. It is intended and expected
that, over the duration of the debt service period for the
construction programs, the assessments and allocations of costs
will approximate the intended ratios. Notwithstanding the
references to water and sewer rates together in this section, the
water and sewer funds are and will remain separate and the
assessments for each are determined separately.
E. Wavier for related assessments. Waivers from this chapter, whether
now or in the future, may be allowed for a property or properties with
payment agreements with the Town, as part of the overall Town-wide
water and/or sewer projects, or as an agreement between the Town, as
recognized and established through the Board of Selectmen, and
resident property owners, for construction of water and/or sewer
infrastructure. Such waiver may be granted by a vote of the Board of
Selectmen at a public meeting. The wavier shall apply to the one
agreement and/or prior payments for the specific properties which are
part of said payment agreement or other agreements and not future
extensions, expansions or changes to the property or properties. Upon
request by the Board of Selectmen, the Finance Department shall
determine applicable projects defined by a betterment and/or
agreement and shall supply a list of applicable properties to the Board
for consideration of the waiver.132
A. Assessment for new users. The owner of any land or structure which
connects to or is within an area of an available utility extension of the
Town sewer and/or water system shall pay a water and/or sewer
demand and benefit assessment as applicable at the time of application
for the certificate of occupancy pursuant to municipal codes herein.
132. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 455-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 455-5
1:421
Where the new connection does not require a certificate of occupancy,
then assessment shall occur at the time that the water and/or sewer is
made available to the property. Properties served by utility extensions
conducted by private concerns without Town funds shall be charged
a demand and benefit assessment at the time of the certificate of
occupancy or connection. In all cases there shall be a minimum charge
in accordance with the document "Flow Demand and Benefit Values."133
B. Assessment for changes in use. If change in use as defined by the
document "Flow Demand and Benefit Values" is reasonably expected to
increase the demand on water consumption and sewer discharge, then
the owner of the structure shall pay an additional water and/or sewer
demand and benefit assessment based on the increase in the demand as
compared to the prior use or expansion to the new use or expansion.
The change in the use of the land and/or structure shall be determined
to occur at the time of application for the certificate of occupancy for
such change. Where the change may not require a certificate of
occupancy the change shall be considered to occur at the time of
change of use or other like permit from the Town of Salem.134
C. Assessment for change in operations/equipment. If change, alteration
or modification in equipment, area and/or operations, for a commercial
account, is reasonably expected to increase the demand on water
consumption and sewer discharge by 10% over the average flow in the
highest billing period, then the Town shall assess the owner an
additional water and/or sewer demand and benefit assessment based on
the increase in the demand as measured from the prior billing period.
For the purpose of this section, increase in demand shall not include
increase or peaks associated with accidental increase by emergency
circumstances which result in the release of water or inflow into the
sewer.
D. Credits in lieu of system improvements. Where as a condition of the
Town for making connections to the sewer and/or water system the
property owner, developer, or other representative makes
improvements to the water and/or sewer system within the public
domain, and where the improvement is determined by the Town to be of
a system-wide benefit to the water and/or sewer system and not directly
related or attributed only to the development, such improvement may
be used as a direct credit to lower the amount of the initial demand and
benefit assessment. The credit may not be applied to other projects
throughout the community and is limited to the original project from
which the system-wide improvements resulted. The amount of such
credit, as approved by the Town, shall be based on the completed
construction costs for those system-wide improvements only. Such
determination shall be reviewed and certified by the Town, which may
use reasonable standards and make modifications and amendments to
133. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).

the construction costs. The Town may allow for system-wide
construction credit that may occur within five years of the first
connection where the Town requests a delay in the system-wide
construction. Such credits shall serve to lower the obligation of the
initial assessment and shall not be distributed as a payment or refund.
The Town will not provide direct payments for credits that are greater
than the demand and benefit assessment. Approval of credits shall
occur by a petition filed by the property owner or duly authorized
representative and through a public hearing before the Board of
Selectmen, with evidence in the manner and form as prescribed by the
Town. The Board of Selectmen in reaching its determination may hire
consultants at a reasonable cost to be borne by the petitioner.
E. Petition for adjustment of assessment. If within one year of the payment
of the first demand and benefit assessment charge the property owner,
of property with a commercial account, with a petition to a public
hearing of the Board of Selectmen can prove that the use of the
property is less than the demand as defined by the Town of Salem, the
Board may choose to adjust the assessment. The Board of Selectmen in
reaching its determination may hire consultants at a reasonable cost to
be borne by the petitioner.
F. Reduction refunds not issued. Notwithstanding Subsection E above, no
refund of a demand and benefit assessment will be issued by the Town
on account of reduction in the consumption of water or sewer demand.
G. Town demand review. The Town reserves the right at any time to review
demand on the water and/or sewer system placed by properties, and if
as a result of the review the Town finds increases, the Town may choose
to levy an assessment as deemed appropriate.
H. Municipal exemption. This chapter shall not apply to the facilities of the
Town of Salem, its municipal and school departments, and Towncreated
public bodies as identified on a list approved, and as may be
amended, by the Board of Selectmen at a regular meeting. (Note:
Referenced list is on file with the Board of Selectmen.)
A. Assessment regardless of connection. Except as otherwise specified in
this section, a service shall be installed to service each parcel of land
abutting newly constructed utility extensions. Each parcel so serviced
shall have a demand and benefit assessment applied regardless of a
connection status. In the case of private utility extension which is not
funded by the Town, the Board may allow demand and benefit
assessment at the time of connection where the properties are
incidental to the route and not part of the development plans.
B. Subdividable parcels. Where frontage is sufficient to support
subdivision along the street, a sufficient number of services may be
§ 455-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 455-6
1:423
§ 455-7. Procedure for Town utility extensions.
installed at the owner's request to service future parcels. Each service
shall constitute a separate assessment.
C. Large land tracts. Where large tracts of land abut the utility extension,
owners may be granted larger than typical services for which they shall
be required to pay the incremental difference in cost thereof prior to
installation. The Town reserves the right to reject requests it deems
inappropriate. Should the size of the service requested be unsuitable
for actual development at a later date, then the full costs of changing
the size or type of the service shall be borne by the property owner.
D. Nonbuildable parcels. A property owner may petition the Board to
request a determination that his property is impacted in such a way by
zoning, wetlands, topography, or other fundamental restrictions to
render it not buildable. The Board may act to remove the property from
requiring a demand and benefit assessment, provided that the property
owner enters onto his deed in perpetuity a development restriction
acceptable to the Board. The Town reserves the right to reject requests
it deems inappropriate. If a request for a service to a parcel originally
deemed nonbuildable is made after the utility improvement
construction has passed by the subject property, such a service shall be
installed and the full cost of the connection shall be born by the owner
who shall also pay a demand and benefit assessment.
E. Assessment term. Such parcel assessments shall be billed in equal
portions annually for a period of time equal to the term of the related
debt, but not longer than 20 years. In the event no debt is incurred, the
Board shall set a reasonable term. Such bills shall be issued in
accordance with Town policies.
F. Recording required. Demand and benefit assessments shall be recorded
in the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds and shall serve as a lien on
the assessed property as provided for in RSA 38:22. The recorded
document shall stipulate that upon the transfer of a parcel bearing a
demand and benefit assessment, the unpaid portion of the assessment
shall also transfer to the new owner.
A. Notices to owners. Owners of property shall be notified by mail of the
utility extension at least 120 days prior to the availability of service.
Owner requests for correction to the property status indicated by the
Town and/or alternate service installations shall be in writing and
received by the Town not more than 30 days after receipt of such
notification. Such requests shall be subject to evaluation by the Town.
B. Utility extension extent. The Board shall determine the geographic
extent of the utility extension in which it intends to apply demand and
benefit assessments applicable to each parcel. Inclusion of a planned
utility extension in a statutory bond or budget hearing shall constitute
compliance with this section.135

mutually agreed appointment to take applications and to conduct
ongoing case management when necessary for applicants who
cannot leave their homes;
(11) The requirement of placing a lien on any real property owned by
the recipient, or any civil judgments or property settlements, for
any assistance given, except for good cause;
(12) The fact that reimbursement from the recipient will be sought if he/
she becomes able to repay the amount of assistance given; and
(13) The applicant's right to review the guidelines.
C. Responsibility of each applicant and recipient.
(1) At the time of initial application, and at all times thereafter, the
applicant/recipient has the following responsibilities:
(a) To provide accurate, complete and current information
concerning needs and resources and the whereabouts and
§ 482-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-5
1:463
circumstances of relatives who may be responsible under RSA
165:19;
(b) To notify the welfare official promptly when there is a change
in needs, resources, address or household size;
(c) To apply for immediately, but no later than seven days from
initial application, and accept any benefits or resources, public
or private, that will reduce or eliminate the need for general
assistance. RSA 165:1-b, I(d);
(d) To keep all appointments as scheduled;
(e) To provide records and other pertinent information and access
to said records and information when requested;
(f) To provide a doctor's statement if claiming an inability to work
due to medical problems;
(g) Following a determination of eligibility for assistance, to
diligently search for employment and provide verification of
work search (the number of work search contacts to be
determined by the welfare official), to accept employment
when offered [except for documented reasons of good cause
(RSA 165:1-d)], and to maintain such employment. RSA
165:1-b, I(c);
(h) Following a determination of eligibility for assistance, to
participate in the work program if physically and mentally
able. RSA 165:1-b, I(b); and
(i) To reimburse assistance granted if returned to an income
status and if such reimbursement can be made without
financial hardship. RSA 165:20-b.
(2) An applicant shall be denied assistance if he/she fails to fulfill any
of these responsibilities without reasonable justification. A
recipient's assistance may be terminated or suspended for failure
to fulfill any of these responsibilities without reasonable
justification, in accordance with § 482-12C.
(3) Any recipient may be denied or terminated from general
assistance, in accordance with § 482-12, or may be prosecuted for a
criminal offense, if he/she, by means of intentionally false
statements or intentional misrepresentation, or by impersonation
or other willfully fraudulent act or device, obtains or attempts to
obtain any assistance to which he/she is not entitled.
D. Actions on applications.
(1) Decision. Unless an application is withdrawn, the welfare official
shall make a decision concerning the applicant's eligibility
immediately, in the case of emergency, or within five working days
§ 482-5 SALEM CODE § 482-5
1:464
after submission of the application. A written notice of decision
shall be given in hand, delivered or mailed on the same day or next
working day following the making of the decision. The notice of
decision shall state that assistance of a specific kind and amount
has been given and the time period of aid, or that the application
has been denied, in whole or in part, with reasons for denial. A
decision may also be made to pend an application subject to receipt
of specified information from the applicant. The notice of decision
shall contain a first notice of conditions for continued assistance
and shall notify the applicant of his/her right to a fair hearing if
dissatisfied with the welfare official's decision. RSA 165:1-b, II and
III.
(2) Emergency assistance. If, at the time of initial contact, the
applicant demonstrates and verifies that an immediate need exists,
because of which the applicant may suffer a loss of a basic
necessity of living or imminent threat to life or health (such as loss
of shelter, utilities or heat or lack of food or prescriptions), then
temporary aid to fill such immediate need shall be given
immediately, pending a decision on the application. Such
emergency assistance shall not obligate the welfare official to
provide further assistance after the application process is
completed.
(3) Temporary assistance. In circumstances where required records
are not available, the welfare official may give temporary approval
of an application pending receipt of required documents.
Temporary status shall not extend beyond two weeks. The welfare
official shall not insist on documentary verification if such records
are totally unavailable.
(4) Withdrawn applications. An application shall be considered
withdrawn if:
(a) The applicant has refused to complete an application or has
refused to make a good faith effort to provide required
verifications and sufficient information for the completion of an
application. If an application is deemed withdrawn for these
reasons, the welfare official shall so notify the applicant in a
written notice of decision;
(b) The applicant dies before assistance is rendered;
(c) The applicant avails him/herself of other resources to meet the
need in place of assistance;
(d) The applicant requests that the application be withdrawn
(preferably in writing); or
(e) The applicant does not contact the welfare official after the
initial interview after being requested to do so.
§ 482-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-5
1:465
§ 482-6. Verification of information.
Any determination or investigation of need or eligibility shall be conducted
in a manner that will not violate the privacy or personal dignity of the
individual or harass or violate his or her individual rights.
E. Home visits.
(1) A home visit may be made by appointment at the request of any
applicant only when it is impossible for the applicant or his or her
representative to apply in person.
(2) The home visit shall be conducted in such a manner as to preserve,
to the greatest extent possible, the privacy and dignity of the
applicant. To this end, the person conducting the visit shall not be
in uniform or travel in a law enforcement vehicle, shall be polite
and courteous, and shall not knowingly discuss or mention the
application within the listening area of someone who is not a
member of the household.
A. Required verifications. Verification will normally be required of the
following:
(1) Applicant's address;
(2) Facts relevant to the applicant's residence, as set forth in §§ 482-8B
and 482-9;
(3) Names of persons in applicant's residential unit;
(4) Applicant's and household's income and assets;
(5) Applicant's and household's financial obligations;
(6) The physical and mental condition of household members, only
where relevant to their receipt of assistance, such as ability to
work, determination of needs, or referrals to other forms of
assistance;
(7) Any special circumstances claimed by applicant;
(8) Applicant's employment status and availability in the labor market;
(9) Names, addresses, and employment status of potentially liable
relatives;
(10) Utility costs;
(11) Housing costs;
(12) Prescription costs; and
(13) Any other costs that the applicant wishes to claim as a necessity.
§ 482-5 SALEM CODE § 482-6
1:466
§ 482-7. Disbursements.
B. Verification records. Verification may be made through records
provided by the applicant (for example, birth and marriage certificates,
pay stubs, pay checks, rent receipts, bankbooks, bank statements, etc.)
as primary sources. The failure of the applicant to bring such records
does not affect the welfare official's responsibility to process the
application promptly. The welfare official shall inform the applicant
what records are necessary, and the applicant is required to produce
records possessed as soon as possible. However, the welfare official
shall not insist on documentary verification if such records are not
available, but should ask the applicant to suggest alternative means of
verification.
C. Other sources of verification. Verification may also be made through
other sources, such as relatives, employers, former employers, banks,
school personnel, and social or government agencies. The cashier of a
national bank or a treasurer of a savings and trust company is
authorized by law to furnish information regarding amounts deposited
to the credit of an applicant or recipient. RSA 165:4.
D. Written consent of applicant. When information is sought from such
other sources, the welfare official shall explain to the applicant or
recipient what information is desired, how it will be used, and the
necessity of obtaining it in order to establish eligibility. Before contact
is made with any other source, the welfare official shall obtain written
consent of the applicant or recipient, unless the welfare official has
reasonable grounds to suspect fraud. In the case of suspected fraud, the
welfare official shall carefully record his/her reasons and actions, and
before any accusation or confrontation is made, the applicant shall be
given an opportunity to explain or clarify the suspicious circumstances.
E. Legally liable relatives. The welfare official may seek statements from
the applicant's legally liable relatives regarding their ability to help
support the applicant.
F. Refusal to verify information. Should the applicant or recipient refuse
comment and/or indicate an unwillingness to have the welfare official
seek further information that is necessary, assistance may be denied for
lack of eligibility verification.
A. The municipality pays in a voucher system (RSA 165:1, III). Vouchers
are payable directly to the vendors (utilities, landlords, stores, etc.)
involved. Landlords are verified through the application process and
notified in written decisions.
B. The amount shown on the voucher is the maximum amount to be used
for payment. In accordance with the municipality's accounting
practices, a recipient may be required to sign the voucher to ensure
proper usage. The vendor returns the voucher with the required
documentation, for payment, to the welfare official. After the initial
§ 482-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-7
1:467
§ 482-8. Determination of eligibility and amount.
transaction, if there is any unspent money, the voucher shall be
returned to the municipality for payment of the actual amount listed on
an itemized bill or register tape. Vouchers altered by the recipient or
vendor may not be honored.
A. Eligibility formula. An applicant is eligible to receive assistance when:
(1) He/she meets the nonfinancial eligibility factors listed in
Subsection C below; and
(2) The applicant's basic maintenance need, as determined under
Subsection E below, exceeds his/her available income (Subsection
F below) plus available liquid assets (Subsection D below). If
available income and available liquid assets exceed the basic
maintenance need (as determined by the guideline amounts), the
applicant is not eligible for general assistance. If the need exceeds
the available income/assets, the amount of assistance granted to
the applicant shall be the difference between the two amounts, in
the absence of circumstances deemed by the welfare official to
justify an exception.
B. Legal standard and interpretation. "Whenever a person in any town is
poor and unable to support himself, he shall be relieved and maintained
by the overseers of public welfare of such town, whether or not he has
residence there." RSA 165:1.
(1) An applicant cannot be denied assistance because he/she is not a
resident. See § 482-9.
(2) "Whenever" means at any or whatever time that person is poor and
unable to support him/herself.
(a) The welfare official, or a person authorized to act on his/her
behalf, shall be available during normal business hours.
(b) The eligibility of any applicant for general assistance shall be
determined no later than five working days after the
application is submitted. If the applicant has an emergency
need, then assistance for such emergency need shall be
immediately provided in accordance with § 482-5D(1) and (2).
(c) Assistance shall begin as soon as the applicant is determined to
be eligible.
(3) "Poor and unable to support" means that an individual lacks income
and available liquid assets to adequately provide for the basic
maintenance needs of him/herself or family as determined by the
guidelines.
(4) "Relieved" means an applicant shall be assisted to meet those basic
needs.
§ 482-7 SALEM CODE § 482-8
1:468
C. Nonfinancial eligibility factors.
(1) Age. General assistance cannot be denied any applicant because of
the applicant's age; age is not a factor in determining whether or
not an applicant may receive general assistance. Minor children
are assumed to be the responsibility of their parent(s) or legal
guardian(s), unless circumstances warrant otherwise.
(2) Support actions. No applicant or recipient shall be compelled, as a
condition of eligibility or continued receipt of assistance, to take
any legal action against any other person. The municipality may
pursue recovery against legally liable persons or governmental
units. See § 482-15.
(3) Eligibility for other categorical assistance. Recipients who are, or
may be, eligible for any other form of public assistance must apply
for such assistance immediately, but no later than seven days after
being advised to do so by the welfare official. Failure to do so may
render the recipient ineligible for assistance and subject to action
pursuant to § 482-12 of these guidelines.
(4) Employment. An applicant who is gainfully employed, but whose
income and assets are not sufficient to meet necessary household
expenses, may be eligible to receive general assistance. However,
recipients who without good cause refuse a job offer or referral to
suitable employment or participation in the work program, or who
voluntarily leave a job without good cause, may be ineligible for
continuing general assistance in accordance with the procedures
for suspension outlined in the guidelines. The welfare official shall
first determine whether there is good cause for such refusal, taking
into account the ability and physical and mental capacity of the
applicant, transportation problems, working conditions that might
involve risks to health or safety, lack of adequate child care, or any
other factors that might make refusing a job reasonable. These
employment requirements shall extend to all adult members of the
household.
(5) Registration with the New Hampshire Department of Employment
Security (NHES) and work search requirements.
(a) All unemployed recipients and adult members of their
households shall, within seven days after having been granted
assistance, register with NHES to find work and must conduct
a reasonable, verified job search as determined by the welfare
official. Each recipient must apply for employment to each
employer to whom he/she is referred by the welfare official.
These work search requirements apply unless the recipient
and each other adult member of the household is:
[1] Gainfully employed full-time;
§ 482-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-8
1:469
[2] A dependent 18 or under who is regularly attending
secondary school;
[3] Unable to work due to illness or mental or physical
disability of him/herself or another member of the
household, as verified by the welfare official; or
[4] Solely responsible for the care of a child under the age of
five (RSA 165:31, III). A recipient responsible for the care
of a child aged five to 12 shall not be excused from work
search requirements but shall be deemed to have good
cause to refuse a job requiring work during hours the child
is not usually in school, if there is no responsible person
available to provide care, and it is verified by the welfare
official that no other care is available.
(b) The welfare official shall give all necessary and reasonable
assistance to ensure compliance with registration and work
requirements, including the granting of allowances for
transportation and work clothes. Failure of a recipient to
comply with these requirements without good cause will be
reason for denial of assistance.
(6) Students. Applicants who are college students not available for or
refusing to seek full-time employment are not eligible for general
assistance.
(7) Noncitizens. The welfare officer may, in his/her sole discretion,
provide limited assistance to noncitizens not otherwise eligible for
general assistance.
(a) A noncitizen who is not a qualified alien under 8 U.S.C.A.
§ 1641, a nonimmigrant under the federal Immigration and
Nationality Act, or an alien paroled into the United States for
less than one year under 8 U.S.C.A. § 1182(d)(5) is not eligible
for general assistance from the municipality. 8 U.S.C.A.
§ 1621(a).
(b) Qualified aliens include aliens who are lawfully admitted for
permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality
Act (8 U.S.C.A. § 1101 et seq.), aliens who are granted asylum
under that act, certain refugees, and certain battered aliens. 8
U.S.C.A. § 1641.
(c) A noncitizen who is not eligible for general assistance may be
eligible for state assistance with health care items and services
that are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical
condition, which is defined as a medical condition (including
emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute
symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such
that the absence of immediate medical attention could
reasonably be expected to result in:
§ 482-8 SALEM CODE § 482-8
1:470
[1] Placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy;
[2] Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
[3] Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. 8 U.S.C.A.
§ 1621(b) and 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396b(v)(3).160
(d) A noncitizen may also be eligible for general assistance for
treatment of an emergency medical condition, pursuant to
§ 482-8E(8)(a) of these guidelines.
(e) Noncitizen applicants for general assistance may be required
to provide proof of eligibility.
(8) Property transfers. No applicant who is otherwise eligible shall
receive such assistance if he/she has made an assignment, transfer,
or conveyance of property for the purpose of rendering him/herself
eligible for assistance within three years immediately preceding
his/her application. RSA 165:2-b.
(9) Employment of household members.
(a) The employment requirements of these guidelines, or
participation in the workfare program, shall be required for all
adults aged 18 to 65 years residing in the same household,
except those regularly attending secondary school or employed
on a full-time basis, who are:
[1] Members of the recipient's household;
[2] Legally liable to contribute to the support of the recipient
and/or children of the household; and
[3] Not prevented from maintaining employment and
contributing to the support of the household by reason of
physical or mental disability or other justifiable cause as
verified by the welfare official.
(b) The welfare official may waive this requirement where failure
of the other household members to comply is not the fault of
the recipient and the welfare official decides it would be
unreasonable for the recipient to establish a separate
household. RSA 165:32.
(10) Disqualification for voluntary termination of employment.
(a) Any applicant eligible for assistance who voluntarily
terminated employment shall be ineligible to receive
assistance for 90 days from the date of employment
termination, provided that the applicant:
[1] Has received local welfare within the past 365 days;
160. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 482-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-8
1:471
[2] Has been given notice that voluntary termination of
employment without good cause could result in
disqualification;
[3] Has terminated employment of at least 20 hours per week
without good cause within 60 days of an application for
local welfare;
[4] Is not responsible for supporting minor children in his/her
household; and
[5] Did not have a mental or physical impairment which
caused him/her to be unable to work.
(b) Good cause for terminating employment shall include any of
the following: discrimination, unreasonable work demands or
unsuitable employment, retirement, leaving a job in order to
accept a bona fide job offer, migrant farm labor or seasonal
construction, and lack of transportation or child care. An
applicant shall be considered to have voluntarily terminated
employment if the applicant fails to report for work without
good cause. An applicant who is fired or resigns from a job at
the request of the employer due to applicant's inability to
maintain the employer's normal work productivity standard
shall not be considered to have voluntarily terminated
employment. RSA 165:1-d.
D. Available assets.
(1) Available liquid assets. Cash on hand, bank deposits, credit union
accounts, securities and retirement plans (i.e., IRAs, deferred
compensation, Keoghs, etc.) are available liquid assets. Insurance
policies with a loan value and nonessential personal property may
be considered as available liquid assets when they have been
converted into cash. The welfare official shall allow a reasonable
time for such conversion. However, tools of a trade, livestock and
farm equipment, and necessary and ordinary household goods are
essential items of personal property which shall not be considered
as available assets.
(2) Automobile ownership. The ownership of one automobile by an
applicant/recipient or his/her dependent does not affect eligibility if
it is essential for transportation to seek or maintain employment, to
procure medical services or rehabilitation services, or if its use is
essential to the maintenance of the individual or the family.
(3) Insurance. The ownership of insurance policies does not affect
eligibility. However, when a policy has cash or loan value, the
recipient will be required to obtain and/or borrow all available
funds, which shall then be considered available liquid assets.
§ 482-8 SALEM CODE § 482-8
1:472
(4) Real estate. The type and amount of real estate owned by an
applicant does not affect eligibility, although rent or other such
income from property shall be considered as available to meet
need. Applicants owning real estate property, other than that
occupied as their primary residence, shall be expected to make
reasonable efforts to dispose of it at fair market value. Applicants
shall be informed that a lien covering the amount of any general
assistance they receive shall be placed against any real estate they
own. RSA 165:28.
E. Standard of need. The basic financial requirement for general
assistance is that an applicant be poor and unable to support him/
herself. An applicant shall be considered poor when he/she has
insufficient available income/assets to purchase either for him/herself
or dependents any of the following:
(1) Shelter. The amount to be included as "need" for shelter is the
actual cost of rent or mortgage necessary to provide shelter in that
municipality for the current month, or other rental period if
deemed appropriate by the welfare official. All requests for rental
or mortgage assistance will be reviewed based on a consideration
of the applicant's ability to pay future rent or mortgage payments.
(a) Shelter arrearages. Shelter arrearages will be included in the
"need" formula if, and only if, such payment is necessary to
prevent eviction or foreclosure or to protect the health and
safety of the household. However, if the amount of such
mortgage or rental arrearage substantially exceeds the cost of
alternative, available housing which complies with local health
and housing code standards, or if the payment of arrears will
not prevent eviction or foreclosure, the welfare official may
instead authorize payment of security deposit, rent, and/or
reasonable relocation expenses for such alternative housing if,
under the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to do so
and would not cause undue hardship to the applicant
household. Alternative housing may include transitional
housing as an option.
(b) Security deposits. Security deposits may be included in the
"need" formula if, and only if, the applicant is unable to secure
alternative shelter for which no security deposit is required or
is unable to secure funds, either him/herself or from
alternative sources, for payment of the deposit. Any security
deposit provided by the general assistance program which is
returned under RSA 540-A:7 shall be returned to the
municipality, not the recipient.
(c) Relative landlords. Whenever a relative of an applicant is also
the landlord for the applicant, a financial analysis of the
landlord shall be made in accordance with RSA 165:19.
§ 482-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-8
1:473
Otherwise, an applicant is not eligible for rental assistance if
the landlord is a parent.
(d) Storage. Storage charges are not an eligible shelter expense
under the basic needs formula, unless the applicant is
homeless.
(2) Utilities. When utility costs are not included in the shelter expense,
the most recent outstanding monthly utility bill in the name of the
applicant will be included as part of "need" by the welfare official.
Arrearages will not normally be included in "need" except as set
forth below.
NOTE: The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (PUC)
has established comprehensive rules governing the provision of
some utility services. Generally speaking, the PUC governs electric,
telephone, water, and sewer; it does not govern any municipal
utilities, propane tanks, or fuel oil. With the exception of telephone,
the rules are consistent across utilities. These rules and regulations
cover the initiation of service, payment arrangements, termination
of service, the terms of restoration of service, the requirement of
deposits, municipal guarantees and guarantees from other third
parties. There are special rules as to winter termination. The
welfare official should be familiar with these rules in order to
ensure that needs are properly met at the lowest available cost. The
PUC has a toll-free consumer assistance number: 800-852-3793.
(a) Arrearages. Arrearages will not be included except when
necessary to ensure the health and safety of the applicant
household or to prevent termination of utility service where no
other resources or referrals can be utilized. In accordance with
the rules of the PUC relating to electric utilities, arrearages for
electric service need not be paid if the welfare official notifies
the electric company that the municipality guarantees
payment of current electric bills as long as the recipient
remains eligible for general assistance.
(b) Restoration of service.
[1] When utility service has been terminated and the welfare
official has determined that alternative utility service is
not available and alternative shelter is not feasible,
arrearages will be included in "need" when restoration of
service is necessary to ensure the health and safety of the
applicant household. The welfare official may negotiate
with the utility for payment of less than the full amount of
the arrears and/or may attempt to arrange a repayment
plan to obtain restoration of service.
[2] When electric service has been terminated and restoration
is required, arrearages may either be included as set forth
in the above subsection or may be paid in accordance with
§ 482-8 SALEM CODE § 482-8
1:474
a reasonable payment plan entered into by the applicant
and the electric company. The welfare official may hold
the recipient accountable for the payment arrangement
for as long as the recipient continues to request general
assistance on a regular basis. Payment of a payment plan
may be a required element of a notice of decision or case
plan.
(c) Deposits. Utility security deposits will be considered as "need"
if, and only if, the applicant is unable to secure funds for the
payment of the deposit and is unable to secure utility service
without a deposit. Such deposits shall, however, be the
property of the municipality.
(3) Food. The amount included as "need" for food purchases will be in
accordance with the most recent standard food stamp allotment, as
determined under the food stamp program administered by the
New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services. An
amount in excess of the standard food allotment may be granted if
one or more members of the household need a special diet, as
verified by the welfare official, the documented cost of which is
greater than can be purchased with the family's allotment of food
stamps. Food vouchers may not be used for alcohol, tobacco, pet
food, or reading materials.
(4) Household maintenance allowance. Applicants may include, in
calculating "need," the cost of providing personal and household
necessities in an amount not to exceed these guidelines, as
determined in accordance with Subsection E(11) below. (See
Appendix A.161) Need allowance for diapers shall be calculated
based on usage.
(5) Telephone. If the absence of a telephone would create an
unreasonable risk to the applicant's health or safety (as verified by
the welfare official), or for other good cause as determined by the
welfare official, the lowest available basic monthly rate will be
budgeted as "need." While payments will not be made for telephone
bills, under exceptional circumstances where no other source of
assistance is available payments may be made to maintain basic
telephone service.
(6) Transportation. If the welfare official determines that
transportation is necessary (e.g., for health or medical reasons, to
maintain employment, or to comply with conditions of assistance),
"need" should include the costs of public transportation, where
available. If, and only if, the transportation need cannot be
reasonably provided by alternative means, such as public
transportation or volunteer drivers, a reasonable amount for car
161. Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file at the office of the welfare official.
§ 482-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-8
1:475
payments and gasoline should be included as part of "need" when
determining eligibility or amount of aid.
(7) Maintenance of insurance. In the event that the welfare official
determines that the maintenance of medical insurance is essential,
an applicant may include as "need" the reasonable cost of such
premiums.
(8) Emergency and other expenses. In the event that the applicant has
the following current expenses, the actual cost shall be included as
emergency and other expenses to determine eligibility and amount
of assistance:
(a) Medical expenses. The welfare official shall not consider
including amounts for medical, dental or eye services unless
the applicant can verify that all other potential sources have
been investigated and that there is no source of assistance
other than local welfare. Other sources to be considered shall
include state and federal programs, local and area clinics, area
service organizations and area hospital indigent programs
designed for such needs. When an applicant requests medical
service, prescriptions, dental service or eye service, the local
welfare official may require verification from a doctor, dentist
or person licensed to practice optometry in the area, indicating
that these services are absolutely necessary and cannot be
postponed without creating a significant risk that the
applicant's well-being will be placed in serious jeopardy.
(b) Legal expenses. Except for those specifically required by
statute, no legal expenses will be included.
(c) Clothing. If the applicant has an emergency clothing need
which cannot be met in a timely fashion by other community
resources (i.e., Salvation Army, Red Cross, church group), the
expense of reasonably meeting that emergency clothing need
will be included.
(9) Unusual needs not otherwise provided for in these guidelines. If the
welfare official determines that the strict application of the
standard of need criteria will result in unnecessary or undue
hardship (e.g., needed services are inaccessible to the applicant),
such official may make minor adjustments in the criteria or may
make allowances using the emergency need standards stated in
§ 482-5D(2) of these guidelines. Any such determination, and the
reasons therefor, shall be stated in writing in the applicant's case
record.
(10) Shared expenses. If the applicant/recipient household shares
shelter, utility, or other expenses with a nonapplicant/recipient (i.e.,
is part of a residential unit), then need should be determined on a
pro rata share, based on the total number of adults in the
residential unit (e.g., three adults in residential unit, but only one
§ 482-8 SALEM CODE § 482-8
1:476
applies for assistance: shelter need is 1/3 of shelter allowance for
household of three adults).
(11) Payment levels for allowable expenses. When adopting these
guidelines, the municipal governing body shall establish payment
levels for various allowable expenses such as food and maintenance
cost which shall be based on actual local market conditions and
costs. The payment levels shall be reviewed by the welfare official
annually, and market rents established by the New Hampshire
Housing Finance Authority through HUD will be used as guides.
F. Income. In determining eligibility and the amount of assistance, the
standard of need shall be compared to the available income/assets.
Computation of income and expenses will be by the month. The
following items will be included in the computation:
(1) Earned income. Income in cash or in kind earned by the applicant
or any member of the household through wages, salary,
commissions, or profit, whether self-employed or as an employee, is
to be included as income. Rental income and profits from items sold
are considered earned income. With respect to self-employment,
total profit is arrived at by subtracting business expenses from
gross income in accordance with standard accounting principles.
When income consists of wages, the amount computed should be
that available after income taxes, social security and other payroll
deductions required by state, federal, or local law, court-ordered
support payments and child care costs, and work-related clothing
costs have been deducted from income. Wages that are trusted, or
income similarly unavailable to the applicant or applicant's
dependents, should not be included.
(2) Income or support from other persons. Contributions from relatives
or other household members shall be considered as income only if
actually available and received by the applicant or recipient. The
income of nonhousehold members of the applicant's residential
unit shall not be counted as income. Expenses shared with
nonhousehold members may affect the level of need, however. See
Subsection E(10) regarding determination of need in cases of
nonhousehold residential units.]
(3) Income from other assistance or social insurance programs.
(a) State categorical assistance benefits, OASDI payments, social
security payments, VA benefits, unemployment insurance
benefits, and payment from other government sources shall be
considered income.
(b) Food stamps cannot be counted as income pursuant to federal
law [7 U.S.C. § 2017(b)] but may be considered under
"standard of need" to determine true food expenses.
§ 482-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-8
1:477
(c) Fuel assistance cannot be counted as income pursuant to
federal law [42 U.S.C. § 8624(f)(1)] but may be considered
under "standard of need" to determine true fuel expenses.
(4) Court-ordered support payments. Alimony and child support
payments shall be considered income only if actually received by
the applicant or recipient.
(5) Income from other sources. Payment from pension, trust funds, and
similar programs shall be considered income.
(6) Earnings of a child. No inquiry shall be made into the earnings of a
child 14 years of age or less unless that child makes a regular and
substantial contribution to the family.
(7) Option to treat a qualified state assistance reduction as deemed
income. The welfare official may deem as income all or any portion
of any qualified state assistance reduction pursuant to RSA 167:82,
VIII. The following criteria shall apply to any action to deem income
under this section: (RSA 165:1-e)
(a) The authority to deem income under this section shall
terminate when the qualified state assistance reduction no
longer is in effect.
(b) Applicants for general assistance may be required to cooperate
in obtaining information from the Department of Health and
Human Services as to the existence and amount of any
qualified state assistance reduction. No applicant for general
assistance may be considered to be subject to a qualified state
assistance reduction unless the existence and amount have
been confirmed by the Department of Health and Human
Services.
(c) The welfare official shall provide the applicant with a written
decision which sets forth the amount of any deemed income
used to determine eligibility for general assistance.
(d) Whenever necessary to prevent an immediate threat to the
health and safety of children in the household, the welfare
official shall waive that portion, if any, of the qualified state
assistance reduction as necessary.
G. Residents of shelters for victims of domestic violence and their
children. An applicant residing in a shelter for victims of domestic
violence and their children who has income, and owns resources jointly
with the abusive member of the applicant's household, shall be required
to cooperate with the normal procedures for purposes of verification.
Such resources and income may be excluded from eligibility
determinations unless the applicant has safe access to joint resources
at the time of application. The verification process may be completed
through an authorized representative of the shelter of residence. The
§ 482-8 SALEM CODE § 482-8
1:478
§ 482-9. Nonresidents.
normal procedures taken in accordance with these guidelines to
recover assistance granted shall not delay such assistance.
A. Eligibility. Applicants who are temporarily in a municipality which is not
their municipality of residence and who do not intend to make a
residence there are nonetheless eligible to receive general assistance,
provided that they are poor and unable to support themselves. RSA
165:1-c. No applicant shall be refused assistance solely on the basis of
residence. RSA 165:1. The welfare administrator using his/her
discretion may provide limited assistance.
B. Standards. The application procedure, eligibility standards and
standard of need shall be the same for nonresidents as for residents.
C. Verification. Verification records shall not be considered unavailable,
nor the applicant's responsibility for providing such records relaxed,
solely because they are located in the applicant's municipality of
residence.
D. Temporary or emergency aid. The standards for the fulfilling of
immediate or emergency needs of nonresidents and for temporary
assistance pending final decision shall be the same as for residents, as
set forth in § 482-5D(2).
E. Determination of residence. Determination of residence shall be made
if the applicant requests return home transportation (see Subsection F
below) or if the welfare official has reason to believe the applicant is a
resident of another New Hampshire municipality from which recovery
can be made under RSA 165:20.
(1) Minors. The residence of a minor applicant shall be presumed to be
the residence of his/her custodial parent or guardian.
(2) Adults. For competent adults, the standard for determining
residence shall be the overall intent of the applicant, as set forth in
the definition of "residence" in § 482-1. The statement of an
applicant over 18 as to his/her residence or intent to establish
residence shall be accepted in the absence of strongly inconsistent
evidence or behavior.
F. Return home transportation. At the request of a nonresident applicant,
any aid, temporary or otherwise, to which he/she would be otherwise
entitled under the standards set forth in these guidelines may be used
by the welfare official to cause the applicant to be returned to his/her
municipality of residence. RSA 165:1-c.
G. Recovery. Any aid given to a nonresident, including the costs of return
home transportation, may be recovered from his/her municipality of
residence using the procedures of § 482-15B.
§ 482-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-10
1:479
§ 482-10. Municipal work programs.
A. Participation. Any recipient of general assistance who is able and not
gainfully employed may be required to work for the municipality or an
appropriate local human service agency at any available bona fide job
that is within his/her capacity (RSA 165:31) for the purpose of
reimbursement of benefits received. Participants in the work program
are not considered employees of the municipality, and any work
performed by workfare participants does not give rise to any employeeemployer
relationship between the recipient/workfare participant and
the municipality.
B. Reimbursement rate. The workfare participant shall be allotted the
prevailing municipal wage for work performed, but in no case less than
the minimum wage. No cash compensation shall be paid for workfare
participation; the wage value of all hours worked shall be used to
reimburse the municipality for assistance given. No workfare
participant shall be required to work more hours than necessary to
reimburse aid rendered.
C. Continuing financial liability. If, due to lack of available municipal work
or other good cause, a recipient does not work a sufficient number of
hours to fully reimburse the municipality for the amount of his/her aid,
the amount of aid received less the value of work program hours
completed shall still be owed to the municipality.
D. Allowance for work search. The municipality shall provide reasonable
time during working hours for the workfare participant to conduct a
documented employment search.
E. Workfare program attendance.
(1) With prior notice to the welfare official, a recipient may be excused
from workfare participation if he/she:
(a) Has a conflicting job interview;
(b) Has a conflicting interview at a service or welfare agency;
(c) Has a medical appointment or illness;
(d) As a parent or person "in loco parentis" must care for a child
under the age of five. A recipient responsible for a child age
five but under 12 shall not be required to work during hours
the child is not in school, if there is no responsible person
available to provide care, and no other care is available;
(e) Is unable to work due to mental or physical disability, as
verified by the welfare official;
(f) Must remain at home because of illness or disability of another
member of the household, as verified by the welfare official; or
§ 482-10 SALEM CODE § 482-10
1:480
§ 482-11. Burials and cremations.
The welfare official shall provide for proper burial or cremation, at
municipal expense, of persons found in the municipality at time of death,
regardless of whether the deceased person ever applied for or received
general assistance from any municipality. In such cases, assistance may
be applied for on behalf of the deceased person; however the application
should be made before any burial or cremation expenses are incurred.
The expense may be recovered from the deceased person's municipality of
residence or from a liable relative pursuant to RSA 165:3, II. If relatives,
other private persons, the state or other sources are unable to cover the
entire burial/cremation expense, the municipality will pay up to $1,000 for
burial/cremation. (See Appendix A.162) RSA 165:3 and RSA 165:1-b; see also
RSA 165:27 and RSA 165:27-a.
§ 482-12. Right to notice of adverse action.
(g) Does not possess the materials or tools required to perform the
task and the municipality fails to provide them.
(2) However, the workfare participant should attempt to schedule
appointments so as not to conflict with the workfare program and
must notify his/her supervisor in advance of the appointment. The
welfare official may require participants to provide documentation
of their attendance at a conflicting interview or appointment.
F. Workfare hours. Workfare hours are subject to approval of the
supervisor and the welfare official. Failure of the participant to adhere
to the agreed workfare hours (except for the reasons listed above) will
prompt review of the recipient's eligibility for general assistance and
may result in a suspension or termination of assistance. See
§ 482-12C(2)(b).
G. Workers' compensation. The municipality shall provide workers'
compensation coverage to participants in workfare programs in the
same manner such coverage is provided to other municipal employees,
unless the local governing body of the municipality has voted to adopt a
guideline making the provisions of the workers' compensation laws not
applicable to workfare program participants. RSA 281-A:2, VII(b).
A. Right to a written decision. All persons have a constitutional right to be
free of unfair, arbitrary or unreasonable action taken by government.
This includes applicants for and recipients of general assistance whose
aid has been denied, terminated or reduced. Every applicant and
recipient shall be given a written notice of every decision regarding
assistance. (See § 482-5D for notice where application is granted.) The
welfare official will make every effort to ensure that the applicant
understands the decision.
162. Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file at the office of the welfare official.
§ 482-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-12
1:481
B. Action taken for reasons other than noncompliance with the guidelines.
(1) Whenever a decision is made to deny assistance or to refuse to
grant the full amount of assistance requested, a notice of the
decision shall be given or mailed to the applicant either the same
day or next work day following the making of the decision or within
five working days from the time the application is filled out and
submitted, whichever occurs first.
(2) The notice required by Subsection B(1) above shall contain:
(a) A clear statement of the reasons for the denial or not providing
full assistance requested.
(b) A statement advising the recipient of his/her right to a fair
hearing and that any request for a fair hearing must be made in
writing within five working days.
(c) A form on which the recipient may request a fair hearing.
(d) A statement advising the recipient of the time limits which
must be met in order to receive a fair hearing.
(e) A statement that assistance may continue, if there was initial
eligibility, until the date of hearing, if requested by the
claimant. Aid must be repaid if the claimant fails to prevail at
the hearing.
C. Suspension for noncompliance with the guidelines.
NOTE: This procedure has been developed by the Local Government
Center (LGC) in an effort to set forth a clear process for suspension
of assistance for willful noncompliance with guidelines, under RSA
165:1-b. There are differing opinions as to the intent and interpretation
of the statute. There are differing opinions as to the specific procedures
required by the statute. The procedures outlined in this section are not
specifically mandated by RSA 165:1-b but are LGC's attempts to create
a legally sound compromise. See also Appendix B.163
(1) Due process. Recipients must comply with these guidelines and the
reasonable requests of welfare officials. Welfare officials must
enforce the guidelines while ensuring that all recipients and
applicants receive due process. Recipients should be given
reasonable notice of the conditions and requirements of eligibility
and future eligibility and notice that noncompliance may result in
termination or suspension.
(2) Conditions. Any applicant/recipient otherwise eligible for
assistance shall become ineligible under RSA 165:1-b if he/she
willfully and without good cause fails to comply with the
requirements of these guidelines relating to the obligation to:
163. Editor's Note: Appendix B is on file at the office of the welfare official.
§ 482-12 SALEM CODE § 482-12
1:482
(a) Disclose and provide verification of income, resources or other
material financial data, as set out in §§ 482-5C and 482-6 of
these guidelines, including any changes in this information;
(b) Participate in the work program under § 482-5C, to the extent
assigned by the welfare official;
(c) Comply with the work search requirements imposed by the
welfare official under § 482-5C; and
(d) Apply for other public assistance, as required by the welfare
official under § 482-5C.
(3) First notice. No recipient otherwise eligible shall be suspended for
noncompliance with conditions unless he/she has been given a
written notice of the actions required in order to remain eligible
and a seven-day period within which to comply. The first notice
should be given at the time of the notice of decision and thereafter
as conditions change. (See Form L.164) Additional notice of actions
required should also be given, as eligibility is redetermined, but
without an additional seven-day period unless new actions are
required. RSA 165:1-b, II.
(4) Noncompliance.
(a) If a recipient willfully and without good cause fails to come into
compliance during the seven-day period, or willfully falls into
noncompliance within 30 days from receipt of a first notice, the
welfare official shall give the recipient a suspension notice, as
set forth in Subsection C(5). See Form L; see Appendix B.165
(b) If a recipient falls into noncompliance for the first time more
than 30 days after receipt of a first notice, the welfare official
shall give the recipient a new first notice with a new seven-day
period to comply (see Form L) before giving the recipient the
suspension notice. RSA 165:1-b, III.
(5) Suspension notice. Written notice to a recipient that he/she is
suspended from assistance due to failure to comply with the
conditions required in a first notice shall include (see Form L):
(a) A list of the guidelines with which the recipient is not in
compliance and a description of those actions necessary for
compliance;
(b) The period of suspension [see Subsection C(6) below];
(c) Notice of the right to a fair hearing on the issue of willful
noncompliance and that such request must be made in writing
within five days of receipt of the suspension notice;

§ 482-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-12
1:483
§ 482-13. Fair hearings.
(d) A statement that assistance may continue in accordance with
the prior eligibility determination until the fair hearing
decision is made if the recipient so requests on the request
form for the fair hearing; however, if the recipient fails to
prevail at the hearing, the suspension will start after the
decision and such aid must be repaid by the recipient; and
(e) A form on which the individual may request a fair hearing and
the continuance of assistance pending the outcome.
(6) Suspension period.
(a) The suspension period for failure to comply with these
guidelines shall last:
[1] Either seven days or 14 days if the recipient has had a
prior suspension which ended within the past six months;
and
[2] Until the recipient complies with the guidelines if the
recipient, upon the expiration of the seven- or fourteen-day
suspension period, continues to fail to carry out the
specific actions set forth in the notice.
(b) Notwithstanding Subsection C(6)(a)[2] above, a recipient who
has been suspended for noncompliance for at least six months
may file a new application for assistance without coming back
into compliance
(7) Fair hearing on continuing noncompliance. A recipient who has
been suspended until he/she complies with the guidelines may
request a fair hearing to resolve a dispute over whether or not he/
she has satisfactorily complied with the required guidelines;
however no assistance shall be available under Subsection C(5)(d)
above.
(8) Compliance after suspension. A recipient who has been subject to a
suspension and who has come back into compliance shall have his/
her assistance resumed, provided that he/she is still otherwise
eligible. The notice of decision stating that assistance has been
resumed should again set forth the actions required to remain
eligible for assistance but need not provide a seven-day period for
compliance unless new conditions have been imposed.
A. Requests. A request for a fair hearing is a written expression, by the
applicant or recipient, or any person acting for him/her, to the effect
that he/she wants an opportunity to present his/her case to a higher
authority. When a request for assistance is denied or when an applicant
desires to challenge a decision made by the welfare official relative to
the receipt of assistance, the applicant must present a request for a fair
§ 482-12 SALEM CODE § 482-13
1:484
hearing to the welfare official within five working days of receipt of the
notice of decision at issue. RSA 165:1-b, III. See Form O.166
B. Time limits for hearings. Hearings requested by claimants must be held
within seven working days of the receipt of the request. The welfare
official shall give notice to the claimant setting the time and location of
the hearing. This notice must be given to the claimant at least 48 hours
in advance of the hearing or mailed to the claimant at least 72 hours in
advance of the hearing.
C. The fair hearing officer(s). The fair hearing officer(s) may be chosen by
the Board of Selectmen. The person(s) serving as the fair hearing
authority must:
(1) Not have participated in the decision causing dissatisfaction;
(2) Be impartial;
(3) Be sufficiently skilled in interviewing to be able to obtain evidence
and facts necessary for a fair determination; and
(4) Be capable of evaluating all evidence fairly and realistically, to
explain to the claimant the laws and regulations under which the
welfare official operated, and to interpret to the welfare official any
evidence of unsound, unclear or inequitable policies, practices or
action.
D. Fair hearing procedures.
(1) All fair hearings shall be conducted in such a manner as to ensure
due process of law. Fair hearings shall not be conducted according
to strict rules of evidence. The burden of proof shall be on the
claimant, who shall be required to establish his/her case by a
preponderance of the evidence.
(2) The welfare official responsible for the disputed decision shall
attend the hearing and testify about his/her actions and the reasons
therefor.
(3) Both parties shall be given the opportunity to offer evidence and
explain their positions as fully and completely as they wish. The
claimant shall have the opportunity to present his/her own case or,
at the claimant's option, with the aid of others and to bring
witnesses, to establish all pertinent facts, to advance any
arguments without undue interference, and to question or refute
testimony or evidence, including the opportunity to confront and
cross-examine adverse witnesses.
(4) A claimant or his/her duly authorized representative has the right
to examine, prior to a fair hearing, all records, papers and
documents from the claimant's case file which either party may
166. Editor's Note: Form O is on file at the office of the welfare official.
§ 482-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 482-13
1:485
wish to introduce at the fair hearing, as well as any available
documents not contained in the case file but relevant to the welfare
official's action of which the claimant complains. The claimant may
introduce any such documents, papers or records into evidence.
No record, paper or document which the claimant has requested
to review but has not been allowed to examine prior to the hearing
shall be introduced at the hearing or become part of the record.
(5) The welfare official (or a duly authorized representative) shall have
the right to examine at the fair hearing all documents on which the
claimant plans to rely at the fair hearing and may request a twentyfour-
hour continuance if such documents contain evidence not
previously provided or disclosed by the claimant. Should the
applicant have new documentation relevant to the disputed
decision, he/she may reapply for assistance and file a written
withdrawal of the fair hearing request.
(6) The decision of the fair hearing officer(s) must be based solely on
the record, in light of these guidelines. Evidence, both written and
oral, which is admitted at the hearing shall be the sole contents of
the record. The fair hearing officer shall not review the case record
or other materials prior to introduction at the hearing.
(7) The parties may stipulate to any facts.
(8) All fair hearings may be tape-recorded and retained for six months.
E. Decisions.
(1) Fair hearing decisions shall be rendered within seven working days
of the hearing. Decisions shall be in writing setting forth the
reasons for decision and the facts on which the fair hearing officer
relied in reaching the decision. A copy of the decision shall be
mailed or delivered to the claimant and to the welfare official.
(2) Fair hearing decisions will be rendered on the basis of the officer's
findings of fact, these guidelines and state and federal law. The fair
hearing decision shall set forth appropriate relief.
(3) The decision shall be dated. In the case of a hearing to review a
denial of aid, the decision is retroactive to the date of the action
being appealed. If a claimant fails to prevail at the hearing, the
assistance given pending the hearing shall be a debt owed by the
individual to the municipality.
(4) The welfare official shall keep all fair hearing decisions on file in
chronological order.
(5) None of the procedures specified herein shall limit any right of the
applicant or recipient to subsequent court action to review or
challenge the adverse decision.

1:486
§ 482-14. Liens.
§ 482-15. Recovery of assistance.
The welfare official shall seek to recover money expended to assist eligible
applicants. There shall be no delay, refusal to assist, reduction or
termination of assistance while the welfare official is pursuing the
procedural or statutory avenues to secure reimbursement. Any legal action
A. Real estate. The law requires the municipality to place a lien for welfare
aid received on any real estate owned by an assisted person in all cases
except for just cause. (This section does not authorize the placement of
a lien on the real estate of legally liable relatives, as defined by RSA
165:19.) The Selectmen shall file a notice of lien with the County
Registry of Deeds, complete with the owner's name and a description of
the property sufficient to identify it. Interest at the rate of 6% per year,
simple interest, shall be charged on the amount of the lien commencing
one year after the date the lien is filed, unless waived by the
municipality. Simple interest, not compounded interest, will be used.
The lien remains in effect until enforced or released or until the amount
of the lien is repaid to the municipality. The lien shall not be enforced so
long as the real estate is occupied as the sole residence of the assisted
person, his/her surviving spouse, or his/her surviving children who are
under age 18 or blind or permanently and totally disabled. At such time
as the lien may become enforceable, the welfare officer shall attempt to
contact the attorney handling the real estate or estate before enforcing
the lien. Upon repayment of a lien, the municipality must file written
notice of the discharge of the lien with the County Registry of Deeds
(RSA 165:28). A sample notice of lien is included in Appendix E as Form
R.167
B. Civil judgments. RSA 165:28-a.
(1) A municipality shall be entitled to a lien upon property passing
under the terms of a will or by intestate succession, a property
settlement, or a civil judgment for personal injuries (except
workers' compensation) awarded any person granted assistance by
the municipality for the amount of assistance granted by the
municipality.
(2) The municipality shall be entitled to the lien only if the assistance
was granted no more than six years before the receipt of the
inheritance or the award of the property settlement or civil
judgment. When the welfare officer becomes aware of such a claim
against a civil judgment, he/she shall contact the attorney
representing the recipient.
(3) This lien shall take precedence over all other claims.

to recover must be filed in a court within six years after the expenditure.
RSA 165:25.
§ 482-16. Application of rents paid by municipality.
Whenever the owner of property rented to a person receiving general
assistance from the municipality is in arrears in sewer, water, electricity, or
tax payments to the municipality, the municipality may apply the assistance
which the property owner would have received in payment of rent on
behalf of such assisted person to the property owner's delinquent balances,
regardless of whether such delinquent balances are in respect of property
occupied by the assisted person. RSA 165:4-a.
A. Recovery. The welfare official may seek recovery from legally
responsible relatives and shall seek to recover from the municipality of
residence the amount of money spent by the municipality to assist a
recipient who has a residence in another municipality. Written notice of
money spent in support of a recipient must be given to the welfare
official of the municipality of residence. In any civil action for recovery
brought under RSA 165:20, the court shall award costs to the prevailing
party. RSA 165:19 and RSA 165:20. (See RSA 165:20-a providing for
arbitration of such disputes between communities.)
B. Recovery from former recipient's income. A former recipient who is
returned to an income status after receiving assistance may be required
to reimburse the municipality for the assistance provided, if such
reimbursement can be made without financial hardship. RSA 165:20-b.
C. Recovery from state and federal sources. The amount of money spent by
a municipality to support a recipient who has made initial application
for SSI and has signed HHS Form 151 "Authorization for
Reimbursement of Interim Assistance" shall be recovered through the
SSA and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human
Services. Prescription expenses paid by the municipality for applicants
who have applied for Medicaid shall be recovered through the New
Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services if and when the
applicant is approved for medical coverage.
D. Delayed state claims. For those recipients of general assistance deemed
eligible for state assistance, the New Hampshire Department of Health
and Human Services shall reimburse a municipality the amount of
general assistance as a result of delays in processing within the
federally mandated time periods. Any claims for reimbursement shall
be held until the end of the fiscal year and may be reimbursed on a
prorated basis dependent upon the total claims filed per year. RSA
165:20-c. A Form 340 "Request for State Reimbursement" may be
obtained from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human
Services for this purpose.
A. Payment arrears. A payment shall be considered in arrears if more than

A. Applicability of section. The following regulations shall govern the
erection and alteration of buildings or structures and the use of land in
the Residential District, except that they shall not apply to existing
buildings or structures nor to the existing use of any building or
structure but shall apply to any alteration of a building or structure for
use for a purpose or in a manner substantially different from the use to
which it was put before alteration. However, no building or structure
qualifying as a nonconforming use shall be occupied for a greater
portion of the year than such building or structure was occupied as a
prior nonconforming use unless minimum lot size, setbacks, frontage,
building line, and all other dimensional requirements for this district

case, the requirements for septic systems, as stated in Chapter 391,
Article I, of the Salem Code, shall be met. Additionally, no building
permits or variances shall be granted that would be likely to result in an
increase of the portion of the year during which a building or structure
qualifying as a nonconforming use will be occupied if such increased
occupation will affect adversely public health standards, water quality,
sewage treatment requirements or the water quality of any lake, stream
or surface water system. The restrictions of § 490-202, minimum lot
size, minimum frontage, and minimum width at the building line, shall
not apply to lots shown in a plat approved by the Salem Planning Board
prior to the adoption of this chapter until January 1, 1981, except that if
two or more lots are contiguous and are held in identical ownership and
none of the lots are improved by a house, then the restrictions of
§ 490-202, minimum lot size, shall apply forthwith. Discontinuance of a
nonconforming use for whatever reason for 12 consecutive months
shall subject such property to all of the requirements of this section.
[Amended by the 1986 Town Meeting]
B. Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted in the Residential
District:
(1) One-family and two-family dwellings.

1:509
person be granted permission to conduct such sales on more than
three calendar days in any calendar year.
(5) Family day-care homes, as defined in RSA 170-E:2, if licensed by

private schools and hospitals, if the Board of Adjustment shall find
that all restrictions of this section are met, or an exception or
variance therefor granted, and that such land is reasonably
adapted to the use, and either that the use will so alleviate the
burden of similar facilities in the Town or that such use will be
advantageous to the health, morals, and general welfare of such
numbers of persons in such degree as will outweigh any diminution
of property values created thereby.
(2) Relief from any of the provisions of this section shall be granted for
a specified temporary period of time if the Board of Adjustment
shall find either:
(a) That a public emergency exists or is threatened of so serious a
character as to outweigh any diminution of surrounding

relief; or
§ 490-301 SALEM CODE § 490-301
1:510
§ 490-302. Rural District.
(b) That such relief from any such provisions for one year would be
reasonably necessary for the ultimate use or development of
land in a permitted and desirable way, other than as a onefamily
dwelling, and that such relief would be outweighed by
the advantages available from such ultimate use of the land.
E. Variances. In granting variances, the following shall be generally
considered contrary to the spirit of this chapter in the Residential
District:

purpose or in a manner substantially different from the use to which it
was put before alteration. However, no building or structure qualifying
as a nonconforming use shall be occupied for a greater portion of the
year than such building or structure was occupied as a prior
nonconforming use unless minimum lot size, setbacks, frontage,
building line, and all other dimensional requirements for this district
are met or a variance is granted by the Board of Adjustment. In either
case, the requirements for septic systems, as stated in Chapter 391,
Article I, of the Salem Code, shall be met. Additionally, no building
permits or variances shall be granted that would be likely to result in an
increase of the portion of the year during which a building or structure
qualifying as a nonconforming use will be occupied if such increased
occupation will affect adversely public health standards, water quality,
sewage treatment requirements or the water quality of any lake, stream
or surface water system. The restrictions of § 490-202, minimum lot
size, minimum frontage, and setbacks, and § 490-804, Proximity to
water bodies, shall not apply to lots shown in a plat approved by the
Salem Planning Board prior to the adoption of this chapter until January
1, 1981, except that if two or more lots are contiguous and are held in
identical ownership and none of the lots are improved by a house, then
the restrictions of § 490-202, minimum lot size, shall apply forthwith.
Discontinuance of a nonconforming use for whatever reason for 12
consecutive months shall subject such property to all of the
requirements of this section.

a specified temporary period of time if the Board of Adjustment
shall find either:

property values, any fire, health or aesthetic dangers or any
overcrowding of land or of public facilities occasioned by such
relief; or
(b) That such relief from any such provisions for such temporary
period not exceeding one year would be reasonably necessary

be outweighed by the advantages available from such ultimate
use of the land.

ranges, equipment sheds and other buildings necessary for the
normal operation of golf courses if and to the extent that the Board
of Adjustment shall find that such relief will not create a fire,
sanitation, odor, health or traffic hazard, and that such relief would
tend to promote more advantageous use of land in the immediate
area, and that such relief would not seriously diminish the value of
surrounding property, and that such relief would not be contrary to
the spirit of this chapter. [Added by the 1990 Town Meeting]
E. Variances. In granting or denying variances in the Rural Districts, the

as a nonconforming use shall be occupied for a greater portion of the
year than such building or structure was occupied as a prior
nonconforming use unless minimum lot size, setbacks, frontage,
building line, and all other dimensional requirements for this district
are met or a variance is granted by the Board of Adjustment. In either
case, the requirements for septic systems, as stated in Chapter 391,
Article I, of the Salem Code, shall be met. Additionally, no building
permits or variances shall be granted that would be likely to result in an
increase of the portion of the year during which a building or structure
qualifying as a nonconforming use will be occupied if such increased
occupation will affect adversely public health standards, water quality,
sewage treatment requirements or the water quality of any lake, stream
or surface water system. The restrictions of § 490-202, minimum lot

temporary period of time not to exceed one year, if the Board of
Adjustment shall find either:
(a) That a public emergency exists or is threatened of so serious a

property values or any fire, health or traffic dangers or any
overcrowding of land or of public facilities occasioned by such
relief; or
(b) That such relief from any of the provisions of this section for
such temporary period would be reasonable, necessary, or
desirable for the ultimate use or development of land in a

and additions to existing buildings should have generous setbacks as
seen from the major streets and provide natural, open space buffers
between uses in order to maintain the character of the district.
(1) Zoning dimensions: see § 490-202.
(a) Open space shall consist of no less than 50% of the lot area.
(2) Design and architectural standards.
(a) Massing and style. Building massing and style must draw on
the historical design elements that are contextually consistent
with regional New England architecture. Historical and
traditional design elements are encouraged. Neoclassical
design vocabularies are preferred within the district. Fences
and landscaping to screen service areas must be provided,
consistent with the intent and use of the space.
(b) Roofs. Preference shall be given to pitched roofs, consistent
with New England traditional or vernacular styles. Material
must be consistent with the architecture of the building.
Composition shingle material is acceptable, provided that it is
of high quality and provides architectural definition to the tab
shingle to emulate traditional wood shingle styles. Tile, slate,
or metal roofing is permitted, provided that it is consistent with
the architectural style of the building.
(c) Facade element. Design of the facade shall be highly detailed
and articulated to be compatible with the scale and sensitivity
to the institutional uses within the district. Facades should
§ 490-403 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-403
1:527
have a well-defined foundation, a modulated wall element, and
pitched roof or articulated cornice which defines the character
of the building.
(d) Entrances. Building entrances must comply with all current
accessibility regulations; however, the use of ramps and lifts is
discouraged. Buildings should be designed with entrances that
are barrier free for the intended uses. Where grade separation
of an entrance is required because of site topography,
accommodation should be provided in the architectural detail
of the entry to allow barrier-free use by building occupants and
visitors.
(e) Door and window openings. Doors and windows should be
entirely consistent with the architecture of the buildings in
design and placement. The use of cornices, architectural
moldings, side lights, transom lights, and raised panels in
doors is encouraged. A wide range of material for doors and
windows is acceptable, except that the use of commercial,
anodized or painted aluminum or steel storefront assemblies is
discouraged.
(f) Materials and design elements. Material chosen for exterior
elements should be consistent with the intent and use of
materials traditionally found in commercial and residential
design in New England. Siding materials such as clapboard
and shingle are preferred, and the use of new materials which
reduce maintenance but emulate the look and feel of
traditional materials is encouraged. The use of a variety of trim
material to provide detail at the eaves, corners, gables,
pediments, lintels, sills, quoins, and balustrades is encouraged.
The use of bays, towers, cupolas, cross gables, and dormers to
provide unique character to a building and provide articulation
of the facade is encouraged.
(g) Paving and curbing. Granite curbing, gray in color, is required
on all public roads. Rolled asphalt (Cape Cod berm) curbing is
unacceptable on all public roads but is permissible on private
roads, driveways, and parking lots. Curbing is to be sloped or
cut to provide a barrier-free transition at road crossings and
building entrances. Paving should be textured or of different
materials at pedestrian crossings and walkways. The use of
stone, brick or cultured stone pavers for entrance walkways is
encouraged. The use of textured materials for walkway
borders is encouraged.
(h) Signs. Signs of all types and description must conform to all
criteria and requirements established in § 490-702D.
(3) Parking. In addition to the requirements as set forth in § 490-701,
public parking for more than 10 cars must be allocated to the side
§ 490-403 SALEM CODE § 490-403
1:528
and rear of all buildings in such a way as to be buffered from public
view from the access street. The intent of this section is to maintain
a high standard of land planning and landscape architecture within
the district consistent with Salem's rural heritage. The criteria
established in the Site Plan Review Regulations are to be applied
in this district. In addition, the following special landscaping
requirements apply:

along the parking area perimeter fronting the access street
consisting of ground cover, shrubs, and shade or ornamental
trees.

caliper or greater, and evergreen trees must be a minimum of
six feet in height.

provide canopy shade trees of three-inch caliper or greater for
every six parking stalls or fraction thereof selected from the
species as set forth in the Site Plan Review Regulations.
Alternately, one shade tree of four-inch caliper or greater may
be planted for every 12 parking stalls or fraction thereof. Each
tree shall be located in a planting area and/or tree well no less
than nine square feet in area.
(f) If wheel stops or curbing is provided, continuous planting
areas with low ground cover and tree wells with trees centered
at the corner of parking stalls may be located within the threefoot
overhang space of parking stalls.

this section but shall comply with the provisions of the Residential
District. [Added by the 1999 Town Meeting]

overcrowding of land or of public facilities occasioned by such
relief; or
(b) That such relief from any such provisions for such temporary
period, not to exceed one year, would be reasonably necessary
or desirable for the ultimate use or development of land in a
permitted or desirable way, and that any disadvantage of such
relief would be outweighed by the advantages available from

ARTICLE VI
Overlay Districts
§ 490-601. Seniors Housing Overlay District. [Added by the 1998
Town Meeting]
A. Intent and purpose.
(1) It is the intent of this section to recognize the need for granting
provisions in certain districts of the Town of Salem whereby
appropriate housing alternatives may be provided for active adults
age 55 and over, elderly persons living independently, frail elderly
persons, and elderly persons requiring skilled or specialty nursing
facilities, and provide appropriate supportive health care and
services for older persons.
(2) This section is intended to operate as a Seniors Housing Overlay
District and will prevail in lieu of the underlying zoning, in
appropriate circumstances, as determined by the Town of Salem
Planning Board, to provide housing opportunities for elderly
persons and provide opportunity for transitional uses between
commercial districts, business districts, the Town Center District,
and abutting residential districts.
B. Definitions. See § 490-107. Cross-Reference: RSA 151 and RSA 151-C
contain specific definitions of residential care and health facilities
requiring licensing. Applicants for development of projects in the
Seniors Housing Overlay District must comply with all state and federal
regulations applicable to these facilities. [Added by the 1999 Town
Meeting]
C. District locations. The primary intent of applying an overlay to
established districts is to provide a compatible location for senior
housing projects. Senior facility developers and operators may apply for
any of the defined senior uses in § 490-107; however, the Planning
Board shall have the sole authority for approval of a proposed project
for a particular site based on the standards and criteria noted in this
section. [Amended by the 2002 Town Meeting]
(1) A senior housing overlay district may be established on any parcel,
or combination of parcels, that has the following characteristics:
(a) A total land area appropriate to the use as set forth in
Subsection F below, unless otherwise waived by the Planning
Board, consistent with the interests of the community.
(b) Served by municipal sewer and water or by private systems
approved for community use by the Planning Board and the
State of New Hampshire.
(c) Having frontage on an existing or proposed Class V Town road
of at least 200 feet, or access to a Class V Town road through
§ 490-601 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-601
1:539
an adjoining commercially zoned or business-office property
with conforming frontage on a Class V Town road.
(d) Commercial-Industrial A or C Subdistrict, or abutting or
adjoining commercially zoned land, or Business-Office
Districts. [Amended by the 2004 Town Meeting]
(e) Town Center District.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Planning Board may approve
placement of an overlay in any rurally or residentially zoned area
after employing the development standards in Subsection F.
D. Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted in the Seniors
Housing Overlay District: [Amended by the 2002 Town Meeting]
(1) A variety of housing types exclusively addressing the needs of
senior citizens, including but not limited to active adult homes and
facilities; independent living facilities; continuing care retirement
communities; assisted living facilities; congregate care facilities;
nursing homes; and skilled nursing facilities.
(2) Only single-family detached dwellings shall be allowed in the
Residential and Rural Districts. [Added by the 2004 Town
Meeting]
E. Evaluation criteria. In considering plans submitted under this section,
the Planning Board shall take into consideration the public health,
safety and general welfare and the comfort and convenience of the
public in general and the residents of the immediate neighborhood in
particular and shall make any appropriate conditions and safeguards in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of this section, and
particularly in regard to achieving: [Added by the 2002 Town
Meeting]
(1) Maximum safety of traffic access and egress, minimum on the
capacity of existing roads and sufficient parking areas to provide
for adequate off-street parking.
(2) A site layout which would have no adverse effect upon any
properties in adjoining residential districts by impairing the
established character or the potential use of properties in such
districts.
(3) The reasonable screening of all parking lots, service areas, and
multifamily housing developments from the view of adjacent
residential properties and streets.
(4) Conformance of the proposed plan with the Salem Master Plan.
(5) Installation of public improvements and amenities, at the expense
of the applicant, to assist in the establishment of a sound urban
environment. Such improvements may include, but shall not be
§ 490-601 SALEM CODE § 490-601
1:540
limited to, granite curbing, sidewalks and street trees, extension
of utilities and, when deemed necessary, improvements to existing
roadways and/or drainage systems in order to adequately serve the
proposed project.
(6) Conformance of the building and all related signs and structures to
the properties of the aesthetic character of the area, as determined
by consideration of architecture, building size and type, scale of lot
coverage, and consistency of uses in the immediate area.
F. Development standards.
(1) General standards.
(a) Zoning dimensions (minimum acreage, frontage, setbacks,
height restriction): see § 490-202.
(b) Seniors facilities must be served by municipal water and sewer
or by private systems approved for community use by the
Planning Board and the State of New Hampshire.
(c) Facilities designed as dwelling units within the district may
have a maximum of two bedrooms.
(d) Open space shall consist of no less than 50% of the lot area.
(2) Design and architectural character.
(a) Massing and style. Building massing and style must be
distinctively residential in character, drawing on the historical
design elements that are contextually consistent with regional
New England architecture. Historical and traditional design
elements are encouraged. Front yards which use boxwood
hedges, evergreen hedges, traditional style picket fences,
stone walls, or iron picket fences with granite curb and
pilasters are encouraged. Fences or hedges should not exceed
three feet in height at the fronts of buildings. Fences and
landscaping to screen service areas may exceed this height,
consistent with the intent and use of the space.
(b) Roofs. Preference shall be given to roof pitches consistent with
single-family residential design. New England traditional or
vernacular styles are preferred. Material must be consistent
with the architecture of the building. Composition shingle
material is acceptable, provided that it is of high quality and
provides architectural definition to the tab shingle to emulate
traditional wood shingle styles. Tile, slate, or metal roofing is
permitted, provided that it is consistent with the architectural
style of the building. Gutters and downspouts are encouraged
to provide drainage away from foundations but must be
consistent with the other architectural elements of the
building. The installation of chimneys on the roofs of all
§ 490-601 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-601
1:541
buildings is encouraged to convey the look and feel of
residential use.
(c) Facade element. Design of the facade shall be highly detailed
and articulated to be compatible with the scale and sensitivity
to the residential uses of the project. Facades should have a
well-defined foundation, a modulated wall element, and
pitched roof or articulated cornice which defines the character
of the building and provides relation to the human scale of
typical family residences.
(d) Entrances. Building entrances must comply with all current
accessibility regulations; however, the use of ramps and lifts is
discouraged. Buildings should be designed with entrances that
are barrier free for the intended residential or commercial
uses. The use of sloping entry walks, covered entryways,
porticos, arcades, and covered porches is encouraged. Where
grade separation of an entrance is required because of site
topography, accommodation should be provided in the
architectural detail of the entry to allow barrier-free use by
building residents and visitors.
(e) Door and window openings. Doors and windows form the
transition from public to private space and should reflect
residential detailing in design and placement. The use of
cornices, architectural moldings, side lights, transom lights,
and raised panels in doors is encouraged. Window openings
should vary between buildings but should not be unbroken and
continuous in any circumstance. The use of opening sash
windows with true divided lights or detailing to convey the
character of divided lights is encouraged. The use of shutters
consistent with the architecture of a building is encouraged. A
wide range of material for doors and windows is acceptable,
except that the use of commercial, anodized or painted
aluminum or steel storefront assemblies is discouraged.
(f) Materials and design elements. Material chosen for exterior
elements should be consistent with the intent and use of
materials traditionally found in residential design in New
England. Siding materials such as clapboard and shingle are
preferred, and the use of new materials which reduce
maintenance but emulate the look and feel of traditional
materials is encouraged. The use of a variety of trim material
to provide detail at the eaves, corners, gables, pediments,
lintels, sills, quoins, and balustrades is encouraged. The use of
bays, towers, cupolas, cross gables, and dormers to provide
unique character to a building and provide articulation of the
facade is encouraged. The color palette chosen for any building
should be consistent with traditional residential colors.
§ 490-601 SALEM CODE § 490-601
1:542
(g) Paving and curbing. Granite curbing, gray in color, is required
on all public roads and is preferred, except in areas of very low
traffic volume where no curbing will be required. Rolled
asphalt (Cape Cod berm) curbing is unacceptable in all public
ways. Curbing is to be sloped or cut to provide a barrier-free
transition at road crossings and building entrances. Paving
which provides a nonskid surface and is contrasting in design,
materials, or color is encouraged at all pedestrian crosswalks
and walkways.
(h) Parking. Parking lots in front setbacks are prohibited. Parking
areas are to be to the side or rear of all buildings. Parking lot
layout shall be planned to permit landscaping, buffering, or
screening to prevent direct views of parked vehicles from
adjacent streets. The use of traditional picket fencing, hedges,
walls, or landscape berms to define parking areas is
encouraged. Parking lot interiors shall be landscaped to
provide shade and relief. In parking areas of 11 or more
parking stalls, at least one tree of three-inch or greater caliper
shall be planted for every six parking places. Adequate tree
wells and irrigation shall be provided for all parking lot
landscaping. Pedestrian access is to be taken into
consideration in parking lot design. The use of separate
walkways is encouraged. Textured paving or grade-separated
(elevated) walkways are desired on all pedestrian accessways.
Separate loading areas are required for service vehicles in all
residential projects of 20 or more units and at all other
facilities greater than 2,500 square feet. In multifamily
buildings of 20 or more units, at least one loading area must be
provided for 20 to 50 units and one additional loading area for
each additional increment of 25 units. In other facilities,
loading areas must be provided at the ratio of one space for
each 10,000 square feet of building area on a site, except that
all activities of 2,500 square feet or more shall have at least
one loading area provided. Loading areas must be at least 20
feet by nine feet and have a minimum overhead clearance of 10
feet. Screening and landscaping shall be provided to block all
views of loading areas (except those specifically designated for
emergency vehicles) from the public right-of-way and adjacent
properties.
(i) Parking ratios shall be as follows:
Use Ratio per Dwelling Unit
Adult community 2.2:1
Independent living
facilities
1.5:1
CCRC 2:1
ALF 1:1 plus 1:each employee

Nursing home 0.25:1 plus 1:each employee
SNF 0.25:1 plus 1:each employee
Alzheimer's facility 0.25:1 plus 1:each employee
(j) Signs. Permitted signs are to be as specified in § 490-702D(1)
for Residential, Rural, Recreational or Garden Apartment
Districts.
(k) Lighting. Multi-halide lighting or color-corrected sodium
lighting is encouraged. Streetlighting, except as required for
vehicle entrances and public rights-of-way in the Subdivision
Regulations, should be pedestal mounted or mounted on
adjacent buildings at pedestrian-scale heights between 10 and
14 feet. Lights should not illuminate adjacent properties, and
caps or cutoffs must be provided to prevent direct lighting of
abutting or adjacent properties. The use of porch lights,
gatepost lights, and bollard lighting to illuminate walkways is
encouraged.
(l) Foundation planting and general landscaping. A broad range of
foundation plants and general landscape planting is
encouraged. The intent is to provide an intensity of
landscaping that creates a residential character for any project
in this district.
(3) Development density. [Amended by the 2002, 2003 and 2004
Town Meetings]
(a) Maximum allowable density shall be based on project location
as follows: [Amended by the 2017 and 2018 Town
Meetings]
[1] Commercial-Industrial Districts: five units per acre.
[2] Town Center District: four units per acre.
[3] Residential Districts: same as underlying district.
[4] Business-Office Districts: two units per acre.
[5] Rural Districts: same as underlying district.
(b) A density bonus of up to 10% of the total units allowed above
may be granted by the Planning Board for projects which
restrict the age of all occupants to age 62 and older. An
additional density bonus of up to 10% may be granted by the
Planning Board for projects of any size which dedicate a
greater percentage of affordable units than required in
§ 490-601 SALEM CODE § 490-601
1:544
Subsection H(5), but in no case may the total density bonus
exceed 20% of the total units otherwise allowed.
(c) Density calculations shall be based on the amount of
contiguous upland area of a lot.
(4) Open space requirements. Land within the parcel or lot which is
not specifically covered by the buildings, roads, driveways, parking
areas, or service areas, and not set aside as private yards, patios, or
gardens for residents, shall qualify as open space. Private yards
shall be considered to encompass all property within 20 feet of the
dwelling or building. Further, all open space shall be unobstructed
and open to the sky. Flagpoles, sculptures, benches, swimming
pools, tennis courts, atriums, trees, and similar objects shall not be
considered obstructions. No more than 25% of the minimum
required open space may lie within a wetland. At least 50% of the
required open space must be undisturbed land that remains in its
natural state. The size, dimension, character, and location of open
space shall be suitable to enable its enjoyment and use for
conservation, recreation, or agricultural purposes by residents of
the community. Such restrictions regarding open space shall be in a
form and substance as the Planning Board may prescribe, and shall
be recorded in an instrument enforceable by the Town. [Amended
by the 2017 Town Meeting]
(5) Single-family detached dwelling units may be situated on individual
lots, may be part of a detached condominium regime, or may be
separate rental units. Single-family detached projects within the
district require a minimum parcel size of 10 acres. In the case of
condominium units, condominium projects must be 75% owneroccupied.
If separate lots are created, they shall not be less than
10,000 square feet and may have frontage on either Town roads or
private roads within the overlay district, in which case the roads
shall be maintained by an owners' association. In the case of singlefamily
detached dwellings, the density of a district may not exceed
one unit for each 10,000 square feet of lot area.
(6) Multifamily residential structures may be either condominium units
or rental units, except that condominium units must be 75% owneroccupied.
More than one structure may be built on a lot in
accordance with the density limits for the project type.
G. Special use permits. The implementation of Seniors Overlay Districts
shall be overseen by the Town of Salem Planning Board. Under the
provisions of RSA 674:21, the Planning Board may, by application for a
special use permit, provide an exception from the development
standards in Subsection F, provided that:
(1) Such exception is consistent with the purpose and intent of this
section.
§ 490-601 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-601
1:545
(2) The exception is in the public interest.
(3) The exception will not aggravate or worsen the impact on adjoining
residential areas.
(4) The exception will provide a development opportunity that could
not be otherwise obtained.
H. Restrictions.
(1) Residential facilities designed for exclusive occupancy by senior
citizens, as a minimum, must meet federal regulations for such
facilities.
(2) All occupants shall be age 55 or older. [Amended by the 2004
Town Meeting]
(3) A unit occupied by surviving members of a household, in which the
head of household met the age requirements at time of death, may
continue to be occupied by surviving household members
regardless of age.
(4) Residency restrictions for residential projects within the Seniors
Housing Overlay District shall be accomplished by restrictions
recorded in condominium declarations, restrictive covenants, or
other documents recorded in the Rockingham Registry of Deeds.
All such covenants shall be subject to review by Town Counsel and
shall include enforcement provisions in favor of the Town.
(5) At least 10% of the total dwelling units in all projects shall be
dedicated as affordable to low-income households, defined as being
available at a cost of no more than 30% of gross household income
of households at or below 80% of the Lawrence, MA PMSA - NH
Portion median income as reported by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. As an alternative to providing
these units, the Planning Board may allow an applicant to
contribute a fee to a local housing trust fund to be used for the
development of affordable senior housing. The fee shall be
equivalent in value to the units which otherwise would have been
provided within the development, in accordance with a fee
schedule adopted by the Salem Planning Board, and shall be paid
on a timetable approved by the Board. [Amended by the 2004,
2007 and 2017 Town Meetings]
(6) Pursuant to RSA 674:21, I(b), to ensure that the rate of growth of
new dwelling units does not unreasonably interfere with the Town's
capacity for planned, orderly, and sensible expansion of its services
to accommodate such growth, the construction of new dwelling
units approved under this section shall be phased so that no more
than 20 single-family detached units or 50 multifamily units shall
be built in any one project per year. [Added by the 2004 Town
Meeting; amended by the 2008 Town Meeting]

§ 490-602. Depot Village Overlay District. [Added by the 2011 Town
Meeting]
A. Purpose. It is the purposed of this overlay district to:
(1) Encourage development in the Depot of a mixed-use environment
that is less automobile dependent and more pedestrian friendly.
(2) Encourage a diverse mix of business, commercial, office,
residential, institutional and entertainment uses for workers,
visitors, and residents.
(3) Limit and discourage development of highway-oriented strip
commercial uses that create traffic hazards and congestion
because they require numerous individual curb cuts and generally
higher traffic volumes.
(4) Encourage a pedestrian-friendly environment and pedestrianoriented
commercial enterprises and consumer services.
(5) Minimize visual and functional conflicts between residential and
nonresidential uses within and abutting the district.
(6) Allow for more compact development than may be permitted in
other zoning districts to reduce the impacts of sprawl and traffic
congestion.
(7) Allow for an appropriate density of land uses to achieve a critical
mass of people and activities needed to support vibrant Depot
Village developments.
B. Applicability and administration.
(1) The Depot Village Overlay District is hereby established and
consists of those areas shown on the Town of Salem Zoning Map on
file with the Town Clerk. The district boundaries are as indicated on
the Zoning Map. The Depot Village Overlay District encompasses
land located within the following underlying zoning districts:
Commercial-Industrial A, B and C, Business-Office I, Industrial, and
Residential. The provisions of this overlay district are
superimposed over the underlying existing zoning districts.
Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to use the provisions
of this overlay district.
(2) The Planning Board shall be the permit granting authority for the
Depot Village Overlay District and is responsible for administering
this section as an innovative land use pursuant to RSA 674:21.
(3) Since this section grants broad authority to the Planning Board to
modify underlying zoning restrictions to facilitate development in
the Depot, the Board may reject or require modification of plans
which it finds would have an unanticipated or undesirable impact
on the community or are not suitable for the sites on which they are
§ 490-602 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-602
1:547
proposed. If a plan is rejected, the Planning Board shall state the
reasons for the rejection and offer suggestions for modifications to
the plan that would make it acceptable, after which the applicant
may submit a revised plan for the Planning Board's consideration.
(4) Conditional use permits. [Amended by the 2014 Town Meeting]
(a) The Planning Board may grant conditional use permits to
modify the requirements and standards in Subsections D, E, F
[except Subsection F(5)], G, and H of this section in limited
respects, provided that the Board finds that all of the following
criteria are met:
[1] The modification complies with the purposes of the district
noted in Subsection A;
[2] The applicant's particular situation justifies a modification
to the requirements;
[3] The site is suitable for the proposed modification;
[4] There will be no adverse impact on neighboring
properties;
[5] There will be no adverse impact on traffic or pedestrian
safety;
[6] The aesthetic character of the site and the surrounding
area will not be adversely affected; and
[7] The modification will be consistent with the spirit and
intent of this chapter and the Master Plan.

Planning Board may, in its discretion, decline to grant it if the
Board determines such permit is not justified or warranted.
(c) This provision is adopted as an innovative land use control
pursuant to RSA 674:21 and the Planning Board is vested with
sole authority to administer it and to grant conditional use
permits.
C. Review procedure.
(1) Applicants seeking approval to develop a project pursuant to this
section are encouraged to meet with the Planning Board prior to
submitting a formal application to the Board. The purpose of the

(b) Conditional use permit. The Planning Board may grant a
conditional use permit to reduce this requirement to 50% of
178. Editor's Note: So in original.
§ 490-602 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-602
1:551
what would be required in § 490-701 if it finds that the criteria
in § 490-701D and these additional criteria are met:
[1] Submission of a reciprocal agreement executed by the
owners and operators of the different sources or uses (to
be recorded in the Registry of Deeds) ensuring the longterm
joint use of such shared parking, and defining the
terms upon which the parking is shared;
[2] Submission of the following information:
[a] The hours of operation and parking demand for each
use;
[b] The hours of peak demand for parking;
[c] A description of the character of the land use and the
parking patterns of adjacent uses;
[d] An estimate of the anticipated turnover in parking
space use over a twenty-four-hour period of time;
[e] A site plan showing all proposed parking spaces,
including the shared use spaces in the lot and the
walking distance to the uses sharing the lot; and
[f] Any other information concerning parking deemed
necessary by the Planning Board to render a decision;
and
[3] A determination shall be made by the Planning Board that:
[a] The shared parking is no more than 500 feet from
each use sharing the parking facility;
[b] Hours of operation and peak demand of the uses
involved shall not conflict; and
[c] The shared parking will provide an adequate number
of spaces for the applicable uses.
G. Curb cuts.
(1) Developments shall be designed in a manner that minimizes the
number of curb cuts on primary streets. To the extent feasible,
access to businesses shall be provided through one of the following
methods:
(a) From an existing side or rear street or public alley, thus
avoiding the principal thoroughfare; or
(b) From a common driveway serving one or more adjacent
properties.
§ 490-602 SALEM CODE § 490-602
1:552
(2) The Planning Board may deny a curb cut if the proposed
development is inconsistent with the following guidelines:
(a) Curb cuts shall be limited to one unless the Board feels that
due to large parcel size an additional cut is justified.
(b) When access is available from a public alley the Board may
deny a curb cut from a primary street.
(c) Shared drives are encouraged between adjacent parcels when
appropriate.
(d) Curb cuts shall not be greater than 36 feet long.
H. Performance standards.
(1) Pedestrian and bicycle access. Provision for safe and convenient
pedestrian access shall be incorporated into plans for new
construction of buildings and parking areas and should be designed
in concert with landscaping plans noted below. Site plans in the
Depot Village Overlay District should provide for continuity from
sidewalks in public streets to all pedestrian entrances on the site,
and walkability should be given primary importance over road
speed and other access criteria. New construction should improve
pedestrian access to buildings, sidewalks and parking areas and
should be completed with consideration of pedestrian safety,
handicapped access and visual quality. Where appropriate,
applicants are encouraged to provide pedestrian and/or bicycle
paths (or connection to the proposed bicycle rail trail) connecting
the site with abutting areas in order to promote pedestrian and
bicycle circulation and safety in the Depot Village. When parking is
located in the rear, pedestrian access via a pedestrian-oriented
alley or walkway through to the primary street is encouraged.
Bicycle and pedestrian access that provides connections between
developments should be established. Connections with the rail trail
should also be provided.
(2) Landscaping. Landscaping shall be incorporated into new and
redeveloped properties in such a way as to create visual relief and
interest, provide shade for pedestrian areas and to screen parking
and loading areas. Landscape plans shall be prepared by a
registered landscape architect unless the Board finds that the plans
submitted are consistent with the intent of this regulation and meet
the specific guidelines as set forth herein. Landscape plans shall
show the location, type, and size of all proposed plantings as well as
enough of the surrounding context such that the Board may
determine the plan's appropriateness.
(a) Side yard treatment.
§ 490-602 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-602
1:553
[1] Where the distance between structures on adjacent lots is
10 feet or less, the side yard shall be landscaped with
grass and plantings.
[2] Where the distance between structures on adjacent lots is
greater than 10 feet, landscaping shall consist of a
combination of materials sufficient to break up the view
into the side yard, but, for safety reasons, in no case
should this planting be impermeable; or
[3] Side yards may, in the alternative, be established as
pedestrian walkways to access parking areas to the rear of
the building. Such walkways shall be landscaped and
lighted for safety.
(b) Parking areas.
[1] Large parking areas shall be relieved by landscaped
islands of a minimum of five feet in width, equal in depth to
the depth of a typical parking space and located such that
there is one island per 15 continuous spaces;
[2] Alternatively, at least 5% of the interior area of the lot shall
be devoted to landscaping. Areas described in the above
shall have at a minimum one shade tree with a minimum
caliper of three inches diameter at breast height (dbh).
Trees planted in such locations shall be planted in
protected pervious areas which have a minimum
dimension of five feet; and
[3] Where parking lots abut public rights-of-way, shade trees
with a minimum caliper of three inches shall be provided
within a planting strip no less than five feet in width and at
a rate of one tree per every 10 continuous spaces.
(c) Trash and service areas.
[1] All service, loading and trash storage areas viewable from
a public right-of-way or from an adjacent residential area
shall be screened by one or a combination of masonry,
wood fencing, or evergreen plantings to reduce their
visual impact;
[2] Loading and service areas shall not face any residential
area unless no other location is possible. Loading areas
shall be subject to screening requirements stated herein;
[3] Garage doors and loading spaces are prohibited on the
front facade of any building unless no other location is
feasible; and
[4] Hours of operation for deliveries and trash pickup shall be
restricted to minimize impacts on nearby residences.
§ 490-602 SALEM CODE § 490-602
1:554
(3) Design regulations.
(a) Orientation. Buildings shall be oriented parallel to the front
property line to preserve a consistent facade line with the
street. Primary building entrances should be easily identified
and be oriented to the street. The primary entry should be
clearly visible from the public street which provides the
building's main orientation.
(b) Articulation.
[1] New and redeveloped buildings should reinforce the
character of the existing streetscape by creating visual
interest and reinforcing pedestrian scale. The apparent
bulk and large wall expanses of multistory buildings as
well as single-story buildings of 15 feet in height or more
should be minimized by incorporating one or preferably a
combination of the following:
[a] Windows;
[b] Architectural details;
[c] Canopies;
[d] Overhangs;
[e] Indented bays; and
[f] Change of building materials.
[2] The top of such buildings should display a distinct profile
or outline incorporating such elements as a projecting
parapet, cornice, upper level setback or pitched roofline.
When immediately adjacent a building with such
articulation, new and redeveloped buildings should
provide a treatment that is respectful, such as providing a
consistent cornice line where possible.
[3] Large expanses of blank walls are prohibited for
commercial and mixed-use buildings. The ground floor
facade along the primary street shall have continuous
storefront windows, with the exception of necessary piers,
columns, pilasters, doors, etc.
(c) Transparency. For commercial and mixed-use buildings, a
minimum of 60% of the building facade oriented to the street
must be comprised of clear windows that provide views to
indoor retail space, dining space or product areas when
applicable. Where parking occupies the ground floor, the same
solid to void ratio must be achieved utilizing techniques such
as half walls, grillwork, or landscaped trelliswork or their
equal.
§ 490-602 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-602
1:555
(d) Doors and entrances.
[1] Buildings must have a primary entrance facing a public
street or way and should be visually prominent; and
[2] In buildings with multiple ground floor tenants, entries
should provide a coordinated design theme, i.e., a common
canopy, architectural projection or awning design.
(e) Pedestrian spaces and comfort.
[1] For the purpose of providing a pedestrian-friendly
environment in the Depot Village Overlay District, new and
redeveloped buildings should provide for outdoor seating
areas, scaled to the size and demands of the proposed use,
where feasible. For example, a large, multistory project
should provide a patio or small plaza area located near the
front entry with multiple benches and landscaping. A
mixed-use project with ground floor retail such as a
restaurant may provide an area for outdoor dining which
extends the indoor dining space for seasonal use. A ground
floor use may provide a sidewalk bench where there is
sufficient width.
[2] Such pedestrian areas are best located when they take
advantage of southern exposure and provide space that
affords visual connectivity but is set back from major
pedestrian flow and vehicular ways and is appropriate to
the location.
[3] Outdoor sales and display areas should be well organized
and located such as not to impede pedestrian circulation if
located on a public walk or way.
[4] The following guidelines should be considered in the
design and location of pedestrian spaces:
[a] Flexible design to allow for flexible use;
[b] Buffering from major vehicular areas such as parking
lots or main trafficways;
[c] Lighting for nighttime comfort and safety;
[d] Appropriate street furnishing (i.e., benches, trash
receptacles);
[e] A focal element where appropriate such as a water
feature, special landscape feature or public art
installation;
[f] Decorative paving and seasonal planting;
[g] South facing locations;
§ 490-602 SALEM CODE § 490-602
1:556
[h] Visual connectivity, especially to important views such
as an historic structure; and
[i] Appropriately scaled to the development.
(f) Utilities. Underground utilities for new and redeveloped
buildings are required unless physically restricted or blocked
by existing underground obstructions.
(g) Lighting.
[1] Site lighting, security lighting and architectural/landscape
lighting should provide the user with illumination levels
appropriate for the designed activity (i.e. parking, walking,
outdoor dining) while meeting minimum requirements.
Illumination levels should also be reasonably uniform
throughout the site and strive to minimize glare.
[2] Light fixtures should be designed to reflect the traditional
character of New England villages or downtowns.
[3] Adequate lighting levels should be provided in all
pedestrian areas, including building entries, along
walkways, parking areas, and other public areas. Lighting
plans should provide for:
[a] An overlapping pattern of light at a height of about 10
to 15 feet in lighted areas;
[b] Lighting at consistent lumens with a gradual
transition to unlighted areas. Highly contrasting pools
of light and dark can be temporarily blinding and
should be avoided;
[c] In each lighted area, design lighting levels that will
allow pedestrians to identify a face 15 yards away
(generally, a minimum of four footcandles). Adequate
lighting reduces anonymity and gives pedestrians an
opportunity to choose another route;
[d] Adequate lighting at all building entrances, exits and
corridors between buildings, at least four footcandles
during active use, especially where doors are
recessed;
[e] Confine site lighting to the project site; use shields or
other methods to eliminate glare on adjacent
properties;
[f] Place light posts and standards so that they do not
create hazards for pedestrians or vehicles;
§ 490-602 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-602
1:557
[g] Indicate specific lighting levels in each lighted area;
and
[h] Address potential impacts of lighting on residential
abutters and neighbors.
(h) Quality of site furnishings. Provide for the following site plan
elements:
[1] High-quality materials in site furnishings and features,
such as durable and easily maintained walls and paving;
[2] Site features and furnishings that discourage vandalism.
Furnishings that are easily removed or do not convey an
image of care invite misuse; and
[3] Safe materials, such as nonslip walkway surfaces.
(i) Signs.
[1] Signs should be designed to be compatible with the
intended nature of Depot Village (e.g., pedestrian-scaled).
[2] Sign materials in the Depot Village Overlay District should
include traditional-looking materials such as wood, brass,
bronze, or similar materials. Wooden signs should be
constructed of dense wood that will accept paint readily.
[3] The number and size of signs shall meet requirements set
forth in § 490-702.
[4] All freestanding signs shall be monument signs no more
than six feet in height.
[5] All wall signs shall be individual letters.
[6] All sign illumination shall be external. Neon, fluorescent,
and LED lighting is not allowed. Sign lighting shall comply
with § 490-702D(2)(i).
(j) Snow storage/removal. Adequate areas for snow storage
should be provided. Removal and off-site storage may be
required if adequate on-site areas are not available.
(k) Accessibility. State and federal regulations on accessibility
shall be met.
I. Traffic management.
(1) The traffic management regulations in the Site Plan Review
Regulations shall apply.
(2) Applicants shall be required to implement the road connections and
improvements outlined in the Depot Redevelopment Plan, as
adopted by the Planning Board.

(2) In accordance with RSA 674:21, I(i), the intent of these provisions
is to promote flexibility in development and redevelopment of
parcels in the Commercial-Industrial District B and Industrial
District in the vicinity of Interstate 93. The process allows flexibility
for projects which meet the criteria in Article IV to be proposed
largely independent from current land use regulations, including
the selection of land uses, density, setbacks, buffers, building
heights, lot sizes, lot dimensions, and parking requirements
otherwise applicable to the property.
C. Conditional use permits. The Planning Board may grant conditional use
permits to vary the provisions of §§ 490-501 and 490-502 (permitted
uses and restrictions), and § 490-701 (Off-street parking and loading),
consistent with the objectives and criteria below. An applicant is not
entitled to a conditional use permit, and the Planning Board may, in its
discretion, decline to grant such permit if the Board determines that
such permit is not justified or warranted in accordance with the below
objectives and criteria and the purpose of this section. This section is
adopted as an innovative land use control pursuant to RSA 674:21, II,
and the Planning Board is vested with sole authority to administer it
and to grant the conditional use permits described herein. All other
zoning regulations shall apply.

Business Innovation Overlay District, the applicant/owner shall be
§ 490-603 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-603
1:559
required to prepare a conceptual development plan for the entire
parcel even if construction is to be phased. The conceptual
development plan shall show existing site conditions and proposed
development, including the general types, locations and intensities
of proposed land uses and proposed traffic and pedestrian flows,
and shall generally indicate how the proposed development of
the site will impact municipal services and facilities and abutting
properties.

plan shall meet the following objectives and criteria:
(a) Encourage the aggregation of smaller existing properties as
well as the redevelopment of older commercial and industrial
properties;
(b) Encourage a campus-like development pattern (with
interconnected buildings, parking, pedestrian access, and
open space) which provides an alternative to conventional
commercial-industrial development;
(c) Encourage new roadway configurations, connections and
access methods that enable improved access and facilitate
vehicle movement without degrading intersection function
and/or creating bottlenecks;
(d) Encourage complementary and integrated uses such as retail,
residential and commercial that are co-located within a single
building;
(e) Allow complementary retail uses (e.g. banking, coffee shop,
dry cleaner, etc.) as part of a mixed-use development to serve
office/industrial employees that are fully integrated into the
primary building structure;
(f) Allow limited multifamily residential uses (condominiums,
apartments, etc.) that do not exceed 20% of the total gross
floor area on a site as part of a mixed-use development that are
physically integrated with and complementary to the primary
building structure(s);
(g) Avoid freestanding and/or standalone retail and residential
uses;
(h) Mitigate negative impacts on traffic, public utilities, municipal
services, and natural resources;
(i) Provide high-quality site planning, architectural, landscaping,
lighting, and signage designs that meet the Town of Salem
Design Guidelines;

1:560
access to avoid the need to use vehicles to access other
buildings and/or properties;
(k) Establish open space amenities, including usable common
land, outdoor plazas, greens, or parks.
(l) Buffer residential areas from commercial-industrial
encroachment. No building, parking lot or other improvements
shall be located within 100 feet of residentially or rurally zoned
land if such residentially or rurally zoned land is not separated
by a public way;
(m) Prohibit commercial-industrial access onto Brookdale Road
and Brady Avenue;
(n) Limit building height to 75 feet (NOTE: Building height shall be
calculated in accordance with the New Hampshire State
Building Code, as amended.);
(o) At least 20% of the total parking on a site must be located in
parking decks, below-grade parking garages, or at grade
parking incorporated into a building;
(p) Be consistent with the Salem Master Plan.
(3) The Planning Board shall have sole authority for approval of a
conceptual development plan based on the criteria noted above.
The Planning Board shall have the authority and ability to deny a
conceptual development plan if it deems the plan to be unsuitable,
undesirable or inconsistent with the vision and purpose of this
section. The Board may approve amendments or revisions to a
previously approved conceptual development plan. All subsequent
site plans and subdivisions submitted to the Planning Board for
approval within the parcel shall conform to the conceptual
development plan and these provisions and the Site Plan Review
Regulations. The Planning Board may adopt additional
performance standards for Innovation District projects. The
construction standards in the Subdivision Regulations, the Town of
Salem Design Guidelines, and the Traffic Management Regulations
shall apply.
E. Waivers. The Planning Board may grant waivers to modify the
requirements and standards in Subsection D of this section in limited
respects, provided the Board finds that all of the following criteria are
met:
(1) The modification complies with the purposes of the Business
Innovation Overlay District;
(2) The applicant's particular situation justifies a modification to the
requirements and benefits the overall Business Innovation Overlay
District and the Town of Salem;

§ 490-702 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-702
1:573
§ 490-703. Workforce housing. [Added by the 2010 Town Meeting]
(d) There will be no adverse impact on neighboring properties.
(e) There will be no adverse impact on traffic or pedestrian safety.
(f) The aesthetic character of the site and the surrounding area
will not be adversely affected.
(g) The modification will be consistent with the spirit and intent of
this chapter and the Master Plan.
(2) An applicant is not entitled to a conditional use permit, and the
Planning Board may, in its discretion, decline to grant it if the
Board determines such permit is not justified or warranted in
accordance with the above criteria.
(3) This provision is adopted as an innovative land use control
pursuant to RSA 674:21, and the Planning Board is vested with sole
authority to administer it and to grant the conditional use permits.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote and provide for the
development of workforce housing in the Town of Salem as provided for
in RSA 674:58 to 674:61. It is intended to ensure the continued
availability of a broad spectrum of home ownership and tenancy
opportunities for individuals and families with moderate income. All
workforce housing proposed to be developed in the Town of Salem shall
be approved and developed in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
B. Authority. This section is adopted under the authority of the Workforce
Housing Statute (RSA 674:58 to 674:61) and the Innovative Zoning
Statute (RSA 674:21).
C. Applicability. The following provisions apply to the terms of this section:
(1) The innovative land uses allowed under this section function as
permitted variations of the underlying zoning requirements, by
conditional use permit administered by the Planning Board, to the
general requirements of this chapter solely for the purposes stated
in Subsection A above. Provisions of this section shall not be
applied for any other purpose.
(2) Variances to the requirements of this section, including increased
residential densities, without having received a conditional use
permit under this section, shall be considered contrary to the spirit
of this section.
D. Administration. This section shall be administered by the Planning
Board. The Planning Board shall amend subdivision and site plan
regulations as provided by RSA 675:6 to include procedures for
administering the provisions of this section.
§ 490-702 SALEM CODE § 490-703
1:574
E. Restrictions. The following restrictions govern the Planning Board's
implementation of this section:
(1) The number of additional/bonus housing units authorized to be
constructed under provisions of this section in any calendar year
shall not exceed 1% of the existing housing supply. Additional
housing units are defined as residences in excess of the number
which could be constructed at the density permitted for singlefamily
detached housing in the underlying district.
(2) No single project or group of projects will have an unreasonable or
disproportionate impact on the environment, traffic, schools,
recreation areas, requirements for public services, or property
rights. Impact shall be considered disproportionate if it is
substantially greater per unit of housing than that for housing
constructed under provisions of the underlying district.
(3) The design of housing to be constructed under this section shall be
controlled to ensure that requirements of this subsection are
maintained. Expansion of housing contrary to provisions of this
subsection shall not be permitted, and variances to permit such
expansion shall be contrary to the spirit of this section.
(4) Since this section grants broad authority to the Planning Board to
facilitate development of workforce housing in Salem, the Planning
Board is granted discretion to reject or require modification of
plans which it finds would have an unanticipated or undesirable
impact on the community. If a plan is rejected, the Planning Board
shall state the reasons for the rejection and offer suggestions for
modifications to the plan that would make it acceptable, after
which the applicant may submit a revised plan for the Planning
Board's consideration.
(5) Affordability for home ownership shall be based on housing costs,
including mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance, not
exceeding 30% of the household income for a family of four persons
with an annual income that does not exceed 100% of the area
median income as determined annually by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. Affordability for housing rental
shall be based on monthly rental and utility costs not exceeding
30% of the household income for a three-person household with an
annual income that does not exceed 60% of the area median
income as determined annually by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
F. Procedure.
(1) An applicant desiring to develop under the provisions of this
section shall file an application with the Planning Board on forms
prescribed by it in regulations adopted pursuant to Subsection D.
Said application shall include a written statement of the applicant's
§ 490-703 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-703
1:575
intent to develop workforce housing and how the applicant intends
to comply with the terms and conditions of this section.
(2) The Planning Board shall review an application for a workforce
housing development in a manner consistent with its procedures
for other subdivision and/or site plan proposals.
(3) Final approval and review of considerations. Since one of the
objectives of this section is to provide long-term affordability of
units approved under this section, the Planning Board will be
mindful of potential added development costs that could impair the
affordability of the development. If the applicant for a project
reviewed under the provisions of this section believes that the
affordability of the project has been impaired as a result of the
conditions of project approval, the applicant may seek resolution of
these issues as provided for in RSA 674:60, II and III.
(4) The Planning Board is not required to allow a workforce housing
development that does not meet the Town's normal development
standards, required fees, or conditions of approval related to
environmental protection, water supply, sanitary disposal, traffic
safety, and fire and life safety protection.
G. Design criteria. The following provisions govern the design and
construction of workforce housing proposals under this section:
(1) Development in the Rural District is limited to single-family
detached and single-family attached (maximum of two units per
grouping) dwellings and uses incidental thereto situated on
development parcels that are at least five acres in size.
(2) Development in the Residential District is limited to single-family
detached and single-family attached (maximum of four units per
grouping) dwellings and uses incidental thereto situated on
development parcels that are at least five acres in size.
(3) Density.
(a) Density in the Residential District shall be based on either of
the following standards. Density in the Rural District shall be
based on the density bonus standards in the following
Subsection G(3)(a)[2]:
[1] The number of bedrooms shall be no more than 50%
greater than permitted on the basis of four bedrooms per
single-family detached dwelling in the underlying district.
In calculating permitted density, the fifty-percent increase
shall be applied to the number of single-family lots which
are shown on a conceptual subdivision or site plan meeting
all the requirements of the underlying district. All of the
units developed under this standard shall meet the
affordability requirements of Subsection E(5).
§ 490-703 SALEM CODE § 490-703
1:576
[2] The number of dwelling units shall be no more than 30%
greater than permitted in the underlying district. In
calculating permitted density, the thirty-percent increase
shall be applied to the number of single-family lots which
are shown on a conceptual subdivision or site plan meeting
all the requirements of the underlying district. All of the
bonus units developed under this standard shall meet the
affordability requirements of Subsection E(5).
(b) Units may be constructed with various numbers of bedrooms,
except that all of the units shall contain at least two bedrooms.
Furthermore, none of the units approved for a development
under this section may be age restricted.
(c) Any fractional product of the maximum dwelling unit density
calculation in Subsection G(3)(a) shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number if below 0.6, or rounded up to the
nearest whole number if 0.6 or above.
(4) Workforce housing constructed in Commercial-Industrial Districts
shall contain not less than 3,500 square feet of upland (nonwetland
soils) lot area for each dwelling unit that shall consist exclusively of
upland (nonwetland) soils. Such housing may be configured as onefamily
attached, townhouse, multifamily or mixed use. If a mix of
multifamily housing and permitted commercial-industrial uses is
proposed, calculation of the maximum residential density shall be
made after deducting the building footprint area for the
nonresidential uses. Such housing shall conform to the garden
apartment maximum lot coverage in § 490-202, plus applicable
requirements of § 490-304B, subject to exceptions as provided in
this section. All of the units developed under this standard shall
meet the affordability requirements of Subsection E(5).
(a) Units may be constructed with various numbers of bedrooms,
except that more than 50% of the units shall contain two or
more bedrooms. Furthermore, none of the units approved for a
development under this section may be age restricted.
(b) The Planning Board may permit multifamily workforce housing
developments that comply with the requirements of this
Subsection G(4) in other zoning districts if the following
additional criteria can be met to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board:
[1] Total development parcel size shall be a minimum of 10
acres.
[2] The development shall have a landscaped buffer around
the perimeter of the development that provides an
effective year-round visual screen between the
development and abutting properties.
§ 490-703 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-703
1:577
[3] The Planning Board finds that all of the other
requirements of this section are met.
[4] The development is substantially funded by state and/or
federal affordable housing programs that require longterm
housing affordability.
(5) Projects with a residential density greater than permitted by the
district wherein they are located will be served by the municipal
water and sewer systems or by private systems acceptable to the
Planning Board and State of New Hampshire.
(6) The Planning Board may require extension of roads and utilities,
construction of community facilities, dedication of land for public
purposes, and payment for off-site improvements to the extent that
they are reasonably necessitated by developments authorized
under provisions of this section.
(7) Developments which differ moderately from abutting residential
developments shall be visually buffered from them by distance and
vegetation.
(8) The plan shall comply with the lot requirements and design criteria
of the underlying district unless a conditional use permit is
specifically requested and voted by the Planning Board under
Subsection H.
(9) Workforce housing units shall be similar in exterior appearance to
market-rate units and dispersed throughout the development.
(10)Workforce housing units must be constructed in a sequence
proportional to the construction sequence of the market-rate units,
and all workforce housing units must be completed and made
available for sale or rental before the final 10% of the market-rate
units are approved for occupancy.
H. Conditional use permits. The Planning Board may grant a conditional
use permit for the development of workforce housing under this section
which results in a design that modifies the requirements of the
underlying district, subject to the following specific criteria:
(1) The proposed design or development is compatible with
surrounding neighborhoods, and no diminution of surrounding
property values will be suffered.
(2) The modifications are necessary to accomplish the purpose and
intent of this section.
(3) Modification of the requirements for maximum allowable height
that exceeds three stories, compliance with § 490-706, Wetlands
conservation, and to permit commercial development in
noncommercial districts shall not be permitted.
§ 490-703 SALEM CODE § 490-703
1:578
§ 490-704. Open space preservation. [Amended by the 1996 Town
Meeting]
(4) The plan meets all of the provisions of this section.
(5) The Salem Housing Authority, the New Hampshire Housing
Finance Authority or other similar organization has established
agreements with the applicant, subject to review and approval by
the Planning Board, to ensure that the purpose of this section will
be fulfilled and will continue to be fulfilled after the project is
completed, that the benefit to affordability will be commensurate
with the increased value resulting from the increased density
permitted by this section, and such agreements are an integral part
of the proposal. Agreements shall include provisions to enforce the
requirement of Subsection E(5). They may include agreements to
provide a share of equity in trust of the Salem Housing Authority,
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority or other similar
organization, restrictions related to the sale or rental price, resale,
or occupancy of the housing, and other provisions and conditions
consistent with development and allocation of a limited housing
resource, provided that said restrictions benefit the development
or retention of moderately priced housing in Salem.
(6) The applicant has demonstrated and the Planning Board has found
that the benefit to be gained from the project in providing
workforce housing outweighs any adverse impact on the
community or Town as a whole and that the project is in the public
interest. An applicant is not entitled to a conditional use permit,
and the Planning Board may, in its discretion, decline to grant it if
the Board determines such permit is not justified or warranted in
accordance with the above criteria.
I. Nonseverability. If any of the requirements, conditions, or discretionary
authority granted to the Salem Housing Authority, New Hampshire
Housing Finance Authority, or other similar organization, or to the
Planning Board, is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the
authority in this section to grant conditional use permits to permit
residential densities greater than permitted in the existing Residential
and Rural Districts shall be invalid.
A. General description. This section applies to the Residential and Rural
Districts.
(1) General concept. An open space preservation design (hereinafter
OSPD) shall mean a residential development in which the buildings
and accessory uses are located more closely together, with reduced
lot sizes, into one or more groups. All land not included in the
building lots or street rights-of-way shall be dedicated as
permanently preserved open space. The overall housing density
shall not exceed that which could be built under a conventional
development plan, except as noted below, and all lots must be
§ 490-703 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-704
1:579
serviced by municipal water and sewer or by private systems
acceptable to the Planning Board and State of New Hampshire.
[Amended by the 2003 Town Meeting]
(2) Permitted uses. Residential uses are limited to single-family
detached dwellings and accessory uses, including residential
additions, garages, sheds, fences, and pools. Open space uses are
limited to noncommercial parks, conservation and recreation
areas, and commercial agriculture and forestry. The following uses
shall not be permitted: day-care facilities, accessory apartments
and kennels. [Amended by the 2000 Town Meeting]
(3) Authority. In order to allow OSPD under the powers granted under
RSA 674:21, the Planning Board may waive the restrictions in
§ 490-202 (except maximum height) and § 490-804 in the
Residential or Rural Districts for new subdivisions on lots of 15
acres or more, provided that the criteria in this section are met.
B. Purposes. The purposes of OSPD are to:
(1) Preserve undeveloped land in its existing natural state in order to
protect valuable land and water resources for conservation,
forestry, agriculture, aquifer recharge, watershed protection,
wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and scenic and historic values
beyond the extent provided by existing regulations.
(2) Encourage housing development alternatives which are
harmonious with natural features through more sensitive siting of
buildings and better overall site planning. [Amended by the 2003
Town Meeting]
(3) Preserve views of open fields, woodlands, and undeveloped land as
seen from existing streets and observation points. [Added by the
2003 Town Meeting]
(4) Enable economical and efficient street, utility, and public facility
installation, construction and maintenance and a more efficient
provision of municipal services.
(5) Encourage a range of housing development alternatives which add
recreational and aesthetic amenities to new neighborhoods.
C. Review and approval process.
(1) Evaluation and approval of an OSPD shall be by the Planning Board
in accordance with the purposes, standards and guidelines set
forth in this section and the Salem Subdivision Control Regulations.
(2) Preapplication meetings. Prior to the submission of any final plans,
applicants are encouraged to prepare conceptual plans under both
conventional and OSPD regulations, review these plans with the
Planning Director, then review the plans with the Planning Board at
a regularly scheduled meeting. The conceptual design process for
§ 490-704 SALEM CODE § 490-704
1:580
an OSPD should start with a delineation of the most valuable
natural resources and open space attributes of the site. Potential
house locations, lot lines, road alignments and drainage facilities
should then be configured so as to accomplish the protection and
preservation of these resources and attributes.
D. Density standards.
(1) Maximum permitted lots. The number of lots or homes must be
equal to or less than the number allowed under § 490-301C in the
Residential District or § 490-302C in the Rural District, except as
noted below. A conventional subdivision layout, in accordance with
the restrictions in § 490-301C, 490-302C and § 490-706, shall be
used to determine the total number of lots or homes allowed. Any
land area used in the calculation of allowed homes or lots in an
approved OSPD shall not thereafter be eligible as contributing land
area in any subsequent development proposal. [Amended by the
2003 Town Meeting]
(2) Unbuildable lots. For the purposes of determining the number of
lots allowable under this section, there shall be excluded from the
number of lots shown on such conventional subdivision layout all
lots which the Planning Board finds are not reasonably buildable,
whether by reason of excessive development or site preparation
costs due to remote proposed location; poorly drained soils or steep
slopes; sanitary disposal, drainage or water supply requirements;
limited or unusually configured buildable area; the permitting
requirements of the state or other Town boards; or a combination
of the above. In consideration of the foregoing, the Planning Board
may consider recommendations of the Town Engineer,
Conservation Commission, Planning Director, or any appropriate
state agencies.
(3) Incentive provision. To encourage the preservation of open space
within the remaining large undeveloped parcels in the community,
the Planning Board may, at its discretion, award a density bonus
not to exceed 20% of the conventional number of lots allowed in a
subdivision (rounded to the highest number after 0.6) if the
following criteria are met: [Amended by the 2003 Town
Meeting]
(a) Initial parcel size of 40 acres or greater; and
(b) The Planning Board determines that the location of open space
and house lots demonstrates conformance with the purposes
and site design guidelines in Subsections B and G of this
section.
E. Open space standards.
(1) General. All land not utilized for road rights-of-way or building lots
shall be dedicated as permanently preserved open space.
§ 490-704 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-704
1:581
(2) Minimum required open space. At least 50% of the site must be
reserved in perpetuity as common open space. Of the minimum
open space required, at least 50% must consist of nonwetland soils
and soils with slopes less than 25%. Open space dedicated in
excess of the minimum required area may contain any percentage
of wetland soils or steep slopes. Open water may not be used to
meet more than 25% of the open space requirement. [Amended by
the 2003 Town Meeting]
(3) Protection, ownership and management. All common open space
shall be permanently protected by covenants and restrictions in
perpetuity, approved by the Conservation Commission, and:
(a) Shall be conveyed by the applicant to:
[1] A homeowners' association or other legal entity under
New Hampshire state statutes, or similar legal
arrangement, subject to review and approval by the Town
Attorney; or [Amended by the 2003 Town Meeting]
[2] A nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is
the conservation of open space; or
(b) Subject to approval of the Planning Board and Board of
Selectmen, may be dedicated to the Town of Salem with a trust
clause ensuring that it be maintained as open space.
(4) The Board may allow open space in excess of the minimum
requirements to be unrestricted by a conservation easement,
provided that use of the open space is limited by deed covenant to
noncommercial parks, conservation and recreation areas or
commercial agriculture and forestry. The Planning Board may
require further legal review of any documents submitted, the cost
of which shall be borne by the applicant.
F. Dimensional standards for building lots.
(1) Zoning dimensions.
(a) Lot shape and size. House lots and building envelopes should
generally be square or rectangular in shape and contain
sufficient area to accommodate average-sized houses and
typical amenities such as garages, pools and sheds. The
minimum lot size shall be no less than 15,000 square feet if
serviced by municipal sewer and 25,000 square feet if serviced
by on-site septic systems.
(b) Frontage. The minimum lot frontage shall be 100 feet.
Individual lot frontages may be further reduced to 75 feet
when fronting on curved streets, or when the Planning Board
determines that the purposes and standards of this section are
better met, provided that in no case shall there be less than
§ 490-704 SALEM CODE § 490-704
1:582
100 feet of lot width at the building line. [Amended by the
2003 Town Meeting]
(c) Setbacks (yards). For all dwelling units, the minimum front
yard setback shall be 30 feet, the minimum side yard setback
shall be 15 feet, and the minimum rear yard setback shall be 30
feet. Garages, sheds and pools must meet the setbacks in the
underlying district. [Amended by the 2000 and 2003 Town
Meetings]
(2) The Planning Board may vary these dimensional standards in
limited respects, provided that the intent and purposes of this
section are met.
G. Site design guidelines. The layout and configuration of lots, homes,
streets, building setbacks and open space are subject to the approval of
the Planning Board. The layout must demonstrate preservation of open
land in furtherance of the stated purposes of this section, without
detracting from the character of the neighborhood and without
seriously diminishing the value of surrounding property. Toward that
end, the Planning Board shall evaluate each proposal for an OSPD using
the following design guidelines, modified as appropriate to each
individual development site:
(1) Development location. Residences should be grouped in locations
so that scenic views and vistas will remain unblocked, particularly
as seen from public roads; prime agricultural soils, wildlife habitat
and shoreline areas will be protected; stone walls, historic sites and
their environs will be preserved; and significant natural features,
such as, but not limited to, vernal pools, prime aquifers, oldergrowth
trees, unique geologic formations and ridgelines, will be
protected. Wherever possible, structures should be located within
any wooded upland on the parcel, or along the far edges of open
fields and so that silhouettes of structures will be below the
ridgeline or hilltop or, if the site is wooded, the building silhouettes
will be lower than the existing canopy height. New dwellings and
structures should be screened from view from public roads with a
buffer of existing trees or new plantings. [Added by the 2003
Town Meeting]
(2) Open space layout. Open space should include the most sensitive
resource areas of the property and should be designed in larger
blocks of land, preferably as part of an integrated open space
network, laid out to be contiguous with open space areas of similar
character (whether permanently preserved or not) on adjacent
parcels. Contiguous open space should generally be more than
three acres in area and should have a length-to-width ratio of no
greater than four to one, except where intended to buffer linear
features such as watercourses and wetlands, or designed as trail
links. Fragmentation, or the creation of long, thin strips of open
space, should be avoided. Where open space directly adjoins
§ 490-704 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-704
1:583
§ 490-705. Floodplain development.
private lots, it shall be demarcated with logical, straightforward
boundaries such as existing stone walls, boulders, tree lines,
topographic breaks, a roadway or path, or post-and-rail fencing,
small signs or monuments. [Amended by the 2003 Town
Meeting]
(3) Pedestrian access/circulation. Open space should be laid out in
conjunction with existing and proposed streets, sidewalks and lots
so that the greatest degree of internal pedestrian circulation and
access from the lots to both on-site and off-site open space is
achieved. Access to the open space must be clear and direct and
arranged in a manner that does not conflict with the actual or
apparent use of private lots.
(4) Landscaping. Common areas (such as community greens, cul-desac
islands, and along both sides of new streets) should be
landscaped with deciduous shade trees and flowering shrubs. The
suggested minimum caliper is two inches and street tree interval is
50 feet but may vary according to species selected and site-specific
factors, at the discretion of the Planning Board.
A. Adoption of flood-related maps. The Flood Insurance Rate Maps
referred to in Subsection D as prepared for the Town of Salem by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency are hereby adopted, and such
maps shall be a part of this chapter and the Salem Building Codes.
[Amended by the 2009 Town Meeting]
B. Developments or encroachments in floodway prohibited. Any
development or encroachment, including fill, is prohibited in the
floodway, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps referred to in
Subsection A, which would result in the increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge. [Amended by the 2009 Town Meeting]
C. Restrictions on mobile homes in the floodway. No mobile home shall be
placed in the floodway as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps
referred to in Subsection A, unless the area is zoned for mobile homes
and there is an existing mobile home park at such location at the time of
the adoption of this section. [Amended by the 2009 Town Meeting]
D. Regulations for floodplain development. The following regulations shall
apply to all lands designated as special flood hazard areas by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance
Study for Rockingham County, New Hampshire, dated May 17, 2005, or
as amended, together with the associated Flood Insurance Rate Map
Panels numbered 0543, 0545, 0551, 0552, 0553, 0554, 0558, 0561,
0562, 0563, 0564, 0570, 0657, 0676, 0677, and 0681, dated May 17,
2005, or as amended, which are declared to be part of this section and
are hereby incorporated by reference. [Added by the 1989 Town
Meeting; amended by the 1998, 2002 and 2005 Town Meetings]
§ 490-704 SALEM CODE § 490-705
1:584
(1) Definitions. See § 490-107.
(2) The construction or placement of new buildings and structures in
any special flood hazard area is prohibited. Other proposed
development such as additions to existing buildings or replacement
of existing buildings in any special flood hazard areas shall require
a permit. In addition to the Town building permit application form,
applicants shall also complete a supplemental building permit
application ("floodplain building permit application") for proposed
construction in the special flood hazard area. [Amended by the
2007 Town Meetings]
(3) The Town of Salem shall review all building permit applications for
new construction or substantial improvements to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding. If a proposed building site is in a special flood hazard
area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall:
(a) Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including
the effects of buoyancy;
(b) Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
(c) Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages; and
(d) Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that
are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding. [Amended by the 2009 Town
Meeting]
(4) Where new and replacement water and sewer systems (including
on-site systems) are proposed in a special flood hazard area, the
applicant shall provide the Town of Salem with assurance that new
and replacement sanitary sewage systems will be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, and on-site
waste disposal systems will be located to avoid impairment to them
or contamination from them during periods of flooding. [Amended
by the 2009 Town Meeting]
(5) The Town of Salem shall maintain for public inspection, and furnish
upon request, any certification of floodproofing and the as-built
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved
structures, and include whether or not such structures contain a
basement. If the structure has been floodproofed, the as-built
§ 490-705 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-705
1:585
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was
floodproofed. This information must be furnished by the applicant.
(6) The Town of Salem shall review proposed developments to assure
that all necessary permits have been received from those
governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal
or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to certify these assurances to the
Town of Salem.
(7) Riverine situations.
(a) Prior to the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, the
applicant for such authorization shall notify the Wetlands
Bureau of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental
Services and submit copies of such notification to the Town of
Salem, in addition to the copies required by RSA 482-A:3.
Further, the applicant shall be required to submit copies of said
notification to those adjacent communities as determined by
the Building Inspector, including notice of all scheduled
hearings before the Wetlands Bureau.
(b) Within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse, the
applicant shall submit to the Town of Salem certification
provided by a registered professional engineer assuring that
the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse has been
maintained.
(c) Along watercourses that have a designated regulatory
floodway, no encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development, are allowed
within the designated regulatory floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the base
flood discharge.
(d) In Zone A the Town of Salem shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source as criteria for requiring that
development meet the following floodway requirement: "No
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, are allowed within the
designated regulatory floodway that would result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the base
flood discharge." [Amended by the 2009 Town Meeting]
(e) Along watercourses that have not had a regulatory floodway
designated, no new construction, substantial improvements or
§ 490-705 SALEM CODE § 490-705
1:586
other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zone AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development,
will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
[Amended by the 2009 Town Meeting]
(8) Special flood hazard areas.
(a) In special flood hazard areas the Town of Salem shall

§ 490-705 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-705
1:589
§ 490-706. Wetlands conservation. [Added by the 1987 Town
Meeting; amended by the 1989, 1996, 1997, 2006, 2007, 2012 and
2013 Town Meetings]
[2] That if the requested variance is for activity within a
designated regulatory floodway, no increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge will result; and
[3] That the variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(c) The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall notify the applicant in
writing that:
[1] The issuance of a variance to construct below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage; and
[2] Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions.
(d) The community shall:
[1] Maintain a record of all variance actions, including the
justification for their issuance; and
[2] Report such variances issued in its annual or biennial

(11) Certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy may be issued
for a building or structure that is within the purview of the
regulations contained in this Subsection D until the Building
Inspector certifies that all site and building improvements as
contained in the building permit application, plans and associated
documents have been completed; provided, however, that an
applicant may request that the Town accept a suitable and
sufficient performance bond or letter of credit, in a form suitable to
Town Counsel, to assure the completion of certain site or building
improvements that, due to factors beyond the control of the
applicant, have not been completed. [Added by the 2002 Town
Meeting]
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to protect the public
health, safety, and general welfare, by controlling and guiding the use
of land areas which have been found to be wetlands. This section is
adopted pursuant to the authority granted by New Hampshire RSA
674:16 and 674:17 and RSA 674:20 and 674:21. It is intended that this
section shall:
§ 490-705 SALEM CODE § 490-706
1:590
(1) Protect residents against the dangers of increased flooding by
preventing the destruction of, or significant changes to, natural
wetlands that provide flood protection.
(2) Protect potential water supplies and existing aquifers and aquifer
recharge areas.
(3) Prevent the pollution of surface water and groundwater.
(4) Prevent the destruction of, or significant changes to, natural
wetlands which provide filtration of water flowing into water bodies
or are connected to the ground- or surface water supply.
(5) Prevent unnecessary or excessive expense to the Town in providing
or maintaining essential services and utilities which might be
required as a result of misuse or abuse of wetlands and adjacent
upland areas.
(6) Lessen damage to structures and properties caused by
inappropriate development adjacent to or in wetlands.
(7) Protect wildlife habitats, maintain ecological balances, and
enhance ecological values.
(8) Maintain the integrity of wetlands by protecting adjacent vegetated
upland areas.
(9) Protect unique and unusual natural areas, including rare or
endangered species of flora and fauna.
(10) Promote conservation corridors along all major rivers, streams,
and drainage waterways.
(11) Encourage those low-intensity uses that can be harmoniously,
appropriately, and safely located in or adjacent to wetlands.
B. Definitions. See § 490-107.
C. Wetland delineation and limits.
(1) This section applies to wetlands as defined in § 490-107 and RSA
482-A:2, X. Wetlands include, but are not limited to, swamps,
marshes, bogs, vernal pools, and other similar areas. Wetlands
shall be identified and mapped by a certified wetland scientist.
(a) Wetlands shall be delineated on the basis of hydrophytic
vegetation, hydric soils, and wetlands hydrology in accordance
with the techniques outlined in the Corps of Engineers
Wetlands Delineation Manual, the Regional Supplement to the
Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: North
Central and Northeast Region (current version), and the Field
Indicators for Identifying Hydric Soils in New England (current
version), published by New England Interstate Water Pollution
Control Commission.
§ 490-706 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-706

(b) Prime wetlands shall be delineated using the current NH
Method in accordance with the New Hampshire Department of
Environmental Services (NHDES) Wetland Delineation
Standards: The Method for Inventorying and Evaluating
Freshwater Wetlands in New Hampshire. Town of Salem
mapped prime wetlands can be reviewed at the Salem Planning
Office.
(c) Vernal pools shall be delineated in accordance with the New
Hampshire Fish and Game Department's Identification and
Documentation of Vernal Pools in New Hampshire (current
version).
(2) Limits of wetlands covered under this section are:
(a) Wetland areas 1/2 acre or more in size;
(b) Wetland areas of any size if contiguous to or containing surface
waters (such as lakes, ponds, and streams) or very poorly
drained soils as defined by the Corps of Engineers Wetland
Delineation Manual and any current regional supplemental
manuals; and
(c) Vernal pools over 500 square feet in size.
(3) The following types of wetland areas are not subject to jurisdiction
of this section:
(a) A constructed vegetated swale, roadside ditch, or driveway
ditch.
(b) A sedimentation, detention, or retention basin.

D. Wetlands incorrectly delineated. In the event that an area has been
incorrectly delineated as a wetland, or that an area not so designated
was subsequently found to meet the criteria for a wetlands designation,
the Planning Board shall determine whether the regulations contained
herein have application.
(1) When it is believed that an area has been incorrectly delineated a
wetland, the applicant may present to the Planning Board the
findings of an independent certified wetland scientist approved by
the Planning Board or its agent. The Planning Board shall make its
judgment based upon the determination of the independent
certified wetland scientist. The applicant shall bear the costs of the
certified wetland scientist. Prime wetland redelineation will be
done using the method in Subsection C(1)(b), not the method
originally used to map the wetland.
(2) Where an area is not delineated as a wetland and the Planning
Board or its agent reasonably believes it to be a wetland, the
§ 490-706 SALEM CODE § 490-706
1:592
Planning Board may require the applicant to supply the findings
of an independent certified wetland scientist as defined in RSA
310-A:76, II-a, as approved by the Board or its agent. The Planning
Board shall make its judgment based upon the determination of
the independent certified wetland scientist. The applicant is
responsible for bearing the costs of the certified wetland scientist.
E. Buffers and setbacks.
(1) An undisturbed natural buffer area of at least 20 feet in width shall
be maintained around the entire edge of any wetland defined in
§ 490-107. Access through the buffer zone shall be granted to allow
activities in furtherance of those wetland uses permitted under
Subsection G. Fallen, dead, diseased, unsafe or New Hampshire
identified invasive trees and vegetation may be removed.
(2) An undisturbed natural buffer area of at least 100 feet in width
shall be maintained between any designated prime wetland, as
defined in RSA 482-A:15 and adopted by Town Meeting, and any
new development, including but not limited to structures,
dwellings, septic systems, and roads.
(3) No building or surface structure shall be constructed within 40 feet
of a wetland area.
(4) All paved surfaces shall be set back 40 feet from any wetland.
Paved surfaces shall include but not be limited to parking lots, fire
lanes, and roads.
(5) The minimum setback between septic systems and wetlands shall
meet New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services
requirements. [Amended by the 2016 Town Meeting]
F. Restrictions
(1) Where water and other effluents leave a man-made drainage
system, adequate measures, including but not limited to buffer
zones and natural treatment swales (such as rain gardens), shall be
provided to protect the wetland from pollution, erosion, or siltation.
Treatment systems shall be designed according to NHDES and
federal regulations.
(2) Adequate erosion control, including but not limited to hay bales,
silt fences, and riprap, shall be maintained before, during, and after
construction to protect undisturbed wetland areas from intrusion
and siltation. After site stabilization, temporary erosion controls
shall be removed.

to 25% of the minimum lot size required by the underlying
zoning district.
(b) Areas designated as very poorly drained or freshwater marsh
may not be used to fulfill any portion of the minimum lot size
required by the underlying zoning district.
G. Permitted and prohibited uses.
(1) Prohibited uses within wetlands are those that require the erection
or construction of any structure or building, will alter the natural
surface configuration by the addition of fill or by dredging, and that
otherwise are not permitted by this chapter.
(2) Permitted uses within wetlands include the following or similar
uses:
(a) Forestry according to recognized tree harvest practices and
tree farming;
(b) Cultivation and harvesting of crops according to recognized
soil conservation practices;
(c) Wildlife refuge;
(d) Parks and recreation uses that are primary uses of the property
and that are consistent with the purpose and intent of this
section; and

H. Exemptions.
(1) RSA 674:39 applies.
(2) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the construction
of additions and extensions to one- and two-family dwellings shall
be permitted within the areas controlled by this section, provided
that:
(a) The dwelling lawfully existed prior to the effective date of this
section;
(b) The proposed construction conforms to all other applicable
ordinances and regulations of the Town of Salem; and
(c) The dwelling continues in its present use.
(3) Wetland buffer. Exempt from this requirement are the construction
of additions and extensions to buildings which existed prior to the
effective date of this section (March 1987) or the development or
redevelopment of a lot where the buffer does not already exist as of
the effective date of this section.
§ 490-706 SALEM CODE § 490-706
1:594
(4) Prime wetland buffer. Exempt from this requirement are those uses
permitted under Subsection G(2), those lots separated from a
prime wetland by an existing public road, and the construction of
additions and extensions to buildings which existed prior to the
effective date of this section. Nothing herein is intended to prohibit
the development or redevelopment of any portion of a lot which has
already been improved, or developed and regularly maintained, as
of the effective date of this section.
(5) Setback. For all wetlands, residential driveways are exempt from
this regulation. Also exempt is access to a property, not including
parking spaces, and road crossings approved under the Subsection
I(1) conditional use permit criteria.
I. Conditional use permit.
(1) The Planning Board may grant a conditional use permit to modify
the requirements of Subsections E, F and G, in limited respects,
provided the Board finds that all of the following criteria are met:
(a) The modification complies with the purposes and intent of this
section noted in Subsection A.
(b) There is no feasible alternative to the modification with less
impact to the wetland or buffer.
(c) The detrimental impact to wetlands and buffers is minimized.
(d) There will be no adverse impact on neighboring properties.
(e) The applicant provides the Planning Board and Conservation
Commission findings of a certified wetland scientist approved
by the Planning Board or its agent at the applicant's expense.
(f) The applicant provides the Planning Board and Conservation
Commission with a wetland mitigation plan which meets the
following: a minimum gain of two square feet of on-site
wetland replication for each square foot of wetland lost, except
for prime wetlands where a gain of five square feet of on-site
wetland replication shall be provided for each square foot of
wetland lost. In the case of streets, roads, accessways, and
utility crossings, such mitigation shall only be required if 3,000
square feet or more of wetland is impacted. The wetland
replication plan must be prepared by a certified wetland
scientist and detail the construction methodology, planting
plan and monitoring protocol. For impacts to wetland setbacks
and buffers, mitigation measures shall be incorporated to
minimize wetland degradation such as, but not limited to,
buffer plantings, removal of existing pavement, and increased
buffers elsewhere on the site.

Meeting; amended by the 2005 Town Meeting]
(g) A recommendation from the Conservation Commission is
submitted. [Amended by the 2017 Town Meeting]
(h) The applicant has received all necessary state and federal
permits prior to the issuance of the conditional use permit.
(2) An applicant is not entitled to a conditional use permit, and the
Planning Board may, in its discretion, decline to grant it if the
Board determines such a permit is not justified or warranted in
accordance with the above criteria. Economic considerations alone
are not sufficient reason for granting a conditional use permit.
(3) This provision is adopted as an innovative land use control
pursuant to RSA 674:21 and the Planning Board is vested with sole
authority to administer it and to grant the conditional use permits.
J. Special provisions.
(1) The Town of Salem, as a governmental body, shall not be exempt
from this section nor the rules and regulations found therein.
(2) Any property containing wetlands on which a conservation
easement has been obtained shall be maintained in perpetuity as
open space. Activities conducted thereon shall be limited to those
specifically allowed for in Subsection G. Conservation easement
boundaries shall be marked by the easement grantor with granite
monuments or by other durable means approved by the Planning
Board.
(3) Granting variances to this section shall be considered contrary to
its spirit and intent.
A. Purpose and intent. This section is enacted to permit the siting of
personal wireless service facilities (hereinafter PWSF) in the Town of
Salem consistent with the power granted to municipalities under
federal and New Hampshire law. [47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7); RSA 12-K:1 et
seq. and RSA 674:16 et seq.] The Town of Salem, in siting wireless
facilities, shall act consistent with the following:
(1) Avoid and mitigate adverse impacts such facilities may create,
including but not limited to the following impacts: visual,
environmental, historical, flight corridors, health, safety and
prosperity.
(2) Promote co-location for facilities when such co-location minimizes
the adverse impacts described in Subsection A above through an
assessment of technology, current location options, future available
locations, innovative siting techniques, and siting possibilities
beyond the political jurisdiction of the Town.
§ 490-706 SALEM CODE § 490-707
1:596
(3) Permit the siting of facilities on new ground-mounted structures
only where all other reasonable siting opportunities have been
exhausted and encourage the siting of facilities, whether on new
structures or existing, in a way that minimizes the adverse impacts
of the facilities.
(4) Create a hierarchy of preferred locations to further the Town's
planning goals by legislatively declaring siting preferences
favoring siting first on Town-owned sites located in industrially or
commercially zoned sites and public rights-of-way and Towncontrolled
structures throughout the Town, by building permit only;
second, on industrially zoned sites; third, commercially zoned sites;
and rural or residentially zoned sites last, as well as preferring
lower or stealth towers where possible, including sensitivity to
historic locations and environmentally sensitive areas, and
aesthetic and planning concerns.
(5) Require that facilities be constructed and maintained safely.
(6) Provide for the removal of abandoned facilities, including a
mechanism for the Town to remove these abandoned facilities at
the facility owner's expense to protect the citizens from imminent
harm and danger.
B. Definitions. See § 490-107.
C. Siting standards.
(1) General.
(a) Siting priority. An applicant seeking approval for a PWSF shall
comply with the following:
[1] Preference will be given to the siting of PWSF on existing
PWSF, including preexisting towers and antennas, where
such co-location can exist while preserving the character
and integrity of the existing structure and without other
adverse impacts.
[2] To the extent that there are no existing PWSF which meet
the requirements of the applicant, preference will be given
to locating facilities on Town-owned land in industrial or
commercial districts or within the public rights-of-way
throughout the Town or on Town-owned or -controlled
structures throughout the Town.
[3] To the extent existing facilities or Town-owned property or
structures under Subsection C(1)(a)[1] and [2] above are
not available, preference will be given to locating facilities
on existing structures of other kinds, such as a water
tower or church steeple, where such co-location preserves
§ 490-707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-707
1:597
the character and integrity of the existing structure and
does not create other adverse impacts.
[4] To the extent that siting locations under Subsection
C(1)(a)[1], [2] and [3] above are not available, preference
will be given to siting a facility within the Industrial
District.
[5] To the extent that siting locations under Subsection
C(1)(a)[1], [2], [3] and [4] above are not available,
preference will be given to siting a facility within the
Commercial District.
[6] To the extent that siting locations under C(1)(a)[1], [2], [3],
[4] and [5] above are not available, then the siting of the
PWSF shall be governed by a conditional use permit under
this section (Subsection E).
(b) Burden of proof on applicant regarding siting priority.
[1] The burden of proof that there are no existing structures
upon which an applicant may locate its PWSF and/or
transmit or receive radio signals shall include, at a
minimum:
[a] The applicant shall submit a list of all owner contacts,
including the Town, made with regard to the
availability of a site for a potential PWSF. If the
Planning Board or Town staff find additional existing
buildings and structures that may be satisfactory, the
applicant shall contact the property owners.
[b] The applicant shall provide copies of all letters of
inquiry made to owners of existing structures and
letters of rejection. If letters of rejection are not
provided, at a minimum, unanswered "return receipt
requested" forms from the U.S. Post Office shall be
provided for each owner of existing structures that
was contacted.
[c] If an applicant claims that a structure is not
structurally capable of supporting a PWSF, this claim
must be certified by a registered professional
engineer licensed in the State of New Hampshire. The
certification shall, at a minimum, explain the
structural issues and demonstrate that the structure
cannot be modified to support the PWSF at a
reasonable cost.
[2] The burden of proof that no locations in areas of the Town
identified herein as preferred siting locations to the
location proposed by the applicant are suitable for the
§ 490-707 SALEM CODE § 490-707
1:598
applicant's needs shall include, at a minimum, maps
certified by a radio frequency engineer licensed in the
State of New Hampshire showing:
[a] Coverage gaps of existing PWSF in or near Salem; and
[b] Coverage of PWSF if built on the available preferred
siting locations.
(2) Use regulations. A PWSF shall require a building permit in all cases
and may be permitted as follows:
(a) Existing personal wireless service structures. A PWSF may
locate, subject to the issuance of a building permit that
includes review of the application required by this section by
the Planning Director, on any existing personal wireless
service structure, including any guyed tower, lattice tower,
mast tower, stealth tower or monopole tower in existence prior
to the adoption of this section, so long as co-location complies
with any approved site plan. All the requirements stated in this
section at Subsection D shall be met. This provision shall apply
only so long as the height of the existing tower structure is not
increased, a security barrier already exists, and the area of the
security barrier is not increased.
(b) Town-owned or -controlled land and structures. A PWSF may
locate, subject to the issuance of a building permit that
includes review of the application required by this section by
the Planning Director, on any Town-owned land in any
Industrial or Commercial District, so long as the facility
complies with the requirements stated in this section at
Subsection D, the facility does not exceed the height
limitations in this section, and the PWSF includes a security
barrier. In addition, antennas may be located on existing
telecommunications poles or replacement poles located on
Town-owned land or in the public right-of-way throughout the
Town, subject to applicable federal and state law. In addition,
antennas may be located on existing Town-owned or -
controlled structures located throughout the Town, including
but not limited to municipal communications facilities, athletic
field lights, traffic lights, streetlights and/or other types of
utility poles. All other sitings shall require site plan review and
approval by the Planning Board.
(c) Existing structures. A PWSF may locate, subject to the
provisions of this section and site plan review, on an existing
structure other than on an existing personal wireless service or
tower structure.
(d) Industrial or Commercial District. A PWSF may locate within
the Industrial or Commercial District, subject to the provisions
of this section and subject to site plan review.
§ 490-707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-707
1:599
(e) Conditional use permit. A PWSF may locate in any other area
of the Town, subject to a conditional use permit granted by the
Planning Board and subject to site plan review by the Planning
Board. The elements of the conditional use permit are
described at Subsection E below.
D. General application requirements.
(1) General. Unless otherwise provided, all applicants under this
section shall apply to the Planning Board for site plan review and
comply with the requirements as provided herein in this
subsection, and as provided for in the Site Plan Review

§ 490-707 SALEM CODE § 490-707
1:600
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) further referenced
in applicable FCC rules. If an environmental assessment (EA)
or an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required under
the FCC rules and NEPA, submission of the EA or EIS to the
Board prior to the beginning of the federal thirty-day comment
period, and the Town process, shall become part of the
application requirements.
(2) General PWSF requirements. The requirements and limitations in
this section shall preempt all other requirements and limitations as
required by this chapter and shall apply only to PWSF.
(a) Height.
[1] Existing structures. New PWSF located on any of the
following existing structures shall be exempt from the
height restrictions of this chapter, provided that there is
no more than a twenty-foot increase in the height of the
existing structure as a result of the installation of a PWSF:
water towers, electric transmission and distribution
towers, utility poles, and similar existing utility structures,
guyed towers, lattice towers, monopoles, flagpoles,
steeples or chimneys; and
[2] Height for ground-mounted facilities. Ground-mounted
PWSF located in the Industrial District shall not exceed
150 feet in height. Ground-mounted PWSF located in the
Commercial District shall not exceed 120 feet in height. In
addition, ground-mounted PWSF located throughout the
Town may project 20 feet above the average surrounding
tree canopy height.
(b) Setbacks. All PWSF and equipment shelters shall comply with
building setback provisions of the zoning district in which the
facility is located, except that no PWSF and equipment shelter
shall be located within 200 feet of any existing residence.
(c) Fall zone. In order to ensure public safety, the minimum
distance from the ground mount of a PWSF to any property
line, road, habitable dwelling, business or institutional use or
public recreational area shall be 100% of the height of the
facility, including any antennas or other appurtenances. This
setback is considered the "fall zone." The Planning Board may
reduce the fall zone upon a showing that the technical quality
and nature of the facility do not require as large a fall zone as is
otherwise required by this section. In the event that an existing
structure is proposed as a mount for a PWSF, a fall zone shall
not be required, but the setback provisions of the zoning
district shall apply. In the case of preexisting nonconforming
structures, PWSF and equipment shelters shall not increase
any nonconformities except as provided herein.
§ 490-707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-707
1:601
(d) Performance standards.
[1] Visual impact and lighting. Visual impacts are measured
on the basis of change in community scale, as exhibited in
relative height, mass or proportion of the PWSF within its
proposed surroundings; new visible elements proposed on
a contrasting background; different colors and textures
proposed against a contrasting background; and use of
materials that are foreign to the existing built
environment.
[a] Enhancements. Preservation of the existing developed
and natural environments within Salem is an
enhancement to the Town. Enhancements are
measured on the basis of conservation of
opportunities to maintain community scale; amount
and type of landscaping and/or natural vegetation;
preservation of view corridors, vistas and viewsheds;
and continuation of existing colors, textures and
materials.
[b] Visibility focuses on eliminating or mitigating the
visual impact and maximizing enhancement of the
existing environment.
[c] Location. The requirements in this subsection shall
govern the location of all facilities and the installation
of all antennas. The requirements are as follows:
[i] Towers shall be located on sites where the grade/
slope and tree cover of the site and surrounding
land can be used to decrease any adverse visual
impacts;
[ii] Towers or ground mounts shall either maintain a
galvanized steel finish, subject to any applicable
standards of the FAA, or be painted a neutral
color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness;
[iii] The design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the maximum extent possible, use
materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend the tower facilities
with the natural setting and built environment.
These buildings and facilities shall also be subject
to all other site plan review regulation
requirements;
[iv] If an antenna is installed on a structure other than
a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical
and mechanical equipment must be of neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible
§ 490-707 SALEM CODE § 490-707
1:602
with, the color of the supporting structure so as
to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible;
[v] Facilities shall not be artificially lighted, unless
required by the FAA or other applicable authority.
If lighting is required, the Planning Board may
review the available lighting alternatives and
approve the design that would cause the least
disturbance to the surrounding views; and
[vi] Facilities shall not contain any permanent or
temporary signs, writing, symbols, or any graphic
representation of any kind.
[2] Federal requirements. All facilities must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC, and
any other agency of the federal government with the
authority to regulate facilities and antennas. If such
standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of
the facilities governed by this section shall bring such
facilities into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations within six months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a more stringent
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling
federal agency. Failure to bring facilities into compliance
with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal, in accordance with
Subsection G(2), of the facilities at the owner's expense
through the execution of the posted security required by
Subsection G(1).
[3] Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural
integrity of facilities and antennas, the owner of a facility
shall certify that it is constructed and maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable local
building codes and the applicable standards for PWSF that
are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as
amended from time to time. The owner of the facility shall
initially provide proof of structural integrity by report of a
structural engineer licensed in New Hampshire and
thereafter shall provide certifying reports to the Town
every five years. All facilities shall be designed and
operated in a manner that minimizes the risk of igniting a
fire or intensifying one that otherwise occurs. If, upon
inspection, the Town concludes that a facility fails to
comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a
danger to persons or property, then upon notice being
provided to the owner of the facility, the owner shall have
30 days to bring such facility into compliance with such
standards. If the owner fails to bring such facility into
§ 490-707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-707
1:603
compliance within 30 days, such action shall constitute
grounds for the removal, in accordance with Subsection
G(2), of the facility at the owner's expense through
execution of the posted security required by Subsection
G(1).
[4] Additional requirements. These requirements shall
supersede any and all other applicable standards found
elsewhere in Salem ordinances or regulations that are less
strict:
[a] Landscaping.
[i] Towers or ground-mounted facilities shall be
landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that
effectively screens the view of the equipment
shelter from adjacent residential property and
public roads. The standard buffer shall consist of
a landscaped strip at least 10 feet wide outside
the perimeter of the tower compound. Natural
vegetation is preferred;
[ii] In locations where the visual impact of the tower
would be minimal, the landscaping requirement
may be reduced or waived entirely; and
[iii] Existing mature tree growth and natural land
forms on the site shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large wooded lots, natural growth
around the property may be deemed a sufficient
buffer.
E. Conditional use permits.
(1) General. All applicants under this section for conditional use
permits shall be required to apply to the Planning Board for site
plan review, to comply with the requirements provided herein in
Subsection D, to comply with the Site Plan Review Regulations, and
to submit the information required below in Subsection E(2).
(2) Issuance of conditional use permits. In granting the conditional use
permit, the Planning Board may impose conditions to the extent the
Board concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any
adverse effect of the proposed siting on adjoining properties and to
preserve the intent of this section.
(a) Procedure on application. The Planning Board shall act upon
the application in accordance with the procedural
requirements of the Site Plan Review Regulations and RSA
676:4.
§ 490-707 SALEM CODE § 490-707
1:604
(b) Decisions. Possible decisions rendered by the Planning Board
include approval, approval with conditions, or denial. All
decisions shall be rendered in writing, and a denial shall be in
writing and based upon substantial evidence contained in the
written record.
(c) Elements of conditional permit. The applicant has the burden
of addressing the following:
[1] The height of the proposed tower or other structure is
necessary to provide personal wireless services;
[2] The effect of the proximity of the facility to residential
development or districts;
[3] Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
[4] Surrounding topography;
[5] Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
[6] Design of the facility, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
[7] Proposed ingress and egress to the site;
[8] Availability of suitable existing sites and other structures
as required herein in Subsection C(1)(b);
[9] Visual impacts on viewsheds, ridgelines, and other impacts
by means of cell site location, tree and foliage clearing and
placement of incidental structures; and
[10] Availability of alternative siting locations as required
herein in Subsection C(1)(b).
(3) Information required. Each applicant requesting a conditional use
permit under this section shall submit a scaled plan in accordance
with the Site Plan Review Regulations and further information,
including a scaled elevation view, topography, radio frequency
coverage, facility height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking,
fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses (up to 200 feet away), and any
other information deemed necessary by the Planning Board to
assess compliance with this section. Furthermore, the applicant
shall submit the following prior to any approval by the Board:
(a) Written proof that the proposed use/facility complies with the
FCC regulations on radio frequency (RF) exposure guidelines;
(b) Written proof that an evaluation has taken place, as well as the
results of such evaluation, satisfying the requirements of the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) further referenced
in applicable FCC rules. If an environmental assessment (EA)
§ 490-707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-707
1:605
or an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required under
the FCC rules and NEPA, submission of the EA or EIS to the
Board prior to the beginning of the federal thirty-day comment
period, and the Town process, shall become part of the
application requirements;
(c) An inventory of its preexisting facilities that are within the
jurisdiction of the Town and those within two miles of the
border thereof, including specific information about the
location, height, and design of each facility, as well as
economic and technological feasibility for co-location on the
inventoried facilities. The Planning Board may share such
information with other applicants applying for approvals or
conditional use permits under this section or other
organizations seeking to locate antennas within the
jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that
the Planning Board is not, by sharing such information, in any
way representing or warranting that such sites are available or
suitable.
(d) If the applicant is proposing to build a new tower or other
ground-mounted structure, the applicant shall submit written
evidence demonstrating that no existing structure can
accommodate the applicant's proposed facility. This evidence
can consist of:
[1] Substantial evidence that no existing towers or structures
are located within the geographic area required to meet
the applicant's engineering requirements, provided that a
description of the geographic area required is also
submitted;
[2] Substantial evidence that existing structures, including
towers, are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's
engineering requirements, and why;
[3] Substantial evidence that the existing towers or structures
do not have sufficient structural strength to support the
applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
[4] Substantial evidence that applicant's proposed antenna
would cause electromagnetic interference with the
antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna;
[5] Substantial evidence that the fees, costs, or contractual
provisions required by the owner in order to share the
existing tower or structure are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable; and
§ 490-707 SALEM CODE § 490-707
1:606
[6] Substantial evidence that the applicant can demonstrate
other limiting factors that render existing towers and
structures unsuitable.
(e) The applicant proposing to build a tower or ground-mounted
structure shall submit an agreement with the Town that allows
for the maximum allowance of co-location upon the new
structure to the extent such co-location can exist while
minimizing adverse impacts noted in Subsection A(1). Such
statement shall become a condition to any approval. This
statement shall, at a minimum, require the applicant to supply
available co-location for reasonable fees and costs to other
telecommunications providers. Failure to provide such an
agreement is evidence of the applicant's unwillingness to
cooperate with the orderly and well-planned development of
Salem and is grounds for a denial.
(f) The applicant shall submit the engineering information
detailing the size and coverage required for the PWSF location.
The Planning Board may have any submitted information
reviewed by a consultant for verification of any claims made by
the applicant regarding technological limitations and
feasibility for alternative locations, or any other matter
required by the application. Cost for this review shall be borne
by the applicant in accordance with RSA 676:4, I(g).
F. Waivers.
(1) General. Where the Board finds that extraordinary hardships,
practical difficulties, or unnecessary and unreasonable expense
would result from strict compliance with the terms of Subsections
D and E or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve waivers
to these regulations, including waivers of the height standard in
Subsection D(2)(a). The purpose of granting waivers under
provisions of these regulations shall be to ensure that an applicant
is not unduly burdened as opposed to merely inconvenienced by
said regulations. The Board shall not approve any waiver(s) unless
a majority of those present and voting shall find that all of the
following apply:
(a) The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property and will
promote the public interest.
(b) The waiver will not, in any manner, vary the provisions of this
chapter, the Salem Master Plan, or Official Maps.
(c) Such waiver(s) will substantially secure the objectives,
standards and requirements of these regulations.
§ 490-707 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-707
1:607
(d) A particular and identifiable hardship exists or a specific
circumstance warrants the granting of a waiver. Factors to be
considered in determining the existence of a hardship shall
include but not be limited to:
[1] Topography and other site features.
[2] Availability of alternative site locations.
[3] Geographic location of property.
[4] Size/magnitude of project being evaluated and availability
of co-location.
(2) Conditions. In approving waivers, the Board may impose such
conditions as it deems appropriate to substantially secure the
objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
(3) Procedures. A petition for any such waiver shall be submitted in
writing by the applicant with the application for Board review. The
petition shall state fully the grounds for the waiver and all of the
facts relied upon by the applicant. Failure to submit petition in
writing shall require an automatic denial.
G. Miscellaneous.
(1) Bonding, security and insurance. Recognizing the extremely
hazardous situation presented by inadequately maintained or
abandoned and unmonitored facilities, the Planning Board shall set
the form and amount of security that represents the cost for
removal and disposal of abandoned facilities in the event that the
PWSF is abandoned or inadequately maintained and the PWSF
owner is incapable and unwilling to remove or maintain it.
Furthermore, the Planning Board shall require the submission of
proof of adequate insurance covering accident or damage.
(2) Removal of abandoned antennas and facilities. Any antenna or
PWSF that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months
shall be considered abandoned and hazardous to the public health
and safety. The owner shall remove the abandoned PWSF within 90
days of receipt of a declaration of abandonment from the Town
notifying the owner of such abandonment. A declaration of
abandonment shall only be issued following a public hearing,
noticed per Town regulations, with notice to abutters and the last
known owner/operator of the facility. If the abandoned facility is not
removed within 90 days, the Town may execute the security and
have the facility removed. If there are two or more users of a single
facility, this provision shall not become effective until all users
cease using the facility.
(3) Enforcement. Enforcement of this section shall be in accordance
with RSA 676 and this chapter.

control of the antenna user where the user has a direct or
indirect ownership or leasehold interest in the property.
(b) The Code Enforcement Officer shall apply the standard set
forth in Subsection B(3)(a)[1] and [2] above in a
nondiscriminatory manner and impose no greater restrictions
on antennas covered by this rule than are imposed on the
installation, maintenance, or use of other modern
appurtenances, devices, or fixtures that are comparable in
size, weight, and appearance to these antennas. The
application of this subsection shall be no more burdensome to
affected antenna users than is necessary to achieve the
objectives described in Subsection B(3)(a)[1] and [2] of this
section.
(c) Any fee or cost imposed on a user by a rule, law, regulation or
restriction must be reasonable in light of the cost of the
equipment or services and the rule's, law's, regulation's or
restriction's treatment of comparable devices.
(4) Satellite dish antennas in commercial or industrial districts.
(a) Satellite dish antennas are not permitted in commercial or
industrial districts when the Code Enforcement Officer
determines that the siting of such a facility constitutes a
hazard to public health or safety, including but not limited to
fire or traffic.
(b) The application of this subsection shall be no more
burdensome to satellite users than is necessary to achieve the
health or safety objective.

shall not be permitted and a variance will be required to have that use.
§ 490-709 SALEM CODE § 490-710
1:612
(as defined in Subsection G hereof). The additions or expansions of existing
uses and facilities, including horse racing and/or gaming uses, on such lots
shall be subject to the provisions of Subsection F of this section.
A. In accordance with RSA 674:21, I(i), the intent of these provisions is to
promote flexibility in certain large-scale redevelopment of larger
parcels in the Commercial-Industrial C District based upon a
conceptual development plan which is consistent with the Town of
Salem Master Plan. The process allows flexibility for the redevelopment
project to be proposed largely independent from current land use
regulations, including the selection of land uses, density, setbacks,
buffers, building heights, lot sizes, lot dimensions, and parking
requirements otherwise applicable to the property.
B. The Planning Board may grant conditional use permits to vary the
restrictions in § 490-501B (permitted uses) and C (restrictions) and
§ 490-701 (off-street parking and loading), consistent with the criteria
noted below. An applicant is not entitled to a conditional use permit,
and the Planning Board may, in its discretion, decline to grant such
permit if the Board determines such permit is not justified or warranted
in accordance with the below criteria and the intent of this regulation.
This provision is adopted as an innovative land use control pursuant to
RSA 674:21, II, and the Planning Board is vested with sole authority to
administer it and to grant the conditional use permits. All other zoning
regulations shall apply.
C. As part of the site plan approval process for large-scale redevelopment
in the Commercial-Industrial C District, the applicant/owner shall be
required to prepare a conceptual development plan for the entire
parcel. The conceptual development plan shall show existing site
conditions and proposed development, including the general types,
locations and intensities of proposed land uses and proposed traffic and
pedestrian flows, and shall generally indicate how the proposed
development of the site will impact municipal services and facilities and
abutting properties.
D. Criteria.
(1) The conceptual development plan shall meet the following criteria
for redevelopment:
(a) Creating a well planned and integrated development with a
mixture of land uses, including residential, retail, office,
entertainment, hotels, restaurants, or other compatible land
uses.
(b) Mitigating negative impacts on traffic, public utilities,
municipal services, and natural resources.
(c) Limiting new access points on South and North Broadway.
§ 490-710 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-710
1:613
(d) Providing transitions between existing and proposed land uses
which protect residential abutters.

1:615
(1) The Planning Board is hereby authorized to assess impact fees for
public capital facilities, including and limited to:
(a) Public road systems and rights-of-way;
(b) Public school facilities;
(c) Public safety facilities; and
(d) Public recreation facilities, not including public open space.
(2) The Planning Board shall have the authority to adopt regulations to
implement the provisions of this section and to delegate the
administrative functions of impact fee assessment, collection and
disbursement.
(3) The use of the following documents, as amended, provides a
proportionate basis for the assessment of impact fees in Salem:
(a) (Reserved)181
(b) Public School Impact Fees: Basis of Assessment, Town of
Salem, 2004 update, as amended;
(c) Public Recreation Impact Fees: Basis of Assessment, Salem,
New Hampshire (2004), as amended;

[Added by the 2016 Town Meeting]
D. Standards and methodology for assessment.
(1) The amount of any impact fee shall be a proportional share of
public facility improvement costs which are reasonably related to
the capital needs created by the development, and to the benefits
accruing to the development from the capital improvements
financed by the fee.
(2) The Planning Board may prepare, adopt, or amend studies, reports,
or cost allocation procedures that are consistent with the above
standards and which define a basis for impact fee assessment for
public capital facilities and the impact fee assessment schedules
therefor.
181. Editor's Note: Former Subsection C(3)(a), regarding the Planning Boards Cost Allocation
Procedure for Roads, was repealed by the 2016 Town Meeting.
§ 490-711 SALEM CODE § 490-711
1:616
(3) No methodology, cost allocation procedure, or other basis of
assessment, nor related impact fee schedules, or changes in the
basis of assessment or the fee schedules, shall become effective
until it shall have been the subject of a public hearing before the
Planning Board.
(4) In the case of new development created by conversion or
modification of an existing use, the impact fee shall be based upon
the net increase in the impact fee calculated for the new use as
compared to the impact fee that was, or would have been, assessed
for the previous use.
(5) Upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructures, the need for
which is not created by new development, shall not be paid for by
impact fees.
E. Review and change in assessment schedules. The impact fee
assessment schedules shall be reviewed by the Planning Board in
conjunction with updates to the Master Plan, but no less frequently
than every five years, along with the foundation documents that provide
the basis for the assessment schedules. Such review may result in
recommended adjustments in one or more of the fees based on the most
recent data as they affect the variables in the fee calculations. Changes
in the impact fee assessment schedules shall be effective only where the
change in the basis of assessment or the fee schedule is adopted
following a public hearing on the proposed change.
F. Assessment and collection of impact fees.
(1) Where subdivision or site plan approval is required for new
development, impact fees shall be assessed at the time of Planning
Board approval of a subdivision plat or site plan.
(2) When no Planning Board approval is required, or has been made
prior to the adoption or amendment of this section, impact fees
shall be assessed prior to, or as a condition for, the issuance of a
building permit.
(3) Impact fees shall be collected at the time a certificate of occupancy
is issued. If no certificate of occupancy is required, impact fees
shall be collected at the time when the development is ready for its
intended use.
(4) The Planning Board and the fee payer may establish an alternate,
mutually acceptable schedule of payment of impact fees at the time
of subdivision or site plan approval by the Planning Board. If an
alternate schedule of payment is established, the Planning Board
may require the applicant to post security, in the form of a cash
bond, letter of credit, or performance bond, so as to guarantee
future payment of assessed impact fees.
§ 490-711 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-711
1:617
(5) No building permit for new development requiring payment of an
impact fee shall be issued until the amount of the impact fee
assessment has been determined by the Chief Building Official.
(6) No building permit shall be issued for new development until the
fee payer has established a mutually acceptable schedule for
payment of such fee with the Town of Salem. No certificate of
occupancy shall be issued for new development which is subject to
impact fee assessment until the fee is paid in full.
G. Waivers. The Planning Board may grant full or partial waivers of impact
fees where the Board finds that one or more of the following criteria are
met with respect to the particular public capital facilities for which
impact fees are normally assessed:
(1) A fee payer may request a full or partial waiver of public school and
recreation impact fees for those residential units that are lawfully
restricted to occupancy by senior citizens age 62 or over in a
development that is also maintained in compliance with the
provisions of RSA 354-A:15, Housing for Older Persons. The
Planning Board may waive school impact fee assessments on such
age-restricted units where it finds that the property will be bound
by lawful deeded restrictions on occupancy by senior citizens age
62 or over for a period of at least 20 years.
(2) A person undertaking the development of in-law apartments,
accessory apartments, or projects approved under the Seniors
Housing Overlay District may apply for a waiver of school impact
fees otherwise required by this section. Prior to granting such a
waiver for certain dwelling units in such a development, the
Planning Board shall find that, due to lawful, long-term occupancy
restrictions pertaining to such units, no significant school
enrollment impacts are anticipated as a result of the construction
of those units. Public safety, recreation, and road impact fees shall
still be required for such dwelling units. [Amended by the 2011
Town Meeting]
(3) The Planning Board may agree to waive all or part of an impact fee
assessment and accept, in lieu of a cash payment, a proposed
contribution of real property or facility improvements of equivalent
value and utility to the public. Prior to acting on a request for a
waiver of impact fees that would involve a contribution of real
property or the construction of capital facilities, the Planning Board
shall submit a copy of the waiver request to the Board of Selectmen
for its review and consent prior to its acceptance of the proposed
contribution. The value of contributions or improvements shall be
credited only toward facilities of like kind and may not be credited
to other categories of impact fee assessment. All costs incurred by
the Town for the review of such proposal, including consultant and
counsel fees, shall be paid by the fee payer.
§ 490-711 SALEM CODE § 490-711
1:618
H. Appeals under this section.
(1) If a fee payer elects to dispute the amount of the impact fee, the fee
payer may prepare and submit to the Planning Board an
independent fee calculation study for the new development activity
which is proposed. The Planning Board shall review such study and
render its decision. All costs incurred by the Town for the review of
such study shall be paid by the fee payer.
(2) A party aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Board under this
section may appeal such decision to the Superior Court as provided
by RSA 677:15, as amended.
I. Administration of impact fees.
(1) All funds collected shall be properly identified and promptly
transferred for deposit to the appropriate capital facility impact fee
account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified in the
basis of assessment adopted by the Planning Board for that capital
facility category. Impact fee accounts shall be special revenue fund
accounts and under no circumstances shall such revenues accrue
to the general fund.
(2) The Town Treasurer shall have custody of all fee accounts and shall
pay out the same only upon written orders of the Board of
Selectmen and they shall be used solely for the reimbursement of
the Town and School District for the cost of public capital
improvements for which they were collected or to recoup the cost
of capital improvements made by the Town or School District in
anticipation of the needs for which the impact fee was collected.
The Board of Selectmen shall annually order the release of school
impact fee accounts to the Salem School District, upon a
demonstration by the District of programmed expenditures eligible
for reimbursement by impact fees.
(3) The Town Treasurer shall record all fees paid, by date of payment
and the name of the person making payment, and shall maintain an
updated record of the current ownership, Tax Map and lot
reference number of properties for which fees have been paid
under this section for a period of at least nine years.
(4) At the end of each fiscal year, the Town Treasurer shall make a
report to the Board of Selectmen and the Salem School District,
giving an account of all impact fee transactions during the year.
(5) In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments have been
issued for capital facilities that are the subject of impact fee
assessments, and where improvements have been constructed in
anticipation of new development, impact fees may be used to pay
debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments.

Meeting]
J. Refund of fees paid. The owner of record of property for which an
impact fee has been paid shall be entitled to a refund of that fee, plus
accrued interest, where:
(1) The impact fee has not been encumbered or legally bound to be
spent for the purpose for which it was collected within a period of
six years from the date of the final payment of the fee; or
(2) The Town or, in the case of school impact fees, the Salem School
District has failed, within the period of six years from the date of
the final payment of such fee, to appropriate the nonimpact fee
share of related capital improvement costs.
K. Other authority retained. This section shall not be deemed to affect
other authority of the Planning Board over subdivisions and site plans,
including but not limited to:
(1) The authority of the Planning Board to declare a development to be
premature or scattered in accordance with the regulations of the
Board and in accordance with RSA 674:36, II(a);
(2) The authority of the Planning Board to require the payment of
exactions for off-site improvements for highway, drainage, sewer
and water upgrades necessitated by the development, in
accordance with the provisions of RSA 674:21, V(j); or
(3) Other authority of the Town of Salem to assess other fees under the
authority of other statutes, ordinances of the Town of Salem, or the
Salem Planning Board Site Plan Review and Subdivision
Regulations.
L. Impact fee schedules. The documents referenced in Subsection C(3)
support the impact fee schedules listed in the latest impact fee schedule
adopted by the Planning Board and available at Town Hall. Land uses
that are not within the categories listed in the schedules may require
special calculations using a comparable basis of assessment, or the
application of an assessment amount based on a land use of similar
impact. Fees shall be based on the principal use of the structure.
[Amended by the 2016 Town Meeting]
A. Purpose. This section is enacted in accordance with RSA 674:62 to
674:66 and the purposes outlined in RSA 672:1, III-a. The purpose of
this section is to accommodate small wind energy systems (SWES) in
appropriate locations while protecting the public's health, safety and
welfare. In addition, this section provides a permitting process for
SWES to ensure compliance with the provisions of the requirements
and standards established herein.
B. Definitions. See § 490-107.
§ 490-711 SALEM CODE § 490-712
1:620
C. Procedure for review.
(1) Building permit. SWES and MET towers are an accessory use
permitted in all zoning districts where structures of any sort are
allowed. No SWES shall be erected, constructed, or installed
without first receiving a building permit from the Building
Inspector. A building permit shall be required for any physical
modification to an existing small wind energy system. MET towers
that receive a building permit shall be permitted on a temporary
basis not to exceed three years from the date the building permit
was issued.
(2) Application. Applications submitted to the Building Inspector shall
contain a site plan with the following information:
(a) Property lines and physical dimensions of the applicant's
property.
(b) Location, dimensions, and types of existing major structures on
the property.
(c) Location of the proposed small wind energy system,
foundations, guy anchors and associated equipment.
(d) Tower foundation blueprints or drawings.
(e) Tower blueprints or drawings.
(f) Setback requirements as outlined in this section.
(g) The right-of-way of any public road that is contiguous with the
property.
(h) Any overhead utility lines.
(i) SWES specifications, including manufacturer, model, rotor
diameter, tower height, tower type, and nameplate generation
capacity.
(j) SWES that will be connected to the power grid shall include a
copy of the application for interconnection with their electric
utility provider.
(k) Sound level analysis prepared by the wind generator
manufacturer or qualified engineer.
(l) Electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a
determination that the manner of installation conforms to the
New Hampshire State Building Code.
(m) Evidence of compliance with or nonapplicability of Federal
Aviation Administration requirements.
(n) List of abutters to the applicant's property.
§ 490-712 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-712
1:621
(3) Abutter and regional notification. In accordance with RSA 674:66,
the Building Inspector shall notify, at the applicant's expense, all
abutters and the local governing body by certified mail upon
application for a building permit to construct a small wind energy
system. The public will be afforded 30 days to submit comments to
the Building Inspector prior to the issuance of the building permit.
The Building Inspector shall review the application for regional
impacts per RSA 36:55. If the proposal is determined to have
potential regional impacts, the Building Inspector shall follow the
procedures set forth in RSA 36:57, IV.
D. Standards. The Building Inspector shall evaluate the application for
compliance with the following standards:
(1) Setbacks. The setback shall be calculated by multiplying the
minimum setback requirement number by the system height and
measured from the center of the tower base to property line, public
roads, or nearest point on the foundation of an occupied building.

(a) SWES must meet all setbacks for principal structures for the
zoning district in which the system is located.
(b) Guy wires used to support the tower are exempt from the
SWES setback requirements.
(2) Tower. The maximum tower height shall be restricted to 35 feet
above the tree canopy within 300 feet of the small wind energy
system. In no situation shall the tower height exceed 150 feet.
(3) Sound level. The SWES shall not exceed 55 decibels using the A
scale (dBA), as measured at the site property line, except during
short-term events such as severe wind storms and utility outages.
(4) Shadow flicker. SWES shall be sited in a manner that does not
result in significant shadow flicker impacts. Significant shadow
flicker is defined as more than 30 hours per year on abutting
occupied buildings. The applicant has the burden of proving that
the shadow flicker will not have significant adverse impact on
neighboring or adjacent uses. Potential shadow flicker will be
addressed either through siting or mitigation measures.
(5) Signs. All signs, including flags, streamers and decorative items,
both temporary and permanent, are prohibited on the small wind
§ 490-712 SALEM CODE § 490-712
1:622
energy system, except for manufacturer identification or
appropriate warning signs.
(6) Code compliance. The SWES shall comply with all applicable
sections of the New Hampshire State Building Code.
(7) Aviation. The SWES shall be built to comply with all applicable FAA
regulations, including but not limited to 14 CFR Part 77, Subpart B,
regarding installations close to airports, and the New Hampshire
aviation regulations, including but not limited to RSA 422-b and
RSA 424.
(8) Visual impacts. It is inherent that SWES may pose some visual
impacts due to the tower height needed to access wind resources.
The purpose of this section is to reduce the visual impacts without
restricting the owner's access to the optimal wind resources on the
property.
(a) The applicant shall demonstrate through project site planning
and proposed mitigation that the small wind energy system's
visual impacts will be minimized for surrounding neighbors
and the community. This may include but not be limited to
information regarding site selection, wind generator design or
appearance, buffering, and screening of ground-mounted
electrical and control equipment. All electrical conduits shall
be underground, except when the financial costs are
prohibitive.
(b) The color of the SWES shall either be the stock color from the
manufacturer or painted with a nonreflective, unobtrusive
color that blends in with the surrounding environment.
Approved colors include but are not limited to white, off-white
or gray.
(c) A SWES shall not be artificially lit unless such lighting is
required by the FAA. If lighting is required, the applicant shall
provide a copy of the FAA determination to establish the
required markings and/or lights for the small wind energy
system.
(9) Approved wind generators. The manufacturer and model of the
wind generator to be used in the proposed SWES must have been
approved by the California Energy Commission or the New York
State Energy Research and Development Authority, or a similar list
approved by the State of New Hampshire, if available.
(10) Utility connection. If the proposed SWES is to be connected to the
power grid through net metering, it shall adhere to RSA 362-A:9.
(11) Access. The tower shall be designed and installed so as not to
provide step bolts or a ladder readily accessible to the public for a
minimum height of eight feet above the ground. All ground-
§ 490-712 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 490-712
1:623
mounted electrical and control equipment shall be labeled and
secured to prevent unauthorized access.
(12) Clearing. Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that
which is necessary for the construction, operation and
maintenance of the SWES and as otherwise prescribed by
applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances.
E. Abandonment.
(1) At such time that a SWES is scheduled to be abandoned or
discontinued, the applicant will notify the Building Inspector by
certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of abandonment or
discontinuation of operations.
(2) Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the owner shall
physically remove the SWES within 90 days from the date of
abandonment or discontinuation of use. This period may be
extended at the request of the owner and at the discretion of the
Building Inspector. "Physically remove" shall include but not be
limited to:
(a) Removal of the wind generator and tower and related abovegrade
structures.
(b) Restoration of the location of the SWES to its natural
condition, except that any landscaping, grading or below-grade
foundation may remain in its same condition at initiation of
abandonment.
(3) In the event that an applicant fails to give such notice, the system
shall be considered abandoned or discontinued if the system is out
of service for a continuous twelve-month period. After the 12
months of inoperability, the Building Inspector may issue a notice
of abandonment to the owner of the small wind energy system. The
owner shall have the right to respond to the notice of abandonment
within 30 days from notice receipt date. After review of the
information provided by the owner, the Building Inspector shall
determine if the SWES has been abandoned. If it is determined that
the SWES has not been abandoned, the Building Inspector shall
withdraw the notice of abandonment and notify the owner of the
withdrawal.
(4) If the owner fails to respond to the notice of abandonment or if,
after review by the Building Inspector, it is determined that the
SWES has been abandoned or discontinued, the owner of the SWES
shall remove the wind generator and tower at the owner's sole
expense within three months of receipt of the notice of
abandonment. If the owner fails to physically remove the SWES
after the notice of abandonment procedure, the Building Inspector
may pursue legal action to have the SWES removed at the owner's
expense.

suffered.
(b) Granting the permit would be of benefit to the public interest.
(c) Denial of the permit would result in unnecessary hardship to
the owner seeking it. "Financial hardship" in this connection
does not mean personal financial hardship of the owner but
means that the land, building or structure, if required to be
§ 490-901 SALEM CODE § 490-901
1:636
§ 490-902. Enforcement.

the spirit of this chapter.
(2) No other criteria shall be imposed by the ZBA, and no other

be upon the applicant. The ZBA may attach reasonable conditions
to the granting of any variance.
L. Conduct of deliberations; public access to information. In making its
deliberations, the ZBA shall not receive or consider any evidence not
submitted to it in public hearing. Any party to a hearing before the ZBA

such request submitted to it in the public hearing upon such matter.

granted by the ZBA shall be terminated two years from its issuance by
the ZBA unless the variance or exception granted has been exercised by
the recipient. However, this subsection shall not preclude the earlier
invalidity of a variance or exception if, prior to its exercise by the
recipient, the circumstances in existence at the time of its issuance
have altered appreciably. [Amended by the 2015 Town Meeting]
